PREFACE 

It is a little over ten years since the first volume of my 
History of Dharmasastra was published. In the preface to that 
volume I expressed the hope that time and health permitting 
I might issue in a few years the second volume dealing with the 
development of the various subjects comprised in Dharmasastra. 
For several years thereafter whatever leisure I could secure 
from professional work was devoted to the collection and 
orderly assortment of the vast Literature on Dharmasastra. 
After my return from a few months* visit to Europe in 1937 
I commenced the work of writing the second volume. It soon 
became apparent to me that to compress within the limits of a 
single volume the development of the thousand and one topics 
that fall within the purview of Dharmasastra would present 
only a scrappy and faint outline of the whole field. To add to 
the difficulties of my task my old painful complaint ( duodenal 
ulcer ) recurred with far greater virulence than before, so much 
so that, partly on medical advice and partly out of despair, in 
October 1938 I gave up the work altogether. When relief did 
not come even after six months* total abstinence from literary 
labours I resumed, in spite of my extremely painful oomplaint, the 
work of writing, for fear that otherwise the extensive materials that 
J had been collecting for nearly two decades might be entirely 
lost to the world of Sanskrit scholars and that my labours might 
be altogether wasted. Being afraid that my strength and resolu- 
tion may not last till the completion of the rather ambitious 
undertaking, I decided upon bringing out in two volumes the 
development of the various subjects comprised in Dharmasastra. 
The present volume contains the treatment of varna and 
asrama, the samskaras, ahnika and acSra, dana, pratistha and 
utsarga, and srauta ( vedic ) sacrifices. The next volume ( the 
last) will deal with the following topics: vyavahara (Law and 
procedure), asauoa (impurity on birth and death), sraddha, 
pr&yascitta, tlrtha, vrata, k&la, santi, the influence of the Purva* 
mlmarhsa and other sastras on Dharmasastra, customs and 
usages modifying Dharmasastra, the philosophical background 
of Dharmasastra, and future developments in Dharmasastra. 
Looking to my past performance I am unwilling to make 
any promise about the time when the next volume may be 

H.D. A 



ii History of Dharmaiastra 

expected to be published. I may state, however, that in view 
of the fact that at present I am in much better health than I 
have been for several years I shall try to publish it in three 
years more. 

Excellent works dealing with distinct topics of Dharmasastra 
have been given to the world by eminent scholars. But so far 
as I know no writer has yet attempted single-handed to survey 
the whole field of Dharmasastra. From that point of view this 
volume partakes of the nature of a pioneer undertaking. It is 
therefore to be expected that such an ambitious project will 
manifest the defects of all pioneer work. The circumstances 
(adverted to above) in which this work had to be written and 
the great hurry with which it had to be rushed through are other 
factors that are responsible for the awkward or obscure expres- 
sions and the errors that it may oontain. I mention these matters 
for lessening the surprise that such blemishes might lead my 
friends to feel and not for blunting the edge of adverse briti- 
cism. The critic is certainly entitled to mercilessly criticizo 
the work for its shortcomings and mistakes. Some readers 
may complain that the present work is prolix, while others 
may say that the space devoted to several topics is meagre. 
I have tried to pursue a middle course. 

There was great temptation throughout this work to com- 
pare ancient and medieval Indian customs, usages and beliefs 
as disclosed by dharmasastra works with those of other peoples 
and countries. But I have tried to omit, as far as possible, 
such comparisons. Whenever I indulge in them I do so for 
several reasons. It is the fashion among many writers, both 
European and Indian, to hold the caste system and the dharma- 
sastra view of life responsible for most of the evils from which 
India suffers at present. To a very large extent I do not subscribe 
to that view. I have endeavoured to show that human nature 
being the same in essentials throughout the world, the same 
tendencies and evils manifest themselves in all countries, the 
same abuses prevail and the same perversions of originally 
beneficent institutions take place everywhere and anywhere, 
whether particular countries or societies are within the grip of 
the caste system or any other casteless system. Undoubtedly 
the caste system has in fact produced certain evils, but it is not 
singular in this respect. No system is perfect and immune from 
evil effects. Though I have been brought up in the midst of the 
Brahmanical system, I hope it will be conceded by scholars 



Preface Hi 

that I have shown both sides of the picture and that I have 
endeavoured to write with detachment. 

A few words must be said about the extensive quotations 
from Sanskrit works and the references to modern Indian Legis- 
lation and case-law. For those who cannot read English (most 
pandits and iastris do not ) the quotations will be of great help 
in understanding at least the trend of the arguments. Besides 
Indian scholars are as a class poor and cannot afford to pur- 
chase numerous books. Nor are there many good libraries in 
India where all works of reference can be had. For all these 
reasons thousands of quotations have been cited in the footnotes. 
The quotations are mostly drawn from published works and 
references to mss. are few and far between. I hope that the 
numerous quotations will not intrude themselves on the atten- 
tion of those who want to read only the English portion of the 
work. Legislative enactments and case-law have been referred 
to for showing that many regulations of dharma&astra are 
still very much alive, that they govern the every-day life 
of Hindus and permeate all classes of Hindu society in spite of 
the fact that a considerable part of dharmaSastra has become 
obsolete. Similar remarks apply to the numerous references 
to inscriptions on stone and copper. These latter serve to prove 
that rules laid down in the dharma^astra were throughout two 
thousand years observed by the people and enforced by kings 
and that such rules were not mere precepts composed by 
dreamers or scholastic pedants. 

I acknowledge with great pleasure that I am under deep 
obligations to many predecessors and workers in the same and 
other fields and to many friends. Among the works to which 
I had to refer constantly and from which I derived the greatest 
benefit I must specially refer to the following : Bloomfieid's 
Vedic Concordance, the Vedic Index of Professors Macdonell 
and Keith, the Sacred Books of the East edited by Max Mviller 
( vol. II, VII, XII, XIV, XXV, XXVI, XXIX, XXX, XXXIIII, 
XLI, XLIII, XLIV). As I was handicapped by the fact that I 
know little German and less French, I could not fully utilise all 
the work done by modern European scholars. I am highly obliged 
to Paramahamsa KevalSnanda SvamI of Wai for constant help 
and guidance (particularly in the 6rauta portion); to ChintSman- 
fcastri Datar of Poona for assistance in the chapter on dar&a- 
puri?am5sa and for carefully going through the other ohapters 
on&rauta; to Mr. Keshav Lakshraan Ogaie for his work on a 



iv History of DharmaifiBtra 

portion of the Index ; to Tarkatlrtha Raghunftthas&strl Kokje for 
reading through the whole work and suggesting additions and 
emendations. 

Besides, assistance in various ways during the progress 
of the work for over three years was very kindly rendered by a 
host of friends, among whom I should like to make special 
mention of Prof. H. D. Velankar, Prof. Rangaswami Ayyangar 
Prof. P. P. S. SSstrl, Dr. Alsdorf , Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya, 
Mr. N. G. Chapekar, Mr. G. H. Khare, Mr. N. C. Bapat, Pandit 
Rangacharya Raddi, Mr. L. S. Dravid (aSSmavedl ofPoona), 
Pandit S. D. Satavlekar, Mr. P. K. Gode. Thanks are due to all 
these and other friends for their help and interest in this volume, 
I must state, however, that I alone am responsible for the views 
and mistakes contained in this work. 

In a work containing thousands of quotations and refe- 
rences it is very likely that many slips have occurred. Besides 
it is very much to be regretted that several misprints have crept 
into the footnotes by the loss or displacement of dots and other 
loose parts of Sanskrit letters in the process of printing.

by smrtikaras before niyoga could be resorted to. Breach of the 
conditions severely condemned and made punishable. Some 
even very ancient writers on dharma did not allow this practice. 
The Mahabharata is full of examples of niyoga. Some writers 
held that texts permitting niyoga applied to sudras or to girls 
who were only promised in marriage to a person but not 
actually married to him ( as he died in the meantime ). Three 
views upon the question ' to whom the child born of niyoga 
belonged.' Niyoga forbidden in the Kali age by Brhaspati and

the dharmasutras and smrtis. Tridandi and ekadandi ascetics. 
Four kinds of ascetics, kuticaka, bahudaka, hamsa and parama- 
hamsa and their characteristics. Popular notion that the 
paramaharhsa is beyond all rules and prohibitions combated by 
ancient texts. Vidvat-samnyasa and vividisa-sarhnyasa. The 
turiyatita and avadhuta kinds of ascetics. Opinions as to 
whether samnyasa was allowed only to brahmanas or to all 
three varnas. According to smrtis and medieval works a sudra 
could not beoome an ascetic. Women in rare cases adopted 
the ascetic mode of life. The word samnyasa conveys two dis- 
tinct ideas. Some held that samnyasa was meant only for the 
blind and the cripple. Ascetics were to give up wife and 
home and were not to revert to householder's life. Ten orders 
of advaita samnyasins following Samkaracarya's doctrines and

according to Dharmasindhu. Principal elements are; eight 
sraddhas, savitripravesa, virajahoma, declaration of leaving 
home, all wealth and desires and taking vow of ahimsa, giving 
up of topknot and sacred thread, teaching by guru of panel- 
karana and mahavakyas (like tat tvam-asi), giving of anew 
name by the teacher, yogapatta (p. 962), paryanka-sauca. 
Samnyasa in extremis ( afcura-sarhnyasa ). Controversies about 
giving up sikha and yajnopavlta. Daily duties of an ascetic. 
No impurity on his death for his relatives and vice versa. 
Ascetic heads of mathas olaim in modern times jurisdic- 
tion in matters of caste, excommunication, expiations for 
lapses. In anoient times parisads (assemblies of learned 



Synopsis of Contents xxv 

men ) exercised these functions and kings acted on their advice. 
The number of persons required to constitute a parisad for 
deciding a doubtful point about dharma. Sistas constitute a 
parisad. Meaning of 6ista. The council of eight ministers 
established by Shivaji and the duties of the Panditrao, one of 
these eight. Panditrao took advice of the parisads of learned 
brahmanas on questions of re-admission of converts, expiations 
&c. Many features of asceticism are common to all religions. 
It is a partial truth that Indians have the highest regard for 
the ascetic.

HISTORY OF DHARMASASTRA 

VOLUME II 

CHAPTER I 

THE TOPICS OF DHARMASASTRA 

Manifold are the topics that have been included under 
Dharmasastra from very ancient times. The Dharma-sutras 
of Gautama, Baudhayana, Apastamba and Vasistha deal in 
greater or less detail principally with the following subjects : 
the several varrias ( classes ), airamas ( stages of life ), their 
privileges, obligations and responsibilities ; the samskaras 
performed on an individual (from garbhadhana to antyesti); 
the duties of the brahmacarin ( the first asrama ) ; anadhyayas 
( holidays on which Vedic study was stopped ) ; the duties of a 
snataka ( one who has finished the first stage of life ) ; vivaha 
( marriage ) and all matters connected therewith ; the duties of 
the grhastha ( house-holder's stage ) ; iauca ( daily purification 
of body ) ; the five daily yajnas ; dana ( gifts ) ; bhaksyabhaksya 
( what food should one partake of and what not ) ; iuddhi ( puri- 
fication of persons, vessels, clothes &c. ) ; aiauca ( impurity 
on birth and death ) ; antyesti ( ritea on death ) ; iraddha ( rites 
performed for the deceased ancestors and relatives ) ; stridharma 
( special duties of women ) and stripwhdharma ( duties of 
husband and wife ) ; dharmas of ksatriyas and of kings ; vyava* 
hara (judicial procedure, and the sphere of substantive law 
such as crimes and punishments, contracts, partition and 
inheritance, adoption, gambling &c); the four principal classes, 
mixed castes and their proper avocations ; apaddharma ( actions 
and avocations permitted to the several castes in extreme 
difficulties ) ; prctyaicitta ( sins and how to expiate them ) ; 
karmavipaka ( results of evil deeds done in past lives ) ; ianti 
(rites on the happening of portents or for propitiating the 
planets &c. ) ; duties of vanaprastha ( forest hermit ) and 
samnyasin ( ascetic ). All these subjects are not treated in any 
fixed or settled order in the sufcra works. To take only one 
example, the subject of partition and inheritance occurs at 
the end of the dharmasutra of Gautama, while Vasistha 
places the same subject in the middle of his work (17th 
chapter ) and Apastamba deals with those topics after finishing 



t History of Dharmat&stra' [ Oh. I 

three-fourths of his work ( in II. 6. 14 ). Further, some works on 
dharmaiastra give very elaborate treatment of certain topics of 
which only faint traoes are found in the ancient dharmasutras 
and metrical smrtis. Such topics are vratas ( which may be 
looked upon as extensions of the subject of gifts ), utsarga and 
pratistha (dedication of works of public utility and of temples 
and shrines), tirtha (sacred places and pilgrimages to them), 
kola ( auspioious times, festivals &c. ). 

A glance at the above list will convince anyone how the 
conception of dharma was a far-reaching one, how it embraoed 
the whole life of man. The writers on dharraasastra meant by 
dharma not a creed or religion but a mode of life or a code of 
conduct, which regulated a man's work and activities as a 
member of society and as an individual and was intended to bring 
about the gradual development of a man and to enable him to 
reach what was deemed to be the goal of human existence. 

From this standpoint various divisions of dharma were 
suggested. Dharma was divided into irauta and smarta. The 
first comprised those rites and ceremonies with which the Vedic 
Samhitas and BrShmanas were chiefly concerned, such as con- 
secration of the three sacred fires, the Full moon and New moon 
sacrifices, the solemn soma rites &c. The smUrta comprised 
those topics that were specially dealt with by the smrtis and 
that concerned the various classes and stages of life. 1 The 
present work will concern itself principally with smarta dharma 
and irauta dharma will be dealt with concisely in an appendix. 
Some works divide dkarma into irauta (Vedic), smarta (based 
upon smrtis) and iistacara (the actions of the respected in 
society )*. This classification is based on the three sources of 
dharma viz., iruti, smrti and iistacara^ as observed by Baudha- 
yana.* Another and more comprehensive classification says 
that dharma is sixfold, viz. dharma of varnas (injunctions 
based on varna alone such as *a brahmana should never drink 
wine* or 'a brfihmana should not be killed'), airamadharma

(such rules as ' begging * and ' carrying a staff ' enjoined on a

on a man because he belongs to a particular class and is in a 
particular stage of life, such as ' a brahmana brahmacari should 
carry a staff of palaia tree ), gwQadharma ( such as protection of 
subjects in the case of a crowned king ), naimittika dharma 
(such as expiation on doing what is forbidden), sadharava 
dharma ( what is common to all humanity viz,, ahiinsa and other 
virtues ). 4 This classification appears to have been an ancient 
one. Medhatifchi on Manu II. 25 speaks of fivefold dharma 
(only omitting sadharaqa dharma from the abovementioned 
six ) and quotes the explanations of them from the expounders 
of smrfcis. Hemadri ( vrata-khanda p. 5 ) quotes 16 verses from 
the Bhavisyapurana on the six-fold dharma. 5 It will be noticed 
from the abovajihat all matters ( except sadharava or samanya

Before embarking upon any treatment of varrias it would 
not be out of place to say a few words about dharmas common 
to all humanity. Our dharmasastra works do not enter into 
any subtle or detailed examination of the principles of ethics 
or of the moral standard, nor are the concepts of duty, happi- 
ness or perfection subjected to any searching analysis 6 . But

unsympathetic and supercilious attitude of a Christian missionary. 
Its key-note is perverse inasmuch as the foundation of the author's 
criticism is the notion that one is not really moral unless one ia 
engaged in active social service. There is very little warrant foe

this does not at all mean that; the principles of ethics were 
passed over by dharmasastra works or were not highly thought 
of by them. From very ancient times truth is exalted above 
everything else, ftgveda VII. 104. 12 says 7 * True speech and 

( Continued from last page) 
this hypothesis in well-knownj works on Ethics. To expose the 
fallacies in Principal McKenzie's work would require a volume. But a 
few words must be said here. What particular brand of active social 
service the learned author has in view is difficult to follow. I would 
like to make him a present of the following lines from the Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica on Sooial Service * The term social service is a 
comparatively new one in Great Britain. If it had been used previous 
to the 20th century it would have meant philanthropy and charity 
in the ordinary sense \ If the learned author means that ancient 
India never insisted on universal philanthropy and charity, he has 
read the Indian Literature in vain. Every house-holder was called 
upon by the Hindu Sffstras to offer food according to his ability to 
students, ascetics and to all beings including the untouchable cSnda"las 
and even dogs and crows. Every brShmana who could teach had to do 
so without demanding any fee beforehand. Maths were established 
in all parts of India for expounding religious books, feeding students 
and the poor. There are annasatras even now where hundreds are 
fed every day. No necessity arose throughout the ages for a Poor 
Law in India with its attendant evils well portrayed in Dickens' 
famous master-piece 'Oliver Twist \ The above were some of the 
different aspects of philanthropy and charity which are now dubbed 
social service. In the third century B. C. Adoka had established 
hospitals not only for men but even for beasts and YSj. 1.209 equates 
the free nursing of siok persons with gifts of cows. The learned 
Professor asks with an air of triumph and condemnation of all 
Indian morality ( p. 251 ) ' Is there anything comparable to the 
movement which St. Francis of Assisi initiated and led ? ' The learned 
Professor has fallen into the frequent error of comparing a move- 
ment of the 13th century with Indian ideas over 2000 years old. Again 
I shall quote words from the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 'It would be 
an anachronism to think of Francis as a philanthropist or social worker 
or a revivalist preaoher, though he fulfilled the functions of all these. 
Before every thing he was an ascetic and mystic \ The particular 
brands of Social Service that are now in vogue are mainly due to the 
ravages of Imperialism and extreme capitalistic tendencies. Besides 
he forgets that even the movement started by St. Francis had schisms 
and was guilty of all the moral evils that are associated with Western 
monastic institutions. Vide the recent and lucid book of Sir Sivaswamy 
Alyer on Evolution of Hindu moral ideals' (1935, Calcutta 
University ).

false speech run a race against each other. Soma protects 
out of the two what is true and what is very straight-forward 
and strikes down what is false \ The conception of Ha in the 
Rgveda is a sublime one and is the germ of the later doctrine 
of the rule of dharma. The Satapatha-brahmana ( S. B. E. vol. 
44 p. 85) enjoins ' therefore let a man speak naught but truth' 8 . 
In the Taittirlyopanisad ( I. II. 1 ), the teacher when taking 
leave of his pupil at the end of the latter's studenthood places 
truth in the forefront of his exhortation and dharma next. 9 
In the Chandogya ( III. 17 ) there is an allegory of a Soma 
sacrifice on life, where the daksina ( fee to be paid ) is fivefold 
viz. the five virtues of tapas ( asceticism ), dana ( charity ), 
arjava ( straightforwardness ), ahimsa ( non-injury to sentient 
beings), satyavaoana (truthfulness). The Br. Up. remarks 
that truth and dharma are in practical life identical terms. 10 
One of the noblest prayers in all literature occurs in the Br. 
Up. ( I. 3.28 ) * from falsehood lead me unto truth, from darkness 
lead me unto light, from death lead me unto immortality \ 
The Mundakopanisad says * only truth is victorious and not 
falsehood ; the path of the gods is spread out by ( the pursuit 
of) truth*. The Br. Up. inculcates on all the great need 
of three cardinal virtues, viz. self-restraint, daya ( compassion 
or love for all sentient life) and dana (gifts or charity). 11 
The Chan. Up. says that the world of Brahman is free from all 
evil and only those who have lived as chaste students can enter 
the world of brahma. The Chan. Up. V. 10 sternly condemns five 
sins, viz. theft of gold, drinking spirits, murder of a brahmana, 
defiling of one's guru's bed and association with these, as 
the greatest sins and in V. 11. 5 A^vapati exultantly 
declares that in his kingdom there were no grave sinners. The 
Kathopanisad ( I. 2.23 ) insists ia upon cessation from evil

conduct, peace of mind and concentration as essential for the 
seeker after the Self. The Udyogaparva 43.20ff. speaks of the 
twelve vratas ( vows or rules of conduct ) for brahmanas and 
verses 22-25 describe at great length the characteristics of one 
who is danta ( self-controlled ). Santi 160 contains an eulogy 
of dama ( self-control ). Santi 162.7 describes how satya has 13 
aspects and verse 21 says that non-injury to all beings in 
thought, word and deed, good will and charity are the eternal 
dharma of the good. 13 The Gautama-dharmasutra ( VIII. 
24-26 ) holds that daya ( compassion or love for all beings), ksanti 
( forebearance ), anasuya ( freedom from envy ), sauca ( purity of 
body, speech and thought ), anayasa ( absence of painful efforts 
or ambitions ), mangala ( doing what is commended ), akarpanya 
( not demeaning oneself before others ), asprha ( not hankering 
after sensual pleasures or the possessions of others ) u are the 
qualities of the soul and remarks that the person who has these 
eight qualities realizes non- difference from Brahma and 
reaches the world of Brahma, though he may not have all the 
other forty samskaras, while he who has all the forty samskaras 
but is not possessed of these eight qualities does not reach the 
world of Brahma. 15 Vasistha ( X. 30 ) says that avoiding back- 
biting, jealousy, pride, egoism, unbelief, crookedness, self-praise, 
abuse of others, deceit, covetousness, delusion, anger and envy 
is the dharma of all asramas and further (XXX. 1 ) he delivers 
a fine exhortation * practise dharma ( righteousness ) and not 
adharma; speak the truth and nob untruth ; look far ahead, not

similarly but in different words. AparSrka (pp. 164-165), Smrticandrika" 
( 1. p. 13 ), HemBdri ( Vrata p. 8 ) and ParfftSaramadhaviya I. part 1 p. 84

beings) is at the top of the eight Stmaguoas and28i31-32 for a slightly 
different enumeration of the eight. VisnupurSna ( III. 8.35-37 ) says 
that these eight mentioned by Gautama (fafcTSTT being substituted

near; look at what is highest, not at what is not highest 1 . 
Apastamba Dh. S. ( I. 8. 23. 3-6 ) calls upon all akamas to era- 
dicate faults that tend to destruction and to cultivate the oppo- 
site virtues (and gives long lists of both). This shows that in 
the soale of values mere performance of sacrifices and purifica- 
tory and other religious ceremonies ranked according to 
Gautama and other writers very low and the highest value 
attached to the moral qualities of the soul. There is no elabo- 
rate discussion of the questions as to why a man should tell the 
truth or abstain from himsa (injury to sentient beings) and 
cultivate other high moral qualities. But it should not be 
supposed that no indications whatever are given of the reasons 
why this should be done. Two principles emerge if we closely 
examine the texts. In the midst of countless rules of outward 
conduct there is always insistence on the necessity to satisfy 
the inner man (antara-purusa) or conscience. Manu IV. 161 
says ' assiduously do that which will give satisfaction to the 
antaratman' (inner self ); IV. 239 says 'No parents, nor wife 
nor sons will be a man's friends in the next world ; but only 
righteousness.' 'Gods and the inner man mark the sinful acts ' 
Vanaparva 207-54 and Manu VIII. 85, 91-92. Vide also Adi- 
parva 74. 23-29, Manu VIII. 86, Anusasana 2. 73-74. The 
reason given for cultivating such virtues as daya, ahimsa is 
based upon the philosophical doctrine of the one Self being 
immanent in every individual as said in the words 'tat tvam-asi*. 
This is the highest point reached in Indian metaphysics and 
combines morality and metaphysics. That doctrine requires us 
to regard the goodness or badness of one*s actions from the 
standpoint of other individuals who will be affected by such 
actions. Daksa (III. 22) declares ie ' one who desires happiness 
should look upon another just as he looks upon himself. Happi- 
ness and misery affect one's self and others in the same way \ 
Devala says that the quintessence of dharma is that one should 
not do to others what would be disliked by one's self. 17 There-

tore our texts lay down two seats of authority in morals viz., 
the revealed truth (6ruti) that 'All this is brahma* and the inner 
light of conscience. Another reason for cultivating high moral 
qualities is found in the doctrine of the goals or ends of human 
existence (purusartha). From very ancient times they are said 
to be four, dharraa (right conduct ), artha ( economic interests ), 
kama ( satisfaction of sexual, emotional and artistic life ), 
moksa ( liberation of the spirit ). The last is said to be the 
supreme end and to be attained only by the few and the vast 
majority can only place it as an ideal to be attained in the 
most distant future. As regards the other three, there is a 
gradation of values. Kama is the lowest of all and only fools 
regard it as the only end. 18 The MahSbharata says : ' A wise 
man tries to secure all three, but if all three cannot be attained, 
he secures dharma and artha or only dharma if he has a ohoice 
of only one from among the three. A man of middling disci- 
pline prefers artha to the other two ; dharma is the source of 
both artha and kama.' The dharma^astra writers did not 
condemn kama altogether, they recognise that kama has a place 
as a motive urging men to be active but they assigned it a low 
place. They recognised that a man shares with lower beings 
the impulses and emotions of sex, but that the satisfaction of 
these impulses is of lower values than the moral and spiritual 
ends proper for a developed human personality and therefore 
insist that it should be subordinated to artha and dharma. 
Gautama ( IX 46-47 ) says ' one should not allow the morning, 
midday and evening to remain fruitless so far as dharma, artha 
and kama are concerned. But among these three one should 
attach most importance to dharma.* Yaj. I. 115 says practically 
the same thing. Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 8. 20. 22-23 ) declares that 
â¢ a man should enjoy all such pleasures as are not opposed to

dharma. In this way one secures both worlds '. ,f In the 
Bhagavadglta ( VII. 11 ) Krsna identifies himself with kUma 
that is not opposed to dharma. Kautilya says 80 ' one may enjoy 
kama provided there is no conflict with dharma and artha, one 
should not lead a life of no pleasures * and then true to his 
role of a writer on arthasastra, he proclaims that his own 
opinion is that artha is the principal of the three, as dharma and 
kama both spring from artha. 9 Manu ( II. 224 ) 81 after setting out 
several views about which oflhe three is principal states it as 
his own opinion that one should strive for all the three, but 
adds that if artha or kama is in conflict with dharma one should 
give up artha or kama as the case may be. Visnu Dh. S. 
(71. 84) and Bhagavata 1. 2. 9 say the same. The Kamasutra 88 of 
Vatsyayana defines the three and says that out of dharma, artha 
and kama each preceding one is superior to each following one 
and that to the king artha should be the highest goal. This 
teaching shows that there are proximate ends or motives and 
ultimate ends or motives, that the ultimate ends are really the 
most valuable and that the whole teaching of dharmasastra 
points to this that all higher life demands discipline both of 
body and mind and requires the subjection of lower aims to 
aims of higher value. Manu II. 4 ( like Aristotle in the first 
sentence of his Politics) says that the end of all activity is some 
presumed good. Manu further says ( V. 56 ) that the natural 
proclivity of all beings is to hanker after the satisfaction of the 
common and lower desires of hunger, thirst and sexual gratifica- 
tion and therefore no stress is to be placed on them but on the 
oessation or curbing of these. The Upanisads 8 * recognise the

distinction between what is beneficial ( hita ) and what is most 
beneficial ( kitatama ). Santiparva ( 288. 20 and 330. 13 ) declares 
that what conduces to the greatest good of beings is ' satya.' 

The MitaksarS on Yaj. 1. 1. remarks that ahimsa and other 
qualities are the dharmas common to all including even 
cSndalas. The qualities are variously enumerated and emphasis 
is laid upon different lists in different works. Sankhasmrti (I. 5) 
says that forbearance, truthfulness, self-restraint and purity 
are common to all vaTnas. The Mahabharata says that three 
are the best qualities among all beings viz., absence of enmity, 
truthfulness and freedom from anger 84 and in another place 
says that the best vrata ( vow ) for a man is threefold viz., he 
should feel no enmity ( to others ), should give and should speak 
the truth. Vasistha ( IV. 4 ) says 85 that truthfulness, freedom 
from anger, generosity, ahimsa ( non-injury ) and procreation of 
offspring are ( the common dharma ) of all ( varnas ). Gautama 
(X. 52 ) says that even the Sudra has to submit himself to the 
dharma of truthfulness, freedom from anger and purity ( of 
body and mind ). Manu says that ahimsa, truthfulness, no 
wrongful taking of another's possessions, purity and restraint of 
senses are in brief the common dharmas of all varnas. 26 Manu 
( IV. 175 ) calls upon all to take delight in truth, in dharma, in 
conduct worthy of an Srya and in purity. In the 3rd century 
B. C. the remarkable emperor A&oka inscribed on stone in all 
parts of his empire the following list of virtues : compassion, 
liberality, truth, purity gentleness, peace, joyousness, saintli- 
ness, self-control ; which bear a close resemblance to Gautama's 
list and even to a later list of St. Paul ( vide Pillar Edicts II 
and VII in E. I. vol. II p. 249 and p. 272 ). Yaj. ( 1. 122 ) men- 
tions nine qualities as the means of securing dharma for all 
( from the brahmaria to the candala 87 ). The Mahabharata says 
that freedom from anger, truthfulness, sharing one's wealth

with others, forbearance, procreation ( of children ; irurn one's 
wife ( alone ), purity, absence of enmity, straight-forwardness, 
maintaining persons dependent on one-self â these nine are the 
duties of all varnas. 88 The Vamanapurana says that tenfold 
dharma is common to all and names these ten as ahimsa, satija* 
as(eya t dana, forbearance, restraint, quiescence, not demeaning 
oneself, purity, tapas. 29 Hemadri ( vratakhanda pp. 7-8 ) quotes 
several passages from the Brahma, Brahmavaivarta and Visnu- 
dharmottara for several sftdharana d bar mas ( virtues common 
to all varnas and Ssraraas ). The Visnudharmasutra enume- 
rates fourteen qualities as samanya-dharma. 50 

The foregoing discussion establishes that all dharmasastra 
writers attached the highest importance to moral qualities and 
enjoined them upon all with all the emphasis they could 
command; but as their main purpose was a practical one, viz., 
to guide people to right acts in everyday life, they dealt more 
elaborately with the acts, rites and ceremonies that each person 
had to do with reference to his station in society. They are 
therefore found principally concerning themselves with varnS- 
srama dharma and not with sadharava dharma ( i. e. duties 
common to all alike ). 

Aryavarta â One important question that is very much 
canvassed in works on dharmasastra is about the country or 
territory which should be called aryavarta or which was a fit 
habitation for those who called themselves the followers of the 
Vedic religions Therefore a few wordr on this subject would be 
quite relevant. The Rgveda shows chat the centre of Aryan

rivers, viz. North-west India and Punjab., We find that fche 
rivers from Kubha ( the Kabul river, in Rg. V. 53. 9 ; x. 76. 6 ), 
Krumu ( the modern Kurram, Rg. V. 53. 9, X. 75. 6 ), SuvSstu 
( modern Swat, in Rg. VIII. 19. 37 ), the seven Sindhus ( Rg. II. 
12. 12, IV. 28. 1, VIII. 24. 27, X. 43. 3 ) up to the Yamuna 
( Rg. V. 52. 17, X 75. 5 ), the Ganges ( Rg. VI. 45. 31, X 75.5 ) 
and Sarayu ( probably in modern Oudh, in Rg. IV. 30. 18 and 
V. 53. 9 ) figure in the Rgveda. Among the rivers of the Punjab 
the following are individually mentioned : â Sindhu ( Rg. II. 
15. 6 *he made the Sindhu flow northwards', Rg. V. 53. 9, 
Rg. IV. 30. 12, Rg. VIII. 20. 25 where reference is made to the 
medicine in the Sindhu, in the Asiknl, in the seas and on 
mountains), Asiknl ( Rg. VIII. 20. 25, X. 75. 5), Parusnl 
( Rg. IV. 22. 2, V. 52. 9 ), Vipas and Sutudri ( Rg. III. 33. 1 
where their confluence is spoken of ), Vipas alone in Rg. IV. 30. 
12, Sutudri alone in Rg. X. 75. 5,' DrsadvatI, Apaya and Sara- 
svatl (as very holy in Rg. III. 23. 4), SarasvatI alone (Rg. VII. 
95, fche whole hymn is addressed to it of which verse 2 says it 
springs from fche mountains; Rg. VI. 61 is another hymn 
addressed to it, v. 10 of which says it has seven sisters ), 
GomatI ( Rg. VIII. 24. 30, X. 75. 6 ), Vitasta ( Rg. X. 75. 5 ). 
Gradually the Aryans spread southwards and eastwards. 
The Kanaka S. X. 6 speaks of Kuru-Paficalas. In the Brah- 
maipias the centre of Aryan activities and culture shifted fco the 
countries of the Kurus and Pancalas and Kosala-Videhas . 
For example, the Satapatha Brahmana remarks that in the lands 
of Kurupanc&las speech is at its best. 31 In Sat. Br. XL 4. 1. 
1 Uddalaka Aruni is called a Kuru-Pancala brahmana and 
contrasted with brahmanas of the north ( S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 51 ). 
Similarly the Kausltaki-br. ( VII. 6 ) remarks 88 that those who 
want to learn ( best ) speech go northwards or wait upon him 
who comes from that direction. In fche Satapatha we have the 
story of Videgha Ma^hava who went beyond the country of 
Kosala-Videha, crossed the river Sadanlra that oame down from 
the Himalaya, and settled to the east of that river, where the 
country was a cultivated and civilized one in the times of that 
work, while in former ages it had been uncultivated (I. 4. 1. 
4-17, S. B. E. vol. 12 pp. 105-106.). Even in the Buddhist

Jatakas we see that being an 'udicoa brfthmano' was a source 
of great pride ( vide Fick's work p. 40 ). The Tai. Br. speaks of 
the vedi of the gods as being in Kuru-ksetra. 83 Even in the 
Rgveda itself the country through 1 which the rivers DreadvatI, 
ApayS and SarasvatI flowed is spoken of as the best spot 
( vide III. 23. 4 ). The Tai. Br. says that the Kurupancalas go 
east in the winter and westwards in the last month of summer. 
In the times of the Upanisads also the Kurupancala country 
appears to have occupied a pre-eminent place. The Br. Up. 
( III. 1. 1. ) says that when Janaka, king of Videha, performed 
a sacrifice the brahmanas of Kurupaficala flocked there in large 
numbers. Vide also Br. Up. III. 9. 19. The Br. Up. VI 2. 1 and 
Chandogya V. 3. 1 say that Svetaketu went to the assembly of 
the Pancalas. Kausltaki Br. Up. ( IV. 1. ) names the countries 
of U&Inara, Matsya, Kurupancala and KaSivideha as centres of 
intellectual activity and in II. 13 refers to two mountains 
one in the North and the other in the South ( meaning probably 
Himavat and Vindhya ). According to the Nirukta ( II. 2 ), 
the country of Kamboja was outside the limits of the country 
of Aryas, though the language spoken there seems to have been 
the same. The Mahabhasya lends support to this and adds that 
Sur&sfra was not an Arya country ( vol. 1, p. 9 ). In the times 
of the Dharmasutras great divergence of opinion prevailed on 
the question of the location of Aryavarta. The Vasistha- 
dharma 24 -sutra says: ' Aryavarta is to the east of the disappea- 
rance ( of SarasvatI in the desert ), to the west of Kalakavana, 
to the north of the mountains Pariyatra and Vindhya and to 
the south of the Himalaya \ It then refers to two more views 
held by other authors viz., ' Aryavarta is in the region between 
the Ganges and the Jumna * and ' where the black antelope 
roams about there is spiritual pre-eminence \ The Baud. D. S. 
( I. 1.27 ) gives the same limits of Aryavarta as Vasistfia,

substituting the word ' vinasana * for ' adarsa'. 35 Pataiijali in 
his Mahabhasya defines Aryavarta several times in the same 
terms as Vasis^ha does. 88 The Dharmasutra of Sankha-Likhita 
gives somewhat similar limits by remarking ' spotless spiritual 
pre-eminence is to be found ( in the country ) to the east of the 
countries of Sindhu and Sauvlra, to the west of the city of 
Kampill, to the south of Himalaya and to the north of 
Pfiriyatra \ 87 The extant Manusmrti ( II. %% ) makes Aryavarta 
ooterminos with the whole of India north of the Vindhya by 
saying that the territory between the Himalaya and the 
Vindhya and extending up to the eastern and western oceans is 
known by the wise as Aryavarta. The second view ( viz. 
Aryavarta is the region between the Ganges and the Jumna ) 
occurs in Baud. Dh. S. ( 1. 1.28 ). In the Tai. Ar. 11.20 special 
honour is shown to those who dwell between the Ganga and the 
Yamuna. The third view ( viz. Aryavarta is the country where 
the black antelope roams about naturally ) is the one given in 
most smrtis. Both Vasistha ( 1. 14-15 ) and Baud. Dh. S. ( 1. 1. 
29-30 ) quote an ancient gatha from the Nidana work of the 
Bhallavins 28 to the effect that wherever the black antelope 
roams about in the country lying between the Sindhu in the 
west and the rising mountain in the east, there is spiritual 
pre-eminence. So this view is a very ancient one and probably

disappeared and Vanaparva ( 130. 3-5 ) says that the Sarasvati 
disappeared at the entrance of NissdarSsti a through fear of pollution 
from NisBdas and Salyaparva ( 37. 1-2) tells us that Vinasana is the 
sacred place where the Sarasvati disappeared through hatred for 6u~dias 
and Abhiras.

arose from some mythological aocount as is indicated by the 
commentary of Visvarupa on Yaj. 1.2 which quotes a prose 
passage of the Svetasvataras ' Sacrifice became a black antelope 
and wandered over the earth; dharma followed it in its 
wanderings'. This view of the limits of Aryavarta is maintained 
by Sankha ( as quoted by Visvarupa on Yaj. 1. 2 ), Visnudharma- 
sutra 84.4, Manu II. 23, Yaj. I. 2, Satnvarta4, Laghu-Harlta (I. p. 
178 ), Veda-Vyasa ( I. 3 ), Brhat-ParSsara ( p. 56 ) and several 
other smrtis. The Manusmrti ( II. 17-24 ) defines Brahmavarta 
as the country between the holy rivers Saras vatl and Drsad- 
vatl, 89 says that the traditional mode of conduct observed in that 
oountry is oalled sadacdra, that the countries of Kuruksetra, 
Matsya, Paficala and Surasena are styled Brahmarsidesa 
and are slightly less ( in holiness ) than Brahmavarta, that 
Madhyadesa is between the Himalaya and the Vindhya and to 
the east of Vinasana and to the west of Prayaga, tha* 
Aryavarta is the country between the Himalaya and Vindhya 
up to the eastern and western oceans, that that territory where 
the black antelope roams about naturally is the country fit 
for sacrifices and the countries beyond constitute rrdecckadeia y 
that men of the three higher varnas should endeavour to 
live in these countries ( viz. Brahmavarta, Brahmarsidesa, 
Madhyadesa, Aryavarta &c. ) while a sudra, when distressed 
for his livelihood, may stay in any country whatever. The 
Visnudharmasutra (84. 4 ) says that the country where the 
system of the four varnas is not established is to be known as 
Mleccha country and Aryavarta is beyond that. This is ex- 
plained by Aparftrka (p. 5 ) as follows : one who desires to 
practise Vedio religion should live in one of the four countries 
viz. Brahmavarta and others ; if that is not possible, then in 
a country where there is establishment of the four varnas and 
the black antelope roams about naturally ; if both these cannot 
be had, then one should dwell in a country where at least one 
of the two (caturvarnya and black antelope) is found. The 
above discussion shows that in very ancient times the country 
south of the Vindhya was looked upon as beyond the pale of 
Aryan culture^ Baud. Dh. S. f 1. 1. 31 ) says that the countries of 
Avanti, Anga, kagadha, Surastra, Daksinapatha,Upavrt,Sindhu 



39. Vide TSndya Br. 25. 10. 13-14 for Dr^advatl falling into the

the centre of India.

and Sauvlra are of mixed origin ( i. e. not of pure Aryan 
ancestry), that a person who goes to Araftaka, Kftraskara, 
Pundra, Sauvlra, Aiiga, Vanga, Kalinga and PrRntlna ( ? ) has 
to offer a solemn sacrifice like the Sarvaprs^ha and that for 
going to Kalinga the prayascitta is an offering to Vaisvanara 
Agni. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 292 quotes a verse of Devala to the 
effect that if a man goes to Sindhu, Sauvlra, SaurSstra, the 
border lands ( or Mleccha countries ), Anga, Vanga, Kalinga 
and Andhra he has to perform the Upanayana satfaskara over 
again. 40 The Mit. adds a remark that this is so only if the man 
goes to these countries for some purpose other than pilgrimage . 
Gradually however as Aryan culture spread over the whole 
of what is now called India the view of the sages about the 
countries pre-eminently Aryan had to be given up. Medhatithi 
on Manu II. 22 explains that Aryavarta is so called ' because 
Aryas again and again spring up there and because the 
Mlecchas even if they overrun it from time to time do not abide 
there for long ' and then makes the following very sensible 
observation ( on II. 23 ) ' if a ksatriya king of excellent conduct 
were to conquer the Mlecchas, establish the system of four 
varnas ( in the Mleccha country ) and assign to Mlecchas a 
position similar to that of candalas in Aryavarta, even that 
( Mleccha ) country would be fit for the performance of sacri- 
fices, since the earth is not by itself impure, but becomes impure 
through contact ( of impure persons or things ).' 41 As a result 
of the spread of Aryan culture eastwards and southwards 
and the frequent invasions of non-Aryan tribes on the north- 
west, the countries on the rivers of the Punjab came to be looked 
upon in the whirligig of time as unworthy of the Aryas to 
live in. Karnaparva 43. 5-8 abuses those who live on the Sindhu 
and the five rivers of the Punjab as impure and dharmabahya.**

Ch. I ] Bharatavarsa Vt 

Another word which is very often used, particularly in the 
Puranas, to denote the territory where the ancient Vedio reli- 
gion prevails is Bharatavarsa or Bharatavarsa. It occurs in the 
Hathigumpha InscriptfoffoFE3iaravela ( 2nd century B. 0. ) as 
Bharadhavasa. 43 The Markandeyapurana says that Bharatavarsa 
has the ocean on the east, south and west and the Himalaya on 
the riorfla. 44 " Ite Visnupurana ( II. 3.1 ) says the same and 
Matsya ( 114-10 ) and Vayu define Bharatavarsa as stretching 
from Cape Oomorin to the source of the Ganges. 45 Sahara ( not 
later than 5th centliry A. D. ) in his bhasya on Jaimini ( X. 
1*35 and 42 ) shows that to him there was unity of language 
and culture from the Himalaya to Cape Oomorin. 48 Pai^hlnasi as 
quoted in the Paribhasa-prakasa (p. 58) says that dhaymais fully 
developed ( lit. four-legged ) in the country from the Himalaya 
to Cape Comorin. 4T â Accord ing'fty MSrkarideya ( 53-41 ), Vayu 
(vol. I chap. 33-52) and other Puranas Bharafcjayarsa is so called 
after Bharata, son of ^Siaoha, descendant of Svayambhuva Manu; 
while Vayu ( vol. II. chap. 37-130 ) appears to strike a different 
note by saying that Bharatavarsa is so called after Bharata, 
the son of Dusyanta and Sakuntala. The Visnupurana says 
that after thousands of births a person secures life as a human 
being in Bharatavarsa and this land is called Karmabhumi ( the 
land of religious actions ) for those who want to secure heaven 
and final liberation. 48 The Vayupurana says almost the same 
and adds that in no land other than Bharatavarsa is karma 
prescribed for mortals. It is somewhat amusing to find that

many of the countries of India that in modern times pride them- 
selves on being most orthodox are declared by the Aditya-purana 
( as quoted in the Smrticandrika ) to be countries unfit for 
habitation and to be such that a stay in them except for pilgrim- 
age entailed loss of caste and prayasoittas. 49 The Adipurana 
( Adityapurana ? ) as quoted in the Paribhasaprakasa ( p. 59 ) 
says ' no one, whether a dvija or not, born in Aryavarta should 
cross the three rivers, Sindhu, Karmada ( i. e. Karmanasa ) or 
Karatoya except on a pilgrimage ' and that if he does so, he 
should perform the penance of candrayana. 

All smrti writers and commentators generally restrict 
themselves to the duties of varnas and asramas as practised in 
Aryavarta or Bharatavarsa, though in very rare cases ( as in 
Yaj. II. 192 ) they provide for the observance of the usages of 
even heretics.

CHAPTER II 

VARNA 

, The number of works dealing with the origin and 
characteristics of the caste system in India is legion. Most 
of them, however, concern themselves with the detailed des- 
cription of the bewildering variety of castes and subdivisions 
of castes in modern times and their present religious and social 
customs and usages. ^The origin of caste has given rise to 
great speculation and several schools of thought have arisen. 
Generally individual authors lay undue emphasis on one 
element or attach far too much importance to one point in 
tracing the origin of the caste system and its ramifications, 
such as race ( Risley ), tribe ( Ibbetson ), occupation ( Nesfield ). 
The study of the origin and development of caste in India is 
one of deep and absorbing interest to all students of sociology. 
A complete and critical examination of the several theories 
of caste advanced by distinguished authors and a detailed 
description of the hundreds of castes and suboastes now found 
in India is far beyond the scope of the present work. v For 
those who want to make a thorough study of the most 
important works on caste a modest list is given in the footnote 
below. 50

20 History of DharmaiUstra [ Ch. II 

The caste system has been highly eulogised and also most 
severely condemned by Western writers. Sidney Low in his 
â¢Vision of India* (pp. 262-263, 2nf ed. of 1907) speaks of 
the beneficent aspect of the caste system in the following 
eloquent passage * There is no doubt that it is the main cause 
of the fundamental stability and contentment by which Indian 
society has been braced up for centuries against the shocks 
of politics and the cataclysms of Nature. It provides every 
man with his place,- his career, his occupation, his circle of 
friends. It makes him at the outset a member of a corporate 
body, it protects him through life from the canker of social 
jealousy and unfulfilled aspirations; it ensures him compa- 
nionship and a sense of community with others in like case 
with himself. The caste organization is to the Hindu his

after being in close touch with Hindus of all castes for 
15 years as a missionary, remarks ( in his work on the 
character, manners and customs of the people of India, 
translated into English and published in London in 1817 )

as the happiest effort of their legislation; and I am well 
convinced that, if the people of India never sunk into a state of 
barbarism, and if, when almost all Europe was plunged in 
that dreary gulf, India kept up her head, preserved and ex- 
tended the sciences, the arts and civilization, it is wholly 
to the distinction of castes that she is indebted for that 
high celebrity ' ( p. 14 ) and he devotes several pages to 
the justification of this remark. Maine in his ' Ancient

gays * It has been said with some truth that caste promotes cleanliness 
and order and is in a certain sense a bond of union among all classes 
of the Hindu community. Yet surely these ends might have been 
attained in a simpler manner and by a less antagonistic process. T7ie 
invention of a project so wonderfully elaborate and intricate â a project 
of bringing into absolute.subjection two hundred millions of the human 

species by robbing them of their independence, the invention of a 

project like this, so prodigious and far-reaching was not needed to 
accomplish such useful and beneficent ends. That another and very 
different object was in view from the very first is abundantly manifest. 
This object was neither more nor less than to exalt the Brahman, to 
feed his pride and to minister to his self-will.' Equally sweeping con- 
demnation can be and has been indulged in Jas regards feudalism and 
modern capitalism. Fick (p. 331) entirely scouts the idea that the theory 
of castes was invented by the priests. There are several fallacies 
lurking in the above quoted passage of Sherring. Id the first place, 
there is nothing to show that the caste system was invented by any 
body of persons who could impose their will on a continent. The 
system simply grew up in the lapse of ages. The population of Hindus 
when Sherring wrote!may have been near two hundred millions, but it 
could not have been more than a small fraction of that colossal number 
during the thousands of years that the system has flourished. Besides 
writers like Sherring pass over the great achievements of Indians under 
the caste system in Literature, religion and philosophy, in handicrafts 
and in the fine arts and unduly exaggerate the defects of the system 
that have become glaring only in the machine-made civilization of the 
19tb and 20th centuries. These critics ignore the great adaptability of 
the system, whereby it preserved Indian society from social anarchy 
during ages of foreign invasions and internecine wars. While severely 
condemning the brShmauas the critics altogether forget that the vast 
and varied Sanskrit Literature owes its production and preservation 
mostly to the sacrifice of the brShmanas wt ages. Under the caste

that the caste system was an invention, an artificial prj?jJuot, 
due to the machinations of crafty brahmanas. Every great 
institution has its extremes of good or evil". " This work will 
endeavour to steer clear of downright and hypercritical con- 
demnation of the caste system due to relying on modern stand- 
points and conditions of society and unthinking adulation 
thereof. It will try to present and balance facts and though it 
cannot help passing judgments it will leave the reader free 
to judge for himself as far as possible. In the present work the 
discussion will be mostly confined to the evidence of Sanskrit 
literary monuments, ancient and medieval. An attempt will 
be made to trace the origin of caste from Vedio times, to exhibit 
theories of the DharmasutrakSras, other smrtikaras and com- 
mentators on the subject and to describe the peculiar ceremonies, 
privileges, duties and responsibilities of Hindu castes as 
gathered from these works in Sanskrit. To discuss the feasibility 
or desirability of totally destroying the caste system or the ways 
and means of attaining that end is deemed to be outside the 
legitimate limits of this volume. It may, however, be expressly 
stated as the author's opinion, in order to avoid misunderstand- 
ings or fruitless speculations about his personal views, that he 
does not think that the caste system was an artificial product 
due to the intrigues, greed and cunning of brahmanas, nor does 
he hold that it is feasible to destroy the whole edifice of the caste 
system in the near future. In the cities we may find some 
people taking their food together but the real India is in the 
villages, where in spite of the loud denunciations of reformers 
for a hundred years, the restrictions on taking food and inter- 
oaste marriages are almost as rigid as /they once were. Our 
efforts must be directed to wide and rapid spread of literacy 
among the village people, the diffusion of the idea of one people 
and one nationality and gradual fusion of small subcastes into 
larger* similar units. We in India have no doubt reached a 
critical stage in our history when old ideals, institutions and

system, no man was allowed to be useless to the commonwealth and his 
conduct was a question of honour with his group. When all work was 
turned out with the hands, the caste system tended to preserve and 
augment the skill of artisans. Moreover what social organization is to 
be substituted and how is not made clear by these critics. Most of these 
critics have the western stfial system based on wealth and the indus- 
trial revolution in view |%ut that system also is as evil as or perhaps 
worse than the modern caste system.

habits are being shattered by the impact of new ideas and by 
the onrush of world forces. We have to decide whether we shall 
make or be able to make a clean sweep of all old ideals and 
institutions as so much debris and rubbish or whether while 
keeping the old ideals and some of the old institutions as founda- 
tions we shall build up a new social order and create and foster 
new habits of thought and action. It is beyond the scope of 
the present work to write more on this point. 

* A sort of caste system based on birth and occupation did 
prevW in many countries in ancient times as in Persia, Rome 
and Japan. But in all these countries it hardly ever made any 
near approach in rigour and complexity to the caste system that 
we have in India and instead of ramifying into divisions and 
subdivisions, it dwindled and disappeared in the course of time. 
No unanimity seems possible as to the several causes and ciroum- 
stanoes which led in India alone to the evolution of the 
stupendous structure of casteX Not only is it impossible to hold 
that the origin of the modern complexity of the oaste system is 
to be traced back to one single cause, but it is difficult to acoept 
that even all the origins that have been postulated by the 
several authors can adequately and satisfactorily explain the 
modern caste system. 

, In most of the works on the castes in India a few features 
are pointed out as the characteristics of the caste system and as 
common to all castes and sub-castes. They are : ( 1 ) heredity 
i. e, in theory a man is assigned to a particular caste by birth 
in that caste ; ( 2 ) endogamy and exogamy i. e, restriction as 
to marrying in the same caste and not marrying certain rela- 
tives or other persons, though of the same caste ; ( 3 ) restric- 
tions as to food ( i. e. what food and water may be taken or not 
taken and from whom ) ; ( 4 ) occupation ( i. e. members of most 
castes follow certain occupations and no others); (5) grada- 
tion of castes, some being at the top in the social scale and 
others being deemed to be so low that they are untouchable. 
Some authors 52 like Senarfc add another characteristic, viz. the 
caste council with its chief having in meeting assembled 
among other matters the power to regulate the conduct of its 
members, to impose the penalties of fine or excommunioation 
for lapses. It may be said at once that this last is a feature

that is not found among most of the brahmana and ksatriya 
castes even in modern times and is not dealt with by dharraa- 
sastra works. \(Elndogamy is now the most prominent characte- 
ristic of caste^ and scTTs" iEeTb eory t"hat it is by, birth/h The 
other three are more or less fluctuating from province iro pro- 
vince and age to age) In this work the first five characteristics 
of the caste system set out above will be subjected to a close 
critical examination on the basis of the Vedic and dharma- 
sastra material/ We must also remember thaFthe attributes 
of caste have hot been the same throughout th e ages. ,' There 
is great difference beTween the popular concepti6ns~"l>T 
modern caste and the conceptions liBbut it embodied in 
the~ ancient and" medieval dharmasastra works. In the 
twentieth century caste in India is a matter of marriage and 
to a much lesser extent of food arid drink. ' As to avoca- 
tions any one can at present follow any profession without 
fear of loss of caste excepting a few believed to be very impure 
and very degrading ones (like those of sweepers, butchers, 
tanners &c. ). It is also not possible even now for any one 
to be generally accepted as a priest, unless he is or claims to 
be a brahmana. NThe old barriers that separated one caste or 
subcaste from another have been greatly shaken by the influx 
of modern ideas and the exigencies of the times and one may hope 
that in a few decades more caste will remain as a purely social 
institution regulating marriages and to a lesser extent commen- 
sality ( and not a religious one ). Western scholars, in spite of 
their most commendable patience and industry, often present, 
through ignorance or lack of first-hand knowledge, the number 
of castes as larger than what it actually is. For example, 
Sherring (vol. II. Introduction pp. XXII-XLVI ) gives an 
alphabetical list of brahmanical tribes and remarks ( XL VII ) 
' Hundreds of these tribes, if not at enmity with one another, 
cherish mutual distrust and antipathy to such a degree that 
they are socially separated from one another as far as it is 
possible for them to be-as muoh as brahmanas are from the 
lowest outcastes- neither eating nor drinking together nor 
intermarrying'. The list he gives is most misleading. To take 
only a few examples, he enumerates Athavle, Achwal, Abhyan- 
kara, Apte, Agashe, Bhanu, Bivalkar, Badye, Bhide, Bhagvat, 
Bhuskute, Bhat, Bodas as separate tribes ; but it is well-known 
to people in Wester jgplndia that these are the surnames ( not 
subcastes) of the Kclikanastha or Citpavana brahmanas, who 
not only interdine, but also inter-marry among themselves,

\The word varria means * colour ' or ' light ' in most 

passages of the RgveSa' I e.' g. I. 73.7/ II. 3.5, IX. 97.15, 
IX. 104.4, IX. 105.4, X. 124.7 ). But in some verses of the 
Rgveda 53 the word varna is associated with groups of people 
having a skin of a dark or fair^ colour. For example, we 
read in Rg. II. lS.T"^ Indra) who placed low the dasa colour 
in a cave (or darkness)'; in Rg. I. 179.6 * the fierce sage 
(Agastya) cherished both varnas'; in Rg. IX. 71.2 ' like one 
( a fighter ) who strikes the people he ( Soma ) who is powerful 
goes giving out frequent roars; he exposes the Asura colour ' ; 
in T^g. I. 130.8 ' Indra helped in battles the Arya sacrificerV..... 
Indra punished for the sake of Manu ( the dasas ) who do not 
observe the ordinances and subdued ( or killed ) the dark skin '; 
(Indra having killed the dasyus protected the arya varna ' 
(T$g. III. 34.97i 'TOttf Indra) subdued for Bjisvan, the son 
of Vidathin, i ipru and powerful Mrgaya; you mowed down 
fifty thousand dark (men), you shattered cities as old age 
does shatter good looks ' Rg. IV. 16.13 ; ' Somas, which strike 
away the dark skin ' Rg. IX, 41.1. In Rg. I. 158.5 a certain 
dasa is called Traitana which name has a Persian ring about ' 
it ; In Rg. I. 104.2 varna seems to be placed in opposition to 
dasa. These passages make it clear that the Aryas and dasas 
were two opposing camyps and both were designated * varnas ' 
on account of the colour of TETeir skins. -The Tai. Br. L* 2. 6

between the art/as and dasas or dasyus is emphasized and 
prayers are offered to Indra and other gods for having subdued 
or for subduing the dasa in favour of the Arya. Rg. I. 51.8; 
I. 103.3; 1. 117.21; II. 11.2, 4, 18, 19 ; III. 29.9 ; V. 70.3 ; VII. 5.6; 
IX. 88.4 ; VI. 18.3 ; VI. 25.2. In Rg. I. 51.8 Indra is requested 
to mark who are aryas and who are dasyus. This does not 
mean that there was difference between the two in bodily 
appearance only; on the contrary the antithesis between the arya 
who is referred to as 4 barhismat ' and the dasyu who is styled 
'avrata' clearly shows that the emphasis was rather on the 
difference of their cults. That dasyu and dasa are identical in 
meaning follows from the same epithets being applied to both and 
from the fact that dasyu and dasa occur in the same verses as 
applying to the same enemy." In Rg. X. 22.8 dasyu and 
dasa are used in the same verse as applicable to the same 
enemy. In Rg. X. 99.6 and 8 Indra is represented as killing 
both dasa and dasyu respectively. The dasyus are described 
as ' avrata ' ( not obeying the ordinances of the gods ) in 
Bg. I. 51.8, L 175.3, VI. 14.3, ' akratu ' (who perform no 
sacrifice ) in VII. 6.3, 56 * mrdhravacah ' ( whose speech is in- 
distinct or soft ) in VII. 6.3 and V. 29.10, * anasaÂ£ ' ( snub-nosed 
or dumb ) in Rg. V. 29.10. It appears that dasa and dasyu 
are synonyms and were sometimes styled asuras. For 
example, Sambara is called dasyu and dasa in Rgveda VI. 31.4 
and dasa in Rg. VI. 26.5 and is also associated with 
asuras like Fipru in VI. 18.8 ; Pipru is spoken of 
as a dasa in Rg. VIII. 32.2 and as an asura in X. 138.3. 
Varcin is styled dasa in Kg. IV. 30.15 and VI. 47.21 
and asura in VII. 99.5. In Tai. S. 57 ( IV. 3.11.3 ) also it seems 
that they are held to be identical. The enmity between dasa and 
arya is breathed in such verses as the following: Rg. II. 11.4 
' vanquish the tribe of dasas by the sun ( i. e. by the help of a 
brilliant weapon ); Rg. I. 174-7 * You made the earth a pillow for 
the dasa ( i. e. you laid him low on the ground ); Rg. III. 12-6

cities that had dasas as overlords \ It is not possible to say that 
dasas or dasyus were some Aryan tribes that had fallen from 
the worship or culture of the Aryan singers of Vedic hymns. In 
many places the sage refers to the conquest for him by Indra 
and other gods of dasas as well as Aryan foes. For example, 
* Protectors of the good! you ( two ) killed Aryin foes and dasa 
foes ' Rg. VI. 60-6; 'Oh Indra and Varuna I you killed dasa foes 
and also Arya foes and helped Budas with your protection ' 
Rg. VII. 83.1. Vide also Rg. VI. 2240, X. 69-6, X. 83-1, X. 102.3. 
This shows that though the aryanshad become divided and fought 
among themselves, they keptaryas and dasas quite distinctlj^be. 
foregoing shows that in the times of the Rgveda there were two 
anTagonTs?io ^campsfof the aryas and dasas or dasyus, they 
differred in, the colour of their skins and also iu worship, speech 
and bodily appearance. Therefore, in the earliest period we find 
the word varnaassociated only with dasa an<T with arya. 
Though the words brahmana and ksafcrhra^ occur frequently in 
the Rgveda, the worfvarnTis notuseain connection with them. 
Even in the Purusasiikta ( Rgveda X. 90 ) where the words 
brahmana, rajanya, vaisya and sudra occur the word varna is 
not used. Hence, one may reasonably say that the only water- 
tight groups that are positively or expressly vouchsafed by the 
Rgveda are a^yaTand dasa ordasju. Â£It is often argued that^ as 
the word bf^mTQ^na^enotes*" a caste In la?er Ifterature,*ln the 
Rgveda aTsoirmttSt be presumed to have the same meaning. 
But this begs the whole qulÂ£lT6TEr"Ttfo one denies that brahmana 
denotes a caste in later literature.) But whether it has the same 
sense in the ftgveda musGoe determined on the materials 
furnished by the Rgveda itself. Some rely on the word ' bra- 
hmaputra ' in Rg. II. 43. 2 as showing that a brahmana became 
so only by birth in the Rgveda. But the verse begins by saying 
that ' you sing a Sama like the Udgafcr priest ' and so ' brahma- 
putra * must mean a rtvij whose duty it was to recite sastras (the 
Brfthmanacchamsin as Sayana explains ). \ It is generally 
conceded that the Purusasiikta is a much later hymn than 
mSstofthe hymns of the Rgveda. fin the whole of the Rgyeda

sukta, though both of them occur in the Atharvaveda (V. 17-9 
for vaisya ancTTV 20. -fand 8 for sudra and arya ) and very 
frequently in the Tai. S. Besides we cannot forget that the final 
redaction of the Rgveda must be held to have been separated 
from the composition of the indiviflfcil hymns by several 
hundred years ( if not more ) and that even if it be conceded 



28 History of DharmaiGstra I Oh. II 

that at the time when the Purusasukta was composed, the four 
varnas had been constituted and had become castes, yet the same 
cannot be affirmed for the time of the original composition of 
the other hymns. The word brahmana occurs several times in 
the Rgveda: 58 * Oh brahmanas, Oh pitrs fond of soma ! May the 
sinless Dyavaprfchivl ( Heaven and Earth ) tend to our welfare'; 
4 Like brahmanas in the Atiratra where soma is to bo drunk, 
utterring ( words ) round a lake full of water you have, Oh frogs, 
gathered together on that day of the year on which the rains begin 1 
( Rg. VII. 103. 7 ); 59 * The brahmanas, who drink soma, reciting 
prayers of the yearly sacrifice, have S8nt forth their speech ' 
( Rg. VII. 103. 8 ). In this verse brahmanas are expressly said 
to be getting * brahma ' ready. * May Agni who devours every- 
thing make that ( dead body ) free from disease and ( may ) 
soma also ( do the same ) who entered into the brahmanas ' ( Rg. 
X. 16. 6 ). * When the br&hmanas worship together as friends 
in hymns ( lit. speed of the mind ) that are fabricated from their 
hearts' ( Rg. X. 71. 8). In Rg. VI. 75. 10 brahmanas are 
invoked for welfare along with pitrs. This shows that the 
brahmanas were highly venerated. The other verses establish 
that they were the reciters of hymns ( brahma ) and drank soma. 
In "Rg. VIII. 35. 16-18 we read * You ( Aivins ) urge on (or 
inspire ) brahma, you urge on our thoughts ( or actions ), you 
kill the evil spirits and subdue diseases ; ( 17 ) you urge ksatra 
(valour) and also men, you kill evil spirits (same as 16 ) ; 
( 18 ) you urge on the cows and also the Vis ( the rest is same 
as 16 ).' ., Here it seems that the groups of people ( viz. those 
who think and make song*?, those who show valour and lead 
men, and those common people who tend cattle ) are clearly 
meant. These verses may be conceded as pointing to the exis- 
tence of three groups (brahmanas, ksatriyas and vis ah ) but 
there is nothing in them to show that these three had crystal- 
lised into somewhat like tho castes of later times. In Ijfcg. VII. 
33. 11 Vasistha is addressed as brahman, but that does not 
mean that he was a brahmana ( by birth ), as he is said to have 
been born of UrvasI from Mifcra and Varuna. Similarly, in

Rg. IX. 96. 6 ( Brahma devanam ) the word brahma 60 does not 
certainly mean ' brahmana by birth \ nor does ' vipranam ' 
mean ' brahmanas by birth \ In that verse oae who is super- 
eminent among a group is specified, just as the buffalo among 
animals, the hawk among carnivorous birds &c. In Rg. VIII. 33. 
19 ' look down and not up; bring your feet close together ; may 
thy kasaplakas ( legs ? ) be not seen, for though a brahma, thou 
wert born a woman,' it is impossible to hold that the last words 
mean * thou wert a brahmana woman \ If it is only intended 
to refer to the fact that she is a brahmana woman, there is no 
reason why the Perfect tense ( babhuvitha ) is used and not the 
present. Here ' brahma ' most probably means ' a priest of that 
name \ as that is the meaning in Rg. II. I. 2 ( brahma casi 
grhapatis-ca no dame). The word ' brahmajaya ' in Rg. X. 
109. 2, 3, 6 and 7 does not mean the wife of a brahmana by 
birth but rather ' wife of Brhaspati \ The whole hymn is 
obscure and more or less enigmatic or allegorical. In the 
Aitareya-brahmana 61 35. 2-4 it is said that soma is the food 
of brahmanas and that a ksatriya was to press the tendrils of 
the Nyagrodha tree and the fruits of Udumbara, Asvattha and 
Plak^a and drink the juice so pressed instead of soma. - v It^ 
appears, therefore, that the brahmanas were a distinct group 
even in the 'earliest period of the. Bgyeda. Whether they were 
hereditary is certainly not clear ; nor is there anything to show 
that there were restrictions as regards partaking of food from 
persons other than brahmanas of as to marriage. That brahmanas 
in the Rgveda were a class by themselves may be conceded, 
but whether they had become a^sfeTByTliriiK is" a ^matter of 
opinion dependent on the connotation given to the word caste. 
Dr. Ghurye ( * Caste and race in India ' p. 42 ) thinks, probably 
following the Vedic Index ( vol. I on Ksatriya ), that the 
reference in Rg. X. 71. 9 to a false claim for being regarded

being ignorant and having resorted to speech in sinful ( or 
coarse ) language take to ploughshares and engage in ( agri- 
cultural) operations'. It is difficult to see how there is here 
any false claim to be regarded as a brahma na. This verse 
means apparently that those who are not composers of prayers 
or drinkers of soma ( because they are ignorant ) are men of 
low speech and have to turn to agriculture. Even in the days 
of the dharma-sutras restrictions as to food and marriage 
for brahmanas were not at all as rigid as tbey became in 
medieval and modern times ; but even when these restrictions 
were not rigid it was clearly laid down that aÂ°*brahmana is 
so by birth alone. V,The word ' brahma * generally means in 
the Rgveda 1 prayer' or"* Hynm". Vfde * % IV. 6.11, Vl. 52.2, 
X 105.8, X. 141.5 (*Oli AgnCmake our prayer and sacrifice 
prosper by your flames'). Rg. III. 53.12 is 'this brahma 
( prayer or spiritual power ) of Visvamitra protects the Bharata 
people'. In the Atharvaveda II. 15.4 (as brahma and ksatra 
entertain rio fear, nor are they"" li armed ) brahrna seems to 
mean ' the class of brahmanas \ The transition of meaning 
from 'brahma' (prayer) to brahma' meaning the class of 
those who composed or recited prayers is natural and easy. In 
the Rgveda I. 157.2 both'^rahi'na and ksatra occur 63 in the 
same verse where they probably mean ' prayer ' and ' valour ' 
respectively. In the Atharvaveda III. 19. 1 both words occur and 
probably mean the same thing as in Bg. I. 157.2. In some Vedic 
works brahma and ksatra aland collectively for brahmanas 64 and 
ksatriyas (e. g. Tai. Br. II. 7.18, Br. Up. I. 4.11, Kathopanisad 
I. 2. 24 ). The word ksatriya is very frequently applied as an 
epithet to several gods; e. g. Rg7 VII: 64. 2 and VIII. 25. 8 
( in both to Mitra and Varuna ), Rg. VIII. 67. 1 ( to Adityas ), 
Bg. X. 66.8 ( to gods in general ). In some verses ksatrjya 
means ' a king or a nobleman '; e. g. 3$g. IV. 42.1 f the kingdom 
on both sides ( heaven and" earth ) belongs to me, who am a 
ksatriya and who holds sway over all living persons, so that 
all the immortals ( gods ) are ours (on my side)'; 65 Rg. X. 109.3

( âAtharva V. 17.3 ) 'the domain of the ksatriya has been 
protected ( from the sight of enemies ) \ (The word ' rSjanya

the sense of ksatriya in the AtEarvaVeda V." 17.9. T?Fe liame 
remark applies ToTEeT word* ksatriya as to brahmana. It is 
difficult to say whether ksatriyas were so by birth iu the 
times of the hymns of the Kg. or were only a class more or 
less fluid. We find that the Rg. speaks " of Devapi as the 
purohita of Santanu who became a king. The story 86 is that 
both were sons of ftstiseria and that Santanu, though a younger 
brother, became king as Devapi was not willing to be a king. 
The result was a famine due to Santanu's transgression and 
so Devapi performed a sacrifice to induce rainfall. This shows 
that out of two brothers one became a king and the other a 
purohita. So kings and purohitas did not depend on birth. 
In Rg. IX. 112. 3 a poet exclaims ' I am a reciter of hymns 
my father is a physician and my mother grinds ( corn ) 
with stones. We desire to obtain wealth in various actions. * 67 
In Bg. III. 44-5 the poet wistfully asks Indra ' 0, Indra, 
fond of soma, would you make me the protector of people, 
or would you make me a king, would you make me a 
sage, that has drunk of soma, would you impart to me 
endless wealth ? * This shows that the same man could be 
a rsi or a noble or a king. Dr. Ghurye ( in * Caste and 
race in India * p. 44 ) thinks that the ksatriyas had become 
a compact body and he particularly relies on Rg. VII. 104. 13 
( = Atharvaveda VIII. 4. 13 ) which is cited in the Vedio 
Index ( vol. 1, p. 207 ) for the same purpose. That verse literally 
means ' Soma does not urge on the crooked one, nor the ksatriya 
who bears false. He strikes the raksas, and strikes him who 
speaks falsely ; both lie in the bonds of Indra'. The words 
' ksatriyam mithuya dharayantam ' are explained by Sayana as 
' Ksatriya who bears false words'. The 2nd half is only an 
expansion of the first half and so 'vrjina' corresponds to 
' raksas ' and * asad vadantam ' is only a paraphrase of ' mithuya 
dharayantam'. They may mean this that one who is a 
ksatriya, but has no strength as a ksatriya should have, is at

the morcy of Indra. Unless we project; our notions of the later 
state of society and the caste system when considering this verse, 
it is hardly possible to hold that this verse indicates that it 
refers to persons making a false claim for entrance into a com- 
pact body of ksatriyas by birth. Dr. Ghurye also says ( p. 44 ) 
* The 2nd order in society, the ksafcriya, is known in the earlier 
portions of the Rgveda as rajanya.' I have not; been able to find 
the word rajanya in the Rgveda any where except in the Purusa- 
sukfca. In the Aitareya biahmana (chap. 34. 2) the word 'rajanya* 
stands for a member of the 2nd class in society, while ksatriya 
means a king of whom land ( for sacrifice to gods ) is asked for 
by brahmana, rajanya or vaisya, 

\ Though the word vaisya occurs in the Â£gvÂ§4*L on ly 
in * the Purusasiikta, the word * vis ' is very frequently 
jemployed in it. It generally means * people or _ group of 
people \ In a large number of cases we have the words 
rnaniisir-visah or manuslsu viksu or manuslnam visam, e. g. 
Rg. I1I.5.3, LII.6.3, III. 11. 5 (invincible Agni goes in front of 
human groups ), IV. 6. 7 and 8, IV. 9. 2, V. 1. 9, V. 8. 3, VI. 48. 
8, VI. 47. 16 ( viso manusyau ), X. I. 4, X 69. 9. In some places 
we have ' dasir visah * ( the dasa hordes ) e. g. IV. 28-4, VI. 25-2. 
In 68 Rg. III. 34-2 we have * Oh Indra, you are the leader of 
human hordes as well as of divine hordes * ( where we have 
daivlnam visam). Rg. 69 VIII. 63*7 (when loud invocations 
were sent towards Indira by the people consisting of five groups) 
shows that * vis ' means all the Aryan people . In Rg. V. 32. 11 
Indra is styled ' pancajanya ' ( favourable to the five people ) and 
in IX. 66. 20 Agni has the appellation * pancajanyah purohitafr ' 
( the puroMta of the five peoples). Sometimes jana and vis seem 
to be contradistinguished as in Rg. II. 26. 3 ( sa ij-janena sa visa 
sa janmana sa putrair-vajam bharate dhana nrbhih ), But the 
very fact that vis is qualified also as pancajanya shows that

there was hardly any distinction between jana and vil In the 
Rgveda frequent reference is made to five people ( pafica janah ); 
vide Rg. III. 37. 9, III. 59. 7, VI. 1 1. 4, VIII. 32. 22, X. 65. 23, X. 
45. 6. In the same way the words krsti (II. 2. 10, IV. 38. 10), ksifci 
( V. 35. 2, VI. 48. 7, VII. 75. 4 ), carsani ( V. 86. 2, VII. 15. 2 ) are 
employed along with panca. We have also ' pancajanyasu 
krstisu * in "frg. III. 53-16. So it is clear that vis cannot in almost 
all hymns of the Rg. mean ' vaisya ' but means the ' people ' or 
4 aryan people * when no epithet like * daslh * or * daivlh * is 
prefixed. 70 The Ait. Br. (I. 26 ) says that ' visah * means 
' rastrani * ( countries ) when explaining TJg. IV. 50-8 ( tasmai 
vi6ah svayam-3vanamante ). 

The word * dasa ' in later literature means * a serf or a 
slave.' It follows that the dasa tribe3 that we see opposed to 
the Aryas in fche Tlgveda were gradually vanquished and were 
then made to serve the Aryas. In the Manusmrti ( VIII. 413 ) 
the &udra is said to have been created by God for service 
( dasya ) of the brahraana. 7I We find in the Tai. S., the Tai. Br. 
and other Brahmana works that the sudra occupies the same 
position that he does in the smrfcis. Therefore it is reasonable 
to infer that the dasas or dasyus conquered by the Aryas were 
gradually transformed into the ^udras. From being enemies 
they were brought into friendly relations and given a very 
subordinate position. Traces are visible even in the Rgveda that 
friendly relations had begun to be established between certain 
dasas and the priests. For example in Rg. VIII. 46. 32 we read 
' the singer took a hundred ( cows or other gifts ) from the dasa 
Balbiitha and frou Taruksa.* In the Purusasukta ( X. 90. 12 ) 
the brahmana, ksatriya, vaiSya and sudra are said to have 
sprung from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet of the supreme 
Purusa. In the very next verse the sun and the moon are said 
to have been born from the eye and mind of the Purusa. This 
shows that the composer of the hymn regarded the division of 
society into four classes to be very ancient and to be as natural 
and God-ordained as the sun and the moon. 

V We shall now see what position was assigned to the sud ra 
in the Vedic Samhitas and Brahmanas. In the Rgveda the 
Arya is contradistinguished from the men ' of dark skin.' In 
the dharmasutras we find the Madras spoken of as Jdark varna. 1

Vide Ap. Dh. S. L 9. 27. 11 which is the same as Baud. Dh. S. 
II. 1. 59. 78 ^The Â£udra among men and the horse among beasts. 
Therefore those two, the horse and the sudra, are the convey-' 
ances of beings ; therefore the siidra is not fit ( or ordained ) 
for sacrifice ' ( Tai. S. VII. 1. 1. 6 ). n This shows that the 
6udra could not perforin the Vedic sacrifices and jbhat he was 
employed for carry ing^ persons In a palanquin or otherwise. 
In Tai. S. V. 7. 6. 3-4 we have ' put light ( glory ) in our 
brfihmanas, put it in our chiefs ( or kings ), ( put ) light in 
vaisyas and 6udras, put light in me by your light.* 74 This is a sure 
indication that the 6udra who took the place of the dasa is here 
placed on the same level with the other three classes in the 
matter of the receipt of light from God and that far from being 
looked upon as an enemy, he had come to be looked upon as a 
member of the society ( though the lowest in the scale ). V The 
6udra is^a moving burial ground ; therefore one should not study 
the Veda in the vicinity of a siudrar- 75 ' He created the brah- 
mana with Gayatrl, the rajanya~wTfjT Tristubh and the vaisya 
with JagatI jjbut he did not create the sudra'with any metre. 76 
The Tandy amahabrahmana says ^ 'Therefore a sudra, though he 
may have many beasts, is not entitled to perform sacrifice, he 
is godless as no deity was created after him ( as in the case 
of the other varnas ) ; therefore he does not go beyond 
washing the feet ( of the three other varnas ), since he was 
created from the feet* (this last being an allusion to the 
Purusasukta X. 90. 12 padbhyam sadro ajayata ). This shows 
that the sudra, however rich in cattle he might be, had to 
perform the menial duty of washing the feet of dvijas. The

Satapatha Br. says that * the sudra is untruth ' ( S. B. E. 
vol. 44. p. 446 ), that ' the sudra is toil ' ( S. R E. vol. 44 p. 410 ), 
and that a dlksita ( one who was initiated for a Vedic sacrifice ) 
was not to speak with a sudra ( S. B. E, vol. 26 p. 4 ). The 
Aitareya Brahmana remarks that ' the sudra 78 is at the beck 
aruTcaTI of 6the7s~tthe three' varnasVfre can ^Balnade to rise 
at Will, he'c1OT5^eaten at will.* When the father of Sunahsepa 79 
(who had sold SunahsepaT for 100 coins and had shown 
himself ready to kill him as a pasu for another hundred coins ) 
urged his son to come back to him after the boy had been 
taken into favour by Varuna and Visvamitra, he contemptu- 
ously discards his father's proposal with the words * one who 
commits an evil deed once may commit another sinful deed 
thereafter ; you did not leave aside the sudra's line of conduct ; 
you did what leaves no door for reconciliation. ' These passages 
show that the sudra, though he had ceased to bean enemy of 
the arya and had been allowed to be within tBePpale of 
society, was looked 3own upon, wa_s -assigiteli *" a ' very'low 
position, had to perform wttfk oT toil as a menial and was not 
allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. A clear line of demarca- 
tion was kept between ilie^Xrya and the Sudra in tho times of 
the BrShmana works and even in tho dharmasutras. The 
Tandya Brahmana 80 speaks of a mock fight 'the sudra and 
arya fight on a hide, out of the two they so arrange that the 
arya colour becomes the victor \ The Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 1.3.40-41 
says 81 that a brahmaoarin, if he cannot himself eat all the 
food he has brought by begging, may keep it near an arya 
( for his use ) or he may give it to a sudra who is a dasa ( of 
his teacher)'. The same Dharmasufcra 88 (II. 2.3. land 4) 
says * Aryas who are pure ( by bach ) should prepare the food 

for Vaisvadeva; or sudras supervised by aryas should 

prepare it \ Similarly Gautama X. 69 uses the word * anarya 
for sudra and Gautama 12.3 prescribes heavy punishment for a 



frazil Â§. *r. 33. 5. The legend of Sunahsepa is referred to even in Rg,

sudra having sexual intercourse wifc'i an arya woman. Jaimini 
in his Purvamlmansa sutra (VI. 1.25-38 ) establishes after 
elaborate discussion that the sudra has no adhikara for the 
performance of Agnihotra and Vedic sacrifices. It is, however, 
somewhat gratifying to find that at least one acarya, Badari, 
espoused the cause of the sudra and propounded the view that 
all ( including sudras ) were entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices 
(VI. 1.27). In the Vedanta-sutras also (I. 3.34-38) it is 
established that the sudra has no adhikara for brahmavidya based 
on Veda study, though some sudras like Vidura might have been 
endowed with the knowledge of brahma owing to sarhskaras of 
former births. In the smrti literature, however, a few passages 
are found allowing marriages of aryas with sudra women 
( which will be discussed later on ). Similarly sexual relations 
( illicit ) between a sudra woman and a man of higher 
varna are alluded to even in the Samhitas e. g. Tai. S. 82 
VII. 4.19.3 * when a sudra woman has an arya as her paramour 
Sll2 dc?r ^Â°fc Â£3ek wealth for the prosperity ( of her relations ) \ 
In Ait. Br. (8. 1) therVis the Â«tory or Kavasa Ailusa, who 
was driven out from the sacrifice on the SarasvatI with the 
words 'Oh, son 'of a female slave, you are a rogue and not a 
brahmana ; how did you take the diksa ( initiation ) as one of 
us ' and they carried him off to a sandy desert with the idea 
that he might die of thirst there. He when tormented by 
thirst ' saw ' the hymn #g. X. 30 and SarasvatI came rushing 
to him. 84 Further discussion about the sudra and his dis- 
abilities will follow in another section later. 

The position of the three varnas inter so ( called collectively 
arya ) now requires consideration. It is clear that the Samhitas 
other than the Rgveda and Brahmana works show that the three 
classes of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas had become differ- 
entiated and their privileges, duties and liabilities had become 
more or less fixed in those times. ,.

84. A similar story is told in the SSnkhSyana Br&hmapa XII. 3.

Ch. II ] Varna : brahmanas 37 

In Rg. IV. 50.8 we read ' that king alone who places brahraa 
first ( i. e. honours him ) dwells happy in his house, for him the 
earth always remains prosperous and fco him all the people ( or 
kingdoms ) bow down of their own accord \ * Brahmanas 8S are 
gods that are directly seen * ( Tai. S. I. 7. 3. 1 ); * there are two 
kinds of gods ; for indeed the gods are gods and the brahmanas 
who have studied and teach the sacred lore are the human gods' 
Sat. Br. ( S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 309, vol. 26 p. 341 ). ; In the 
Atharvaveda V. 17. 19 there is an assertion of the pre-eminence 
of brahmanas and the consequences of harming them or t^eir 
cows/ * Therefore the brahmana is the foremost ' ( Tai. S. II. 
6. 2. 5, V. 2. 7. 1 ). * Therefore the brahmana shows his might by 
his mouth, since he was created from the mouths ( Tandy a Br. 
XI. 1. 2 ). 86 In the kit. Br. ( 33. 4 ) Varuna, when he was told 
that a brahmana boy would be offered in place of the son of the 
king Hariscandra, is made to say ' a brahmana is indeed pre- 
ferable to a ksatriya \ The mere fact of birth as brShmana's 
son is represented here as giving to the boy pre-eminence over a 
king's son. On the other hand the Sat. Br. says (V. 1. 1 . 
12 ) * a brahmana 87 is not adequate to ( competent to manage ) a 
kingdom \ In the Tai. Br. it is said that playing on the vlna 
( in the Asvamedha ) is to be done by a brahmana and a rajanya 
( and not by two brahmanas ), since wealth does not find delight 
in the brahmana. ( The Satapatha Brahmana 88 ( XL 5. 7. 1 )lays 
emphasis on the fou^-peou-Har attributes of brahmanas viz. 
brahmanya ( purity of parentage as a Brahmana ), pratirupacarya 
( befitting deportment or conduct ), yasas_( &]ory ) and lokapakti 
( the teaching or perfecting of people ). * When_ the people are 
being perfected or taught by him, people endow him with four 
privileges viz. area ( honour ), dana ( gifts ), ajyeyata ( freedom

from being harassed ) and avadhyats ( freedom from being 
beaten ). The Satapatha (V. 4. 6. 9 ) expressly mentions 
that brfthmana, rajanya, vaisya and sudra are the four 
varnas. Teaching had become so much associated with the 
brahmanas that when the brahmana GSrgya approached king 
Ajatasatru for the knowledge of brahma, the latter replied " this 
is contrary to the natural order that a brahmana should approach 
a ksatriya with the idea ' he ( ksatriya ) will propound to me 
brahma \ " In a separate section below all the privileges 
enjoyed by the brahmanas will be set out at one place. 89

he speaks to tho brahmana first is really tantamount to speaking 
first to One-self; when he speaks away from the brahmana (i. e. he 
speaks to the non-brahmana first and then to the brahmana ) that is 
really speaking away to oneself ; therefore a brahmana should not be 
spoken away ( i. e postponed to non-bra~hmanas ).* Manu VIII. 24 says 
that a king should take up the causes of litigants in the order of the 
varnas (i. e. if there are two plaintiffs coming with complaints at the 
same time the brahniana's complaint should be first attended to ). 
Brhaspati says the same thing. Therefore the Tai. S. should be inter- 
preted in the same way. Another meaning is possible viz. if a brahmana 
and a non-brahmana come to a person and ask him who is superior, 
the person should declare that the brahmana is the superior of tho two 
(on account of his birth as brahmana probably or of his being a learned 
man). This sense of *adhi' as meaning 'superior * is found in Manu 
I. 99 ' since brahmana when born becomes ( or is born ) superior 
(to all) on this wide earth. 7 Prof. Keith in his translation of Tai. S. 
(Harvard Oriental Series, yoI. 18 p. 203) says in a footnote " it is not 
absolutely certain that adhibru means ' decide in favour of rather than 
4 speak in favour of." Vide also Vedic Index ( II. p. 83 ). Dr. Ghurye 
( in * Caste and race in India ' p. 43 ) says * in a legal dispute between 
a brahmana or non-brahmana an arbitrator or witness must speak in 
favour of the former. 7 It appears that Dr. Ghurye simply follows the 
rather guardedly expressed view of the famous Professor, but makes 
the sense more emphatic than Prof. Keith puts it and does not think for 
himself whether any other meaning is possible or more appropriate. Any 
stick is good for beating the brahmana with. The brahmanas were 
never ashamed in the smiti texts of declaring the privileges they

Ch. II ] Varrta : ksatriyas 39 

The position of ksatriyas and their relation to the brah- 
manas falls to be considered now. First of all with reference 
to the king several important passa^esjmay be cited. In some 
cases * rajan ' means only * a noble ' or * cEeFTas in Rg. X. 42. 
10, X. 97. 6. In many ' paSSSgeiT* rajan^ means 'king \ The 
government often seems to have â been triBalT such tribes as 
Yadus, Turvasas, Druhyus, Anus and Purus ( Rg. I. 108. 8) 
being frequently mentioned ( vide Rg. VII. 18. 6 for Bhrgus and 
Druhyus and VIL 18, 7 for Trfcsus, VIII. 6. 46 for Yadvas ). 
Whether kingship was by election it is not necessary here to 
discuss. The king was regarded as keeping the people within 
bounds. 90 , When a king was crowned, it was thought that 
'a ksatriya was produced, a lord of all beingsr the defender 
of brShmanas (or of Tioly tetfcs ) and of dharma.* 91 The 
Sat. Br. Says ' for these two ( srotriya and king ) are the 
upholders of the sacred law among men ' ( S. B. E. vol. 41 
p. 106 ). 98 That the co-operation between brahmana and ksatriya 
results in glory and success is frequently emphasized e. g. 
* therefore a brahmana must certainly be approached by a 
ksatriya who is about to perform some act, for indeed that act 
of a ksatriya which is sped on by brahmana succeeds ' 
( Satapatha, S. B. E. vol. 26 pp. 270-271 ) 93 . The purohita of a

claimed. But thoy never claimed to be treated in a court of law as 
above truth and justice. If they had taken the Tai. S. passage in the 
sense in which Dr. Ghurye takes it they would never have scrupled to 
say so in sniiti works nnd would have quoted the Tai. S. in support, 
llence the meaning is different. There is no question here of an 
arbitration or judicial decision. In JJg. I. 100. 19 there is a similar 
expression * May Indra speak in uur favour on all days * (fifa*l%*5t 
3*P*3lfÂ»r *Tt 3^g ). Vide Rg. X. 63. 11 and Va*j. S. 16. 5 for the verb

ksatriya came to occupy a very high position. The Satapatha 
(S. B. B. vol. 26 p, 270) lays emphasis on the importance 
of the purohita and cautions a brahmana against being the 
purohita of any king he meets with and adds that a brahmana 
may remain without a king, but a king should not be without 
a brahmana. Even the gods required a purohita, as the Tai. S. 
II. 5. 1. 1. says ' Visvarupa son of Tvastr was the purohita of 
gods/ 94 Sanda and Amarka were the purohitas of the Asuras 
( Kathaka S. IV. 4 ). Agni is often called purohita ( Rg. I. 
1. 1., I. 44. 10, III. 2. 8 ). ' May we, purohitas, be awake in the 
kingdom ( for its welfare ) ' says the Tai. S. ( I. 7. 10. 1 ). The 
Ait. Br. ( chap. 34. 8 ) says 95 * the purohita is half the soul of the 
ksatriya * and contains an eulogy of purohita in the following 
words ( 40. 1 ) " for indeed the gods do not eat the food of a king 
who has no purohita ; therefore a king when about to offer 
a sacrifice should have a brahmana as his purohita with the 
idea ' may the gods eat my food.' " The combination of the 
brahmana and the rajanya is said to Tbte most desirable and that 
it is conducive to the^pinence of both is declared in the Tai. S. 
( V. 1. 10. 3 ) 96 * Therefore a brahmana who is supported by a 
r&janya is superior to another brahmana ( not so supported ), 
hence a rajanya who has a brahmana ( to help him ) is superior 
to another rajanya \ The Satapatha ( V. 4. 4. 15 ) declares 'that 
king indeed who is not powerful to the brahmanas ( i. e. who is 
humble before the brahmanas ) becomes more powerful than his 
foes/ 97 It is not to be supposed that this attainment of the 
supreme position by brahmanas was an affair of plain sailing. 
Sometimes ksatriyas claimed higher position and also paid scant 
respect to brahmanas. In the Satapatha we read ' whence the 
brahmana is an object of respect after the king * ( S. B. E. vol. 41, 
p. 96 ); ' hence the people here serve, from a lower po-ition, the 
ksatriya seated above them ' Satapatha ( S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 94 ); 
'hence when a nobleman approaches, all these people, the subjects 
crouch down by him on the ground ' Satapatha ( S, B. E. vol. 26 
p. 228); 'therefore there is nothing higher than the ksatra;

therefore the brahmana sits down below the k^atriya in the 
Rsjasuya ' ( Satapatha 14. 4. 1. 23 = Br. Up. I. 4. 11). In the 
Atharvaveda several verses occur which declare the harm that 
results from disrespecting or injuring a brahmana or from rob- 
bing him of his cow. ' He who regards brahmana as food drinks 
of the poison of Tairaafca ; he who injures a brahmana, the rela* 
tive of the gods, does not attain to the world of pitrs ' ( Atharva- 
veda V. 18. 4 and 13 ). * Those who spat on a brahmana or those 
who sent to him mucus remain biting the hair in the midst of a 
stream by their mouth ; that kingdom sinks as water sinks a 
shattered vessel, where' they injure a brahmana; that wicked 
act strikes that; kingdom 98 ( Atharvaveda V. 19. 3 and 8 ). 

The stories of king Kartavlrya and Visvamitra who respec- 
tively carried off the cows of Jamadagni and Vasistha narrated 
in the Mahabharata ( Santi 49 for Kartavlrya ; â¢ Adi. 175 for 
Visvamitra ) and the Puranas show how several kings were 
high-handed and treated brahmanas with no respect whatever. It 
appears that even the wives of brahmanas wre not quite safe 
at the hands of kings. ' The chamberlain ( ksatr ) of that king in 
whose kingdom the wife of a brahmana' is thoughtlessly put 
under restraint does not march in front of cooking vessels with 
a golden ornament on his neck * " ( Atharva V. 17. 14 ). The 
somewhat mystical hymn ( Rg. X. 109 ) where ' brahmaj&ya ' 
figures prominently probably hints at the same fact ( viz. the 
kidnapping of the wives of brahmanas ). 

The Tai. S. says that ' the vjfi|y^^njdeed sacrifices, being 
desirous of cattle * and that the gods having been defeated were 
reduced to the condition of being the vaisyas or Vis of asuraa*; ,0 Â° 
' the vaisya among men, cows among beasts, therefore they are 
to be enjoyed (to be eaten, to be subsisted upon ) by others; they 
were produced from the receptacle of food ; therefore they exceed 
others in numbers'. 101 The Tai. Br. says 'the vaisya class is

said to have been born from rk verses, they declare the Yajur- 
veda as the origin of the ksatriya, the Samaveda is indeed the 
source of brahmanas \ 108 The same Br&hmana further says ' the 
vis go away from (reside separately from) the brahmanas 
and ksatriyas \ The Tandya Br. says 108 ' Hence the vaisya, 
though being eaten ( i. e. subsisted upon ) by others is not 
exhausted, since he was created from the prajanana ( from the 
sexual parts of Prajapati ) ; theref ore he has numerous cattle, he 
has all the gods ( as his patrons ) and was produced with the 
JagatI metre, his season is the rains, therefore he is to be eaten 
by the brahmana and the rajanya, since he was created as 
lower (than those two classes)*. The Sat. Br. ( S. B. E. 
vol. 26 p. 335 ) says ' He thus assigns to the Maruts a share 
therein after Indra, whereby he makes the people ( vis ) subser- 
vient and obedient to the nobility V 04 According to the Ait. Br. 
35. 3 the vaisya is one who is the food of others, who pays 
taxes to others. These passages show that vai&yas were entitled 
to sacrifice, reared cattle, were far more numerous than the 
other two classes, they had to bear the brunt of taxation, 
they lived apart from brahmanas and ksatriyas and were 
obedient to them. 

The system of the four varnas had taken such deep roots 
in the period when the Brahmana works were composed, that 
we often meet with Vedic passages saying that it extended 
even to the gods, Agni and Brhaspati being the brahmanas 
among gods; Indra, Varuna, Soma, Yama being the ksatriyas; 
Vasus, Rudras, the Visve Devas and Maruts being the vis, 
and Pusan being the sudra. 105 Similarly it is said * the 
brahmana is really spring, the ksatriya summer, and the vis 
are the rainy season.'

Ch. II ] Varna : various crafts in (he Vedas 43 

That there were other professions and crafts with specific 
names ( which in later times at lease became castes ) even in the 
times of the Sarhhitas is quite clear. The Rg. speaks of vapta 
( barber ) in X. 142.4, tasta ( a carpenter or maker of chariots ) 
in Rg. I. 61.4, VII. 32.20, IX. 112.1, X. 119.5; tvasta (a 
carpenter ) in VIII. 102.8; bhisak ( medicine man ) in IX. 112.1 
and 3, karmara or karmara ( iron-smith ) in X. 72.2 and 
IX. 112.2, carmamna ( tanner ) in Rg. VIII. 5.38. 

The Atharvaveda mentions rathakSra ( III. 5.6 ), karmara 
(III. 5.6) and suta ( III. 5.7 ). In the Tai. S. ( IV. 5.4.2 ) 106 
mention is made of ksatr ( royal chamberlain or doorkeeper ), 
sarhgrahltr ( treasurer ), taksan ( carpenter ) and rathak&ra 
( maker of chariots), kulala (potter), karmara, punjista (fowler), 
nisiada, isukrt ( maker of arrows ), dhauvakrt ( maker of bows ), 
mrgayu ( hunter ) and 6vani ( those who lead packs of hounds ). 
These also occur in the Vajasaneya-sarhhita 16. 26-28 and these 
and a few more in Vaj. S. 30.5-13 and in Kathaka Samhitft 17.13. 
In the Tai. Br. ( III. 4.1 and the following anuvakas that deal 
with Purusamedha) we have ayogu, magadha (bard), sula, 
6ailusa ( actor ), rebha, bhlmala, rathakara, taksan, kaulala, 
karmara, manikara, vapa (sower or barber), isukara, dhanvakara, 
jyakara { maker of bow-string ), rajjusarga, mrgayu, &vani 
surSkara (vintner), ayastapa (heater of iron or copper), kitava 
( gambler ), bidalakara ( worker in wicker-work ), kantakakara. 
The Satapatha Br. XI. 8.1. speaks of kaulala-cakra ( the 
potter's wheel ). The Tai. Br. III. 8.5. mentions also rajaputra 
* ugra. The Satapatha (S. B. E. Vol. 44 p. 397) speaks of Marutta 
Aviksita as an ayogava king. This latter is a pratiloma 
caste according to the dharmasutras ( vide below ). Whether 
in the Satapatha that word has the same sense is doubtful. 
The Tai. S. I. 8.9.1-2 mentions among the ' ratnas ' ( the jewels ), 
the suta, gramanl, ksatr, sarhgrahltr, bhagadugha ( collector of 
taxes ), aksavapa ( superintendent of gambling ). Vide also Tai. 
Br. I. 7.3. In the Tandya Brahmana ( 19.1.4 ) it is said that 
* eight brave persons hold up the kingdom viz. the king's 
brother, the king's son, the purohita, the crowned queen, the 
suta, the gramanl, ksatr and sarhgrahltr \ Therefore it looks 
likely that ksatr and sarhgrahltr were high officers of state 
and not castes. In the Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 1. 5 among the

guards of the horse lei; loose in the Advamedha there were * a 
hundred sons of ksStra-samgrabltrs carrying clubs \ As the 
word 'ksatra* is prefixed to * samgrahltr ' it follows that 
' sarhgrabltrs ' were officers who may have belonged to any 
varna. In the same passage mention is made of a hundred 
guardians who were the sons of siitagramarjLts. In another 
passage of the same brahmana ( XIII. 2. 2, 18) the sutas and 
gramanls are said to be no kings and yet are rajakrt ( i, e. 
king-makers ). 107 This means probably that they are the 
principal persons on whose support the king depends. The 
Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 15-19 arranges brahmana, king, king's brother, 
suta or sthapati, gramanl, sajftta in a descending scale of 
powerfulness. So the suta appears to have been originally 
an important officer. It is hardly possible to say with 
assurance that all these had become petrified into castes in the 
modern sense, particularly when several persons associated 
with these in the Vaj. S. and elsewhere were not castes such as 
the thief ( taskara ), the impotent ( kllba ), humpbacked ( kubja ) , 
dwarf ( vamana ) ; but most of the avocations and crafts 
referred to above have corresponding castes and subcastes for 
hundreds of years. It is therefore possible to say that in the 
times of the Samhifcfis and Brahmanas these were groups 
founded on occupations that had become castes or were in 
process of developing into castes. The Tandya Br. speaks 
of Kiratas ( who were and are non- Aryan and were abori- 
ginal tribes ). ,08 The Vaj. S. ( 30. 17 ) speaks of Paulkasa 
in connection with blbhatsa ( nauseating filth ) and of candala 
( in 30.21 ) in connection with vayu ( wind ). The paulkasa 
and candala occur in Tai. Br. ( III- 4. 14 and III 4. 17 
(respectively). In the Chandogya Up. ( V. 10.7 ) m the candala is 
ranked with the dog and the boar. * Therefore even if one 
knowing thus were to give the leavings of his food to a 
cfindala that would in his case be an offering made into the

give bis ucchista to one not a brahmana, unless certain rather obnoxious 
things were done to it. Manu IV. 80 forbids the giving of ucchitfa to 
a 6odra (who ie not a dependant) while Manu X. 125 allows it to be given 
to a dfldra who is a dependant.

Self as Fire *â Chandogya V. 24. 4. This shows that the candala 
was the lowest in the social scale. ' Just as a pa&ya or 
vaideha, or the son of an ugra, after having made his bow 
strung &c/â Br. Up. III. 8.2. In the Br. Up. IV. 3.22 mention is 
made of both candala and paulkasa and in IV. 3.37 it is said 110 
that ' just as when a king pays a visit, the ugras, pratyenasas 
( thief catohers ), the sutas and headmen of the village make 
arrangements for him with food and drink and with pavilions.' 
Here ugras seem to be a group of nobles subordinate to the 
king. In later literature ugra is the offspring of a ksatriya 
from a sudra woman ( Yaj. I. 91 ). In the Rg. X 97. 12 the word 
ugra occurs * You destroy disease just as an ugra who is a 
mediator or arbitrator ( removes dispute ). % What ugra means 
here cannot be said with certainty. It may only mean a ' formi- 
dable ohief or king.' 

The rathakara and nisada deserve a passing notice. The 
Tai. Br. I. 1. 4 after stating that the brahmana should conse- 
crate sacred fires in the spring, the ksatriya in summer, the 
vaisya in autumn, ordains that the rathakara should consecrate 
sacred fires in the rainy season. The question arises whether 
the rathakara is a member of the three higher castes who has 
taken in economic distress to the profession of making chariots 
or is a person belonging to a caste other than the three higher 
varnas. Jaimini in his Pttrvamlmaiisa-sutra ( VI. 1. 44-50 ) 
disousses this question and establishes 111 that the rathakara is a 
member of a caste other than the three higher varnas, that he 
has on account of the express words in the iruti the privilege to 
consecrate sacred fires with vedic mantras, that the mantra for 
the consecration of rathakaras is 4 rbhanam tva* (Tai. Br. 1. 1. 4) 
and that the rathakaras are the caste called Saudhanvana which 
is neither &&dra nor one of the three higher ones, but is 
slightly inferior to the three higher varnas. Visvariipa ut (on

belonging to the three higher varnas, was allowed the privilege 
of upanayana, but adds that this dictum of the smrfci is due to 
mistake, it being misled by the fact that he is allowed the 
privilege of Sdhana 113 ( consecration of sacred fires ). In 
modern times the members of the carpenter caste in certain parts 
of the Deccan at least are in the habit of performing the upa- 
nayana and wearing the sacred thread. 

With reference to an isti offered to Rudra a Vedio text says 
1 one should make a nisadasthapati perform this isti.' The 
Purvamlmansft sutra m ( VI. 1. 51-52 ) discusses the question 
whether this authorises a nisada who is himself a chieftain or a 
chieftain (who is a member of the three higher varnas) of nisadas. 
The established conclusion is that the isti is to be performed by a 
niÂ§5da who is a chieftain though he be beyond the pale of the 
three varnas, as the Karmadharaya compound is the proper way 
of dissolving the compound and not the genitive Tatpurusa. The 
Ait. Br. (37. 7) says 11S * just as the nisadas, or selagas (thieves) or 
evil-doers seize a wealthy man in a forest and throwing him in 
a well run away with his wealth.' The Sahkhayana Br. ( 25. 15 ) 
allows one who had performed the Visvajifc sacrifice ( in which 
everything is given away ) to stay in a settlement of nisadas 
whose food is the lowest that he is allowed to take. The Katya- 
yana^rauta-sutra ( 1. 1. 12-14 ) says ,l6 that * the chieftain who 
is a nisada can offer a cam of Gavedhuka cc^n to Rudra, but 
this offering is to be made in ordinary fire ( and not in the fires 
consecrated with Vedic mantras ) i. e. the permission to offer 
Raudra isti does not entitle him to perform Vedic consecration 
of fire ( ftdhSna ). But according to SatySsadba 117 -kalpa III. 1 
both the nisada and the rathakara are entitled to perform 
Agnihotra and Daria-purnamftsa.

The Aitarey a Brahmana 118 narrates that ViSvamitra cursed 
his senior fifty sons, when they did not agree to his pro- 
posal to treat Sunahsepa ( Devarata ) as his son, that they would 
associate with the lowest castes and that they became the 
Andhras, Pundras, Sabaras, Pulindas and Mutibas who are 
among the lowest of society and are mostly composed of dasyus. 
It is probably owing to this legend that the Manusmrti m ( X. 
43-45 ) is prepared to regard the Paundrakas, the Odras, Dravi- 
das, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, ClnaÂ«, 
Kiratas, Daradas and Kha6as as being originally ksatriya 
castes, but later on reduced to the position of Madras by the non- 
performance of Vedio samskaras ( like upanayana ) and by 
the absence of contact with brahmanas. Manu further adds 
that the various castes that are outside the ( influence of the ) 
four varnas are all known as dasyus whether they speak the 
language of Mlecchas or of Aryas. 

One very important question is whether the theory of the 
four varnas with their peculiar privileges and duties described 
in the dharmasutras and other smrfcis was merely a theory even 
in the most ancient times. When the Purusasukta of the 
Rgveda speaks of Brahmana, Rajanya, Vaisya and Stldra or 
when the Satapafcha Brahmana expressly says that they are four 
varnas, it appears to me that they speak of facts existing in 
their times and nofc merely of a theory which was to be striven 
for as an ideal. Smrfci writers try to place all their dicta in 
the frame-work of the varnas because the four varnas and their 
duties and privileges had been more or less clearly defined in 
the times of the Vedas and Brahmanas, which according to the 
authors of the smrfcis were 6ruti, eternal and infallible. They 
tried to approximate the state of society existing in their times 
to the varnas which they held were of hoary antiquity. But 
there is nothing to show that the same difficulties were felt by 
the authors of the Vedic hymns and the Brahmanas. The 
manner in which they refer to the privileges and disabilities of 
the several varnas have such a deep ring of actuality that one 
must concede that the varnas spoken of in them represented the

real divisions of society at least to a very great extent, if not 
cent percent. 

The preceding discussion renders the following propositions 
most probable ; 

(1) that in the earliest times about which we have 
literary records there were only two varnas, the Sryas and their 
opponents the dasyus or dasas\ that the difference between the 
two was based on difference of colour and culture and was thus 
more or less racial and cultural ; 

(2) that centuries before the samhita period closed the 
dasyus had been conquered and were given a position subservi- 
ent to the aryas ; 

(3) that the sudras were the dasyus so subjugated and 
made subservient ; 

(4) that the spirit of exclusiveness and pride of superio- 
rity existing among the aryas with reference to dasyus soon 
extended to groups among the aryas themselves ; 

(5) that by the time of the Brahmana Literature, 
brShmanas ( men supposed to be devoted to learning and priest- 
hood ), ksatriyas ( kings, noblemen and some warriors ) and 
vaisyas ( the artisans and common people ) had become sepa- 
rated into groups more or less dependent on birth and that the 
brahmana la0 had come to be regarded as superior to the ksatriya 
by the fact of birth ; 

(6) that even such low castes as c&ndalas and paulkasas 
had been evolved long before the end of the Vedic period ; 

(7) that owing to cultural advance, division of labour 
arose and numerous arts and crafts had been developed and 
they were in process of contributing to the complexity of the 
system by creating numerous sub-castes based upon occu- 
pations ; 

(8) that besides the four varnas intermediate castes like 
the rathakftra had been evolved ; 

(9) that there were certain non-Aryan tribes which 
were supposed to have been originally ksatriyas but fallen 
later on. 



120. That this theory of four varnas was well-known to Buddhist 
literary works is shown by Fick chap. II. p. 17 ( the only difference 
being that in the Buddhist works the ksatriya is put first and the 
brShmaya after him ).

Several centuries before the Christian era there were 
several castes. This follows not only from the dharmasutras 
but also from the ancient Buddhist works and from the meagre 
existing fragments of the work of Megasthenes on India. 
Though Megasthenes was confused in his statements about 
the caste system as prevalent in his day, some propositions are 
clearly deducible therefrom. He states (pp. 40 ff) that the 
whole population of India was divided into seven castes, 
(1) philosophers, (2) husbandmen, (3) neatherds and shepherds, 
(4) artisans, (5) military, (6) overseers, (7) councillors and 
assessors. Out of these 1 and 5 correspond to brahmanas and 
ksatriyas, 2-3 to vaisyas, 4 to sudras ; 6th and 7th correspond 
to adhyaksas and amatyas ( as in Kautilya's Artha^astra ) and 
are not really castes but occupations. He probably regards 
them as castes because the offices of the adhyaksas and amatyas 
were generally hereditary or at least he gathered that they 
were so. Megasthenes' further statement ( pp. 43-44 ) that * no 
one is allowed to marry out of his own caste or to exeroise 
any calling or art except his own' shows that the prevailing 
tendency was that caste had become exclusive and mostly 
occupational in his day, though there must have been excep- 
tions of which he was not informed. 

The ancient writers on dharma&astra strive very hard to 
aocount for the bewildering ramifioations of the caste system 
from the four varnas that were spoken of in the iruti ( revela- 
tion ). There is unanimity on the theory that the numerous 
castes actually found in the country arose from the unions 
of males of different varnas with women belonging to varrias 
differing from their own. The divergences ( and they are 



6h. II ] Varw and castes derived therefrom 51 

many) among the several srartikaras relate only to details. 
The smrti writers had before them the hoary theory of four 
varnas vouched for by infallible Vedic authority, but they 
were at the same time quite cognisant of the realities in 
society viz. the separate existence of numerous castes and 
sub-castes that had varying claims as regards social status and 
that were based in popular estimation on birth alone. Therefore, 
when one criticizes the smrti view of the derivation of 
numerous castes from the mixture or confusion (samkara) of 
the four varnas as purely hypothetical and imaginary, the 
criticism is true only partially. The smrtis were composed in 
different parts of India at different times and they were meant 
to supply a popular want, to guide the people and to reflect the 
prevailing state of society and popular feeling. Therefore, it 
must be admitted that the numerous castes mentioned in the 
smrtis did exist at the time of the smrtis, that the social status 
of the several castes might have varied from country to country 
or from epoch to epoch, that the peculiar avocations and means 
of livelihood assigned to the various castes reflected the real 
state of things. The element of hypothesis and speculation lies 
only in the theory of a particular sub-caste having sprung 
from the union of two persons belonging to two particular 
varnas or castes. 121 This description of the origin of the 
several castes was only indicative of the author's view or of 
the accepted view about the social status of those castes in 
particular localities. There is here, as a matter of fact, great 
divergence of views among the several authors. 

In the first place all writers on dharmasastra start with 
the propositions viz. (1) that the four varnas, brahmana, ksatriya, 
vaisya and siidra, are arranged in a descending scale of social 
status ; and ( 2 ) that marriage is or was permissible between 
a male of a higher varna with a woman of a lower varna, but 
the union of a woman of a higher varna with a male of varna 
lower than her own is reprehensible and not permitted. There 
is a third proposition advanced by many writers that a man 
belongs to a particular varna or jati by birth only i. e. if born 
in lawful wedlock of parents both of whom belong to that varna

or jati. IM This Is the view held by all medieval writers and 
digests and it is expressly said that a man belongs to a caste 
by birth and no actions of his can alter that fact, that several 
castes are like the species of animals and that oaste attaches 
to the body and not to the soul (vide Sutasarhhita ). When 
a male of a higher varna marries a woman of a lower varna, 
the marriage is said to be anuloma ( lit with the hair, in the 
natural order ) and the offspring is said to be anuloma ; when 
there is a union of a woman of a higher varna with a male of a 
lower varna, it is said to be pratiloma ( against the hair, i. e. 
against the natural or proper order ) and the children of the 
union are said to be pratiloma. These two words anuloma and 
pratiloma ( as applied to marriage or progeny ) hardly ever occur 
in the vedic literature. In the Br. Up. ( II. 1. 15 ) and KausI- 
taki Br. Up. IV. 18 ( quoted in note 89 above ) the word 
4 pratiloma ' is applied to the procedure adopted by a brahmana 
of going to a ksatriya for knowledge about brahman. From 
this it may possibly be inferred that pratiloma and anuloma 
might have been employed with reference to marriages also 
( in the days of the Upanisad ). Panini ( IV. 4. 28 ) teaches the 
formation of words from anuloma and pratiloma. They occur 
in Gautama ( IV. 14-15 ), Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 8. 8 ), Vasistha ( 18. 7 ), 
Manu ( X. 13 ), Yaj. (I. 95 ) and other smrti works. 

One important question is whether the theory of anuloma 
or pratiloma castes presupposes a marriage or only a union 
( outside marriage ) of a man and a woman. The 5.p. Dh. S. 
( II. 6. 13. 1, 3-4 ) lays down m that a man must marry a virgin 
of his own varna with the rites prescribed by the iastras and 
only the son born of such a marriage is entitled to the privileges 
and occupation of his father, that sexual intercourse with a 
woman who has been married by another or on whom the 
proper ceremonies of marriage are not performed or who

belongs to another caste is condemned and that the son ( and 
not the daughter ) born of such an union is condemned ( through 
the sin of the parents ). So Apastamba looked with disfavour 
even on marriages called anuloma. He is entirely silent about 
anuloma and pratiloma castes. It is no doubt true that most 
ancient writers like Gautama ( IV. 1 ), Vasistha ( I. 24 ), Manu 
( III. 12-13 ), Yaj. ( I. 55 and 57 ) prescribe that a person should 
by preference marry a girl of his own varna but also allow the 
marriage of a person with a girl of another varna lower than 
his own. Yaj. ( I. 92 ) expressly says that the six anuloma 
castes, miirdhavasikta, ambastha, nisada, mahisya, ligra, and 
karana are so called only when they are the offspring of 
women married by men of higher varnas. Manu ( X 41 ) 
says that the sir anuloma castes are entitled to the rites 
( sarhskaras like upanayana ) performed for dvijas, but that the 
pratiloma castes are like 6iidras ( i. e. even when a pratiloma 
caste springs from a brahmana woman and a ksatriya or 
vai&ya male they cannot have upanayana and other rites 
of dvijas performed for them, though both parents are 
dvijas ). Kautilya 184 ( III. 7 ) also says that all pratilomas 
except cSndalas are like Sudras; Visnu says that they 
are condemned by all Aryas. Devala 185 (quoted by ParaSara- 
madhavlya I. 2. p. 122 ) says that pratilomas are outside 
the pale of the system of varnas and are patita. The 
Smrtyarthasara p. 13 says that anuloma sons and those born of 
the miirdhavasikta and other anuloma castes are dvijUtis and are 
entitled to samsk&ras as dvijatis. Commentators like Kulluka 
( on Manu X. 11 ) say that, as no marriage is legally possible 
between a woman of a higher varna and a male of a lower 
varna, all the pratilomas are born outside lawful wedlock. 
Gautama (IV. 20) says that all pratilomas are dhar?nahtna t 
which is interpreted by the Mit. on Yaj. Ill, 262 as meaning that 
they cannot have upanayana and similar sarhskaras of dvijas 
performed for them, though they are amenable to the rules of 
morality and entitled to perform vratas and prayaicittas. Vasistha, 
Baudhayana and several others do not make it clear whether, 
when they speak of pratilomas, they contemplate offspring of legal

marriages or only of illegitimate and adulterous unions. But 
it will be seen from the list appended below that Usanas and 
Vaikhanasa almost always make a distinction between the 
caste assigned to the offspring of the union of parents of 
different varnas, according as there is a marriage between the 
two or it is only a clandestine, illegitimate or adulterous union. 
For example, Usanas , says 126 that when there is a marriage 
between a ksatriya male and a brahmana female, the offspring 
is called suta, while the offspring of a clandestine union 
between a brahmana woman and a ksatriya male was called 
rathakara. So these two authors held that there could be a 
legal marriage when a woman of a higher varna married a male 
of a lower varna. m There were several other works like the 
Sutasamhita ( Sivamahatmyakhanda chap. 12. 12-48) where a 
similar distinction is made between the children of marriages 
and clandestine unions. The Mit. on Yaj, I. 90 says that such 
progeny as kunda and golaka ( Manu III, 174 ), kanlna, saho- 
dhaja ( who are all not due to intercourse in wedlock ) are 
different from savarna, anuloma and pratiloma and are to be 
treated as siidras and that the ksetraja son is to be treated as in 
a different category (since niyoga is allowed by the smrtis 
and by the usage of slstas ) and belongs to the caste of his 
mother. Apararka ( on Yaj. I. 92 p. 118 ) does not accept this 
view and holds that even kanlna and sahodha may be held to 
be brahmanas ( if the begetter can be proved to have been a 
brahmana); while Visvarupa on Yaj. II. 133 says that kanlna 
and gudhaja must be deemed to belong to the mother's caste as 
the begetter may not be known and that sahodhaja ( II. 135 ) is 
also to be so treated. These several kinds of secondary sons will 
be treated under inheritance. 

A few words must be said about the word jati. The idea of 
varna was as we have seen based originally on race, culture, cha. 
racter and profession. It takes account mainly of the moral and 
intellectual worth of man and is a system of classes which appears 
more or less natural. The ideal of varna even in the smrtis 
lays far more emphasis on duties, on a high standard of effort 
for the community or society rather than on the rights and pri- 
vileges of birth. The system of jatis (castes) lays all emphasis on

birth and heredity and tends to create the mentality of clinging 
to privileges without trying to fulfil the obligations correspond- 
ing to such privileges. The word ' jati ' in the sense of caste 
hardly ever occurs in the vedic literature. In the Nirukta m 
( XII. 13 ) it is said ' after agnicayana ( the building 
of the fire altar), a man should not approach a rama 
(for sexual intercourse); rama is so called because she is 
approached only for pleasure and not for ( accumulation of ) 
merit; she is of a dark casfce*. Here the word krsnajatlya occurs 
with reference to a woman of the sudra caste. Almost these 
very words occur in Vasis^ha ( 18* 17-18 ) 189 where for krsna- 
jatlya the word krsnavarna is substituted. Visvarupa on Yaj. 
1.56 (yad-ucyate etc.) 130 quotes these words as a brahmana 
text, but there the word is krsnavarnlya. Therefore, the use of 
the word jati in the sense of caste can be traced back at least 
to the times of the Nirukta. Panini (V. 4. 9 ) 131 teaches the 
formation of words like ' brahmanajatlya' derived from words 
ending in'jati'(in the sense of caste). The expression 'jatidharma* 
( rules of castes ) occurs in Gautama XI. 20, Vasistha I. 17 and 
XIX. 7, Manu 1. 118 and VIII. 41 and the word jati ( caste ) 
occurs also in Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 1, II. 1. 2. 3, Manu ( IV. 141, 
X. 11, 18, 40, 97 ), Yaj. ( I. 95, 361, II. 69, 206, III. 213), Narada 
( rnadana 288 ) arid in the vartika on Panini IV. 1. 137. Varna 
and jati are sometimes clearly distinguished as in Yaj II. 69 
and 206. But very often they are confounded. In Manu X. 
27, 31 the word varna is used in the sense of mixed castes 
(jatis). Conversely the word jati often appears to be used tc 
indicate * varna*. Vide Manu III. 15, VIII. 177, IX. 86 and 
335, X. 41 and Yaj. I. 89 ( in which latter sajati appears to 
mean ' savarna ' ). 

Even when anuloma marriages were allowed there is no 
unanimity among the sages and the smrfcis as to the status of 
the progeny of such unions. Three different views are found. 
The first view is that if a male of one varna married a female of 
the varna immediately after it, the progeny belonged to the varna

of the father; e. g. Baud. Dh. S. ,S8 ( I. 8. 6 and L 9. 3 ) says that 
sons born to a person of a savarna wife or a wife of the varna 
next to his own are savarna i. e. the son of a brahmana from 
a wife of the k?atriya varna is a brahmana. The AnuSasana- 
parva 48. 4, Narada ( strlpurhsa 106 ) and Kautilya ( III. 7 ) 
say the same. Gautama IV, 15 as interpreted by Haradatta 
appears to say that the off-spring of a brahmana from a ksafcriya 
wife is called savarna, but not the offspring of a ksafcriya 
male from a vaisya wife or of a vaisya male from a 
Sadra wife. Fick ( pp. 54-57 ) shows that even according 
to the Bhaddasala Jafcaka * the family of the mother does not 
matter; the family of the father alone is important'. The 
second view is that the progeny of anuloma unions is in 
status lower than the father, but higher than the mother; 
e. g. Manu X. 6 * sages declare the sons begotten by dvijas 
on wives of varnas immediately next to theirs as similar ( to 
the fathers, but not of the same varna with the fathers ) but 
tainted by the inferiority of their mothers/ The third view 
(and this is the common view) is that the progeny of anu- 
loma marriages is of the same varna as regards its privileges 
and obligations as the mother's ; e. g. vide Visnu Dh. S. 16. 2 182 
and Sankha ( prose ) quoted by the Mit. on Yaj I. 91 and 
Apararka (p. 118). A classical echo of this view is found 
in the Sakuntala of Kalidasa 154 where king Dusyanta exclaims 
aside to himself * would that this girl were born of the sage 
from a wife who was not savarna '. Medhatithi on Manu X. 6 
says that Pandu, Dhrtaras^ra and Vidura being ksetraja sons 
took the caste of their mothers. The Mit. explains the words of 
Sankha by saying that the offspring of anuloma marriages such 
as murdhavasikta are not really different from ksatriyas, that 
they have the same samskaras but they do not become ksatriyas 
etc. and are dubbed by these names to indicate their mixed 
origin and come to form separate sub-castes. The pratilomas t 
as said above, are lower in status than any of the two parents.

Gh$ II ] Varna and the enumeration of castes 5? 

The ancient dharmasutras mention only a few mixed castes. 
Ap. Dh. S. mentions only cindala, paulkasa and vaina. 
Gautama names five anuloma castes, six pratiloma, one and 
eight others according to the view of some. Baudhayana adds to 
those mentioned by Gautama a few more viz. rathakaraj 
svapaka, vaina and kukkuta. Vasistha names even a smaller 
number than Gautama and Baudhayana. It is Manu ( X ) and 
Visnu Dh. S. ( XVI ) that for the first time dilate upon the 
avocations of the mixed castes. Manu refers to 6 anuloma, 6 
pratiloma and 20 doubly mixed castes and states the avocations 
of about 23 ; Y&j. names only 13 castes (other than the four 
varnas). Usanas names about 40 and gives their peculiar 
avocations. All the smrbis taken together hardly mention more 
than about one hundred castes. 

The number of primary anulomas is only six ( vide Manu 
X. 10, Yaj I. 91-92 ), but Manu names only three of them, viz. 
ambastha, nisada and ugra. The primary pratilomas also are 
six ( vide Manu X. 11-12 and 16-17 and Yaj. I. 93-94) viz. 
suta, vaidehaka, c5ndaia, mSgadha, ksatr, and ayogava. 
Further sub-castes are said to arise from the unions of the 
anulomas and pratilomas with the four varnas and of the male 
of one anuloma and the female of another, from the union of 
pratilomas among themselves and from the union of a male or 
female of an anuloma caste and the female or male of a pratiloma 
caste. For example, Yaj. I. 95 defines rathakara as the offspring 
of a mahisya male and a karana female, i. e. it is a further 
mixture between two anuloma castes. The Mit. on Yaj, I. 95 
says that upanayana and other samskaraa are performed for the 
offspring of anuloma persons marrying among themselves. The 
Smrtyartbasara (p. 13) says the same 135 . Similarly Manu X. 15 
says that avrta and abhlra spring from the union of a br&hmana 
with an ugra girl and an ambastha girl respectively ( i. e. from 
the union of a brahmana with anuloma caste girls). Manu 
X. 19 says that svapaka is the offspring of a ksatr male ( a 
pratiloma ) with an ugra female ( an anuloma ). Manu X 33 
defines maifcreyaka as the offspring of a vaidehaka male and an 
ftydjgava female (i.e. from parents who are both pratiloma). A

58 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. 4 II 

smrti verse quoted' 88 by VisvarQpa on Y&j. I. 95 says that there 
are six anulomas, 24 doubly, mixed castes ( due to the union of 
the six anulomas with the four varnas ), 6 pratilomas and 24 
doubly mixed castes ( due to the unions of 6 pratilomas 
with four varnas) i. e. in all 60 and further mixtures of 
these among themselves give rise to innumerable sub-castes. 
Similarly Visnu Db. S. 16. 7 m says that the further mixed 
castes arising from the unions of mixed castes are numberless. 
This shows that before the time of the Visnudharmasutra ( i. e. 
at least about 2000 years ago ) numberless castes and sub-castes 
had been formed and the writers on dharmaiastra practically 
gave up in despair the task of deriving them, even though 
mediately* from the primary varnas. The same state of things 
was continued and was rather aggravated by the time of the 
nibandhakdras. Medhatithi on Manu X. 31 speaks of 60 mixed 
castes along with the four varnas and adds that by the inter- 
mingling of these endless sub castes are formed. The 
Mitfiksara 158 on Yaj. L 95 observes that since the castes spring- 
ing from the double intermingling of varnas are innumerable, 
it is impossible to describe or enumerate them. Similarly the 
Krtyakalpataru in its prakirnaka topic of vyavahara secWon, 
when dealing with castes, merely quotes several passages from 
the smrtis and does not add a word of its own about the castes, 
their names or avocations in its own day (first half of 
12th century ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 94 139 expressly says that 
the avocations of the pratilomas ( about which Yaj. is silent ) 
should be understood from the smrtis of USanas and Manu. 
Medieval writers on dharmaiastra usually ignore the treat- 
ment in detail of the numerous sub-castes and content themselves 
with dilating upon the duties of the four varnas. 

There was great diversity of opinion among the 
smrtikaras about the derivation and status of the several sub- 
castes. We find that the same sub-caste is known under five or 
six different names even so early as the present Manusmrti.

Oh. II ] Varya and sub-castes 50 

Maim X. 22 gives seven names for the same caste and Manu 
X. 23 gives five for another. ViSvarupa on Yftj. I. 92 explains 
that these different names are due to difference of locality. 140 
There is another difficulty. The same name given to a caste is 
differently derived by different writers ( vide under nisada and 
para&ava below )â¢ For the same sub-caste different names are 
given in different smrtis (vide under krfca and ramaka). It 
became difficult to assign any peculiar derivation for groups of 
people and so Manu (X. 40), Vasistha 141 ( 18.7 ) and Anusasana- 
parva 148. 29 laid down that men's sub-caste was to be known 
from their actions and occupations. This shows that according 
to most writers castes in the times of the smrtis were 
predominantly occupational. 

One word that frequently occurs in connection with 
castes and sub-castes is varnasamJcara ( or only samkara ). 
In Manu X 12 and 24 the word varnasamkara is used in the 
plural in the sense of mixed castes, while in Manu X 40 
( and in V. 89 ) the word samkara seems to be used in the 
sense of ' mixture or intermingling of varnas \ Gautama 
( VIII. 3 ) employs the word samkara and says ' on the two 
( the brahmana and the king ) depends the prosperity ( of men ), 
protection, the prevention of mixture (of varnas) and the 
( accumulation of ) merit ( or the observance of dharma ). 14B 
Narada ( strlpumsa 102 ) u3 says ' to be born from a union in 
the inverse order of varnas amounts to varnasamkara;' while 
Brhaspati quoted in the Krtyakalpataru appears to apply the 
word varnasamkara to both anuloma and pratiloma castes. 
Baud. 144 Dh. S. (I. 9. 16) says that those who are born of

varnasamkara are called vratyas. The Mil. on Y&j I. 96 applies 
the word varnasamkara to both anuloma and pratiloma progeny. 
Medhafcifchi 145 on Manu V. 88 says that the word ' saihkarajata* 
indicates pratilomas like ayogava and that even though as 
regards anulomas there is intermingling ( of varnas ), yet as 
they have the privileges of the caste of their mothers, even 
Manu himself does not apply the word samkirnayoni to them as 
seen above ( Manu X. 25 ). Yama 146 quoted in the Krtyakal- 
pataru says ' Varnasamkara arises by the violation of the res- 
trictions ( about marriage ) ; if the proper order of varnas ( i. e. 
male of higher varna marrying a woman of a lower varna) is 
followed, ( the offspring) is entitled to be regarded as belonging 
to the system of varnas, but if the reverse order is followed it is 
sin. * Manu ( X. 24 ) says ' mixed castes arise by members of 
one varna having sexual intercourse with women of another 
varna, by marrying women who ought not to have been married 
( such as a sagotra girl ) and by neglect of the duties peculiar to 
one's varna \ The Anu^asanaparva 48. I 147 remarks that 
* varnasamkara arises from wealth, greed, desires, uncertainty 
about the varna (of a person) or ignorance about varna'. 
Even in such a philosophical treatise as the Bhagavad-glta 
( I. 41-43 ), it is said * when women become corrupt ( or demo- 
ralised ), intermingling of varnas arises ; samkara necessarily 
leads the whole family and the destroyer of the family to hell. 
By reason of these transgressions of the destroyers of families 
which bring about varnasamkara, the ancient caste observances 
and family observances are subverted.' 

On account of the great emphasis laid on the prevention 
of mrnasamkara the smrtis ordain that it is one of the principal 
duties of the king to punish people if they transgress the rules 
prescribed for varnas and to punish men and women if guilty 
of varnasamkara. Gautama ( XI. 9-10 ) says ' the king should 
protect the varnas and asirainas according to the Â§astras and he 
should make them conform to their duties when they swerve

to all these viz. the observances of countries, castes and 
families should make the four varnas conform to their duties 
and should punish them when they go astray * ; Visnu Dh. S. 
III. 3 and Yaj. L 361, Markandeyapuarna 27, Matsyapurana 
215. 63 say the same. Narada ( strlpumsa 113 ) U8 says 
* when a brfihmana woman goes astray a candala is born 
from a Sudra male ( and the br&hmana woman ) ; therefore the 
king should specially protect women from sarhkara \ It is on 
account of this that so early as in the first centuries of the 
Christian era we see that king Vasithlputa Siri Pujumayi is 
extolled as having prevented the mixture of the four varnas ( E. 
I. vol. VIII pp. 60-61, ' vinivatitacatuvana-sakarasa ).* That 
varnasarhkara had gone too far in the opinion of the author of 
the Mahabharata ( Vanaparva 180. 31-33 ) follows from the 
following words which are despairingly put in the mouth of 
Yudbisthira 149 "It appears to me that it is very difficult to 
ascertain the caste of human beings on account of the confusion 
of all varnas ; all sorts of men are always begetting offspring 
from all sorts of women; speech, sexual intercourse, being born 
and death-these are common to all human beings ; and there is 
scriptural authority ( for this view ) in the words c We, who- 
ever we are, offer the sacrifice \ Hence those who have seen 
the truth regard character as the principal thing desired." 
Saihkaracarya in his bhasya on Vedantasutra I. 3. 33 remarks 
that, though in his day varnas and asramas had become disor- 
ganised and unstable as to their dharmas, that was not the 
case in other ages, since otherwise the sastras laying down 
regulations for them would have to be deemed purposeless 
or futile. 180 

Gautama ( IV. 18-19 ), Manu ( X. 64-65 ) and Yaj. ( I. 96 ) 
speak of a peculiar doctrine called Jafyutkarsa and Jatyapakarsa. 
These passages have given rise to some divergence of interpreta-

62 History of DharmatMra [ Ch. II 

Hon, but their general sense is clear, Gautama ( IV, 18 ) ,sl 
gays that according to the acaryas the anulomas when they 
marry in such a way that the bridegroom in each stage is higher 
or lower than the bride they rise to a higher or go down to a 
lower varna in the 7th or 5th generation ( respectively ). This is 
explained by Haradatta as follows : When a brahmana marries 
a ksatriya woman the daughter born of this marriage is called 
savarna ; if this latter is married to a brahmana and a daughter 
is born and this latter is again married by a brahmana and if 
this continues in the same way for seven generations, then when 
the 7th girl in descent marries a brahmana, whatever child is 
born of that union belongs to the brahmana varna (though in the 
preceding generations only the fathers were brahmanas and the 
mothers were all not strictly brahmanas, but only savarnas if at 
all ). This is called jahjutkarsa (rise in status as a caste). On the 
other hand, when a brahmana marries a ksatriya girl and a son 
is born who is called savarna, then that son marries a ksatriya 
girl and has a son and this is continued for Jive generations^ then 
when the fifth son ( in descent ) marries a ksatriya girl, the child 
born belongs to the ksatriya varna ( though in all the preceding 
generations the father was higher than ksatriya and the mother 
only was a ksatriya ). This is jatyapakarsa ( fall in status as a 
caste). The same rule holds good as regards a ksatriya 
marrying a vaiiya female and a vaisya marrying a 6udra 
female. The same rule applies among anulomas also 
e. g, if a savarna ( as defined by Gautama ) marries an 
ambastha girl and a daughter is born who again marries 
a savarna and this continues for seven generations, then 
the child of the 7th girl ( in descent ) from a savarna male 
becomes a savarna ( rises in status ) ; on the other hand if a 
savarna ( offspring of brahmana male and ksatriya female ) 
marries an ambastha girl and a son is born and that son 
marries an ambastha girl and their son marries an ambastha 
girl and this goes on for seven generations, then the child of 

ifa* IV. 18-19. In S. B. E. vol. II. pp. 196-197 the sutras are arranged 
differently i. e. the first ends at l saptame ' and pancame...ryah is 
another antra. Though this method makes a good sense it is opposed to 
the explanation of Haradatta, who explains that the option allowed by 
the use of ' v5 ' in the sUtra applies only where there is pre-eminence 
of character and learning (i. e. in such a case rise is possible oven in 
the 5th generation ).

the 7th ma] 3itt ) born of an ambastha wife becomes 

an ambastha ( i. e. there is jatyapakarsa as to anulomas ). 

According to Manu 158 X 64 when a brahmana marries a 
sudra woman, the daughter born is parasava, and if this 
pftrasava daughter marries a brahmana and the daughter of 
this latter union marries a brahmana and this continues for 
seven generations, then the seventh generation will be a 
brahmana ( i. e. there will be jatyutkarsa ). Conversely, if a 
brahmana marries a sudra woman and a son is born, he is 
a parasava and that son marries a sudra woman and their 
son again marries a sudra woman and this goes on for 7 
generations, the 7th generation becomes a mere sudra ( there is 
jatyapakarsa ). It will be seen that this differs from Gautama 
in several respects. In the first place for both jatyutkarsa and 
jatyapakarsa seven generations are prescribed, while in 
Gautama they are 7 and 5 respectively (according to Haradatta). 
In the second place according to Gautama the 8th in descent 
from the first anuloma marriage secures jatyutkarsa, while 
according to Manu, the 7th secures it. Further Manu is silent 
about jatyutkarsa when the original parents are anulomas. 
Beg|des, the oommentators of Manu shorten the period for rise 
or fall in jati as stated below. Manu X. 65 extends the same 
rules to the offspring of the marriage of a ksatriya with a 
vaisya woman and of a vaisya with a sudra woman. MedhStithi 
and Kulluka extend these express words of Manu further by 
explaining that if a brahmana marries a vaisya female and a 
daughter is born and she again marries a brahmana then in 
the fifth generation there will be jatyutkarsa ; conversely if a 
son is born from a brahmana and a vaisya wife, and he marries

to ' yuga ' by AparSrka on Yaj. I. 96 ( p. 119 ). In the S. B. B. vol. II 
p. 196 Dr. Btihler compares Ap. Dh. S. II. 5.10. 10-11 with Gautama 
IV. 22. But thejgreat scholar is not accurate here. Ap. does not speak of 
progeny of mixed marriages rising to higher status or being degraded 
to lower status after several generations ; he rather speaks of a 
gndra rising higher and higher in successive births. In the 
Anut&sanaparva (chap. 27. 5-6, 28. 6-13) it is said that after 
numberless births dudras and others become vaisyas and so on.

a vateya female and this goes on, then in the fifth generation 
the son will be a vaiSya ( i. e. there will be jatyapakarsa )Â» 
Similarly if a brahmana marries a ksatriya woman then there 
is jatyutkarsa or jatyapakarsa in three generations. 

Yajnavalkya ( I 96 ) nz speaks of two kinds of jatyutkarsa 
or jatyapakarsa viz. one due to marriage ( as in Manu and 
Gautama ) and another due to the avocation followed. 4 It should 
be understood that there is rise in caste in the 7th or even in 
the 5th generation ; if there is inversion as to the avocations, then 
there is corresponding similarity (of varna in the 7th or even 5th 
generation ).' This is elaborated by the Mitaksara as follows :â 
If a brahmana marries a sudra woman and a daughter is born she 
is a nisadl ; if this latter marries a brahmana and a daughter is 
born and she in turn marries a brahmana and this goes on for six 
generations, then the child of the 6th girl ( in descent ) becomes 
a brahmana ( he being 7th in descent ) ; similarly if a brahmana 
marries a vaisya woman and a girl is born, she is an ambastha ; 
if the latter marries a brahmana and a daughter is born and 
this goes on in the same way, then the fifth girl in descent has a 
child ( from a brahmana husband ) which is the 6tb in descent 
from the original anuloma marriage and which then becomes 
a brahmana. If a brahmana marries a ksatriya woman and a 
daughter is born who is called murdhavasikta ( Yaj. I. 91 ) and 
she marries a brahmana, then the fourth in descent marrying 
a brahmana has a child (5th in descent), then that child becomes 
a brahmana. Similarly, if a ksatriya married a Sudra female 
and a daughter was born, she was called ugra, then jatyutkarsa 
by marrying a higher male took place in the 6th generation. 
If a ksatriya married a vaisya woman, the daughter born was 
a mahisya and jatyutkarsa took place in the 5th generation. 
If a vateya married a Sudra woman, the daughter of the marriage 
is a karanl and if she marries a vaiÂ§ya, then in the fifth 
generation there would be jatyutkarsa. Certain peculiar 
avocations and activities are prescribed for the four var$as. 
Each varna may in times of difficulty follow the occupation 
peculiar to the caste immediately below it, but should not 
follow the avocations peculiar to the higher varnas ; ,5 * he must 
however revert to his proper avocation when the difficulty is

over (vide Vasistha II. 13-23, Visnu Dh. S. II. 15, Yftj. 1. 118-120, 
Gautama X. 1-7 &c). If a brahmana begins to follow the 
avocations peculiar to a sudra and has a son, who does the same 
and this goes on continuously for seven generations, the 7th 
becomes a sudra ( by caste ). If a brahmana begins to follow 
the avocations peculiar to a vaisya or a ksatriya then in the 
5th or 6th generation respectively there is fall in caste ( i. e. the 
5th or 6th becomes respectively a vaisya or ksatriya ). Similarly 
if a ksatriya follows the avocation of a vaisya or sudra and 
this goes on continuously, then the 5th or 6th ( respectively ) 
becomes a sudra or vaisya. Similarly if a vaisya takes to the work 
peculiar to sudras, then the fifth generation becomes sudra. 

Baud. 155 Dh. S. ( I. 8. 13-14 ) gives another illustration of 
jatyutkarsa. He says ' if a nisada ( the son of a brahmana 
from a sudra wife ) marries a nisadl ( and this goes on 
continuously ), then the fifth generation becomes free of the 
taint of a sudra status, he can have upanayana performed for 
him and his son ( 6th from the original nisada pair ) can have a 
vedic sacrifice performed for him.' 

These provisions would considerably lessen the rigour of 
the caste system based purely on birth. But one feels grave 
doubts whether such a method of jatyutkarsa or jatyapakarsa 
( particularly the one based on occupation ) was or could be ever 
enforced in actual life. It would have been impossible to 
remember descent in a particular way for five or seven genera- 
tions. The want of unanimity among the original smrtikSras 
and the commentators also points in the direction that the 
method advocated, though it might have originally some slight 
basis in fact, was only a hypothesis and an ideal. Hardly any 
examples of jatyutkarsa in the way set out by Manu or Yaj. 
occur in the literature on dharma-sastra or in inscriptions. In 
""the inscriptions we have authentic cases of intercaste marriages 
only, but hardly anything further 158 . From the Talgunda

66 History of Dharmasastra I Ch. II 

Mayfirasarman, who became exasperated with the Pallavas of 
Kanclpura and took up the sword to conquer the earth, that his 
descendants applied the affix * varman ' to their names ( as if 
they were ksatriyas, according to Manu II. 32 ) and Kakustha- 
varraan ( 4th in descent from Mayurasarman ) married his 
daughters to Gupta and other kings 187 . This shows that an 
originally brahmana family came to look upon itself as 
ksatriya by virtue of pursuing the profession of arms and 
governing the people. In the Mahabharata we meet with stories 
of kings who became brahmanas. For example, Anusasana 
30 speaks of Vlfcahavya, a king, as having become a brahmana ; 
similarly Salya ( 39. 36-37 ) speaks of Arstisena, Sindhudvlpa, 
Devapi and Visvamitra as having become brahmarias at a 
sacred spot on the Sarasvatl. In the Puranas also there are 
stories 158 of kings like Visvamitra, Mandhata, Sarhkrti, Kapi, 
Vadhryasva, Purukutsa, Arstisena, Ajamldha and others as 
having risen to the status of brahmanas. These are mythical 
sages and their rise is not stated to have been duo to the prin- 
ciple of jatyutkarsa ,59 . Ibbetson ( Report on the census of the 
Punjab 1881, pp. 174-176 ) notes that brahmanas following 
certain professions became degraded and that the caste 
was changed. 

That the professional castes were wealthy and well organized 
follows from the dharmasastra works and epigraphic records. 
In this connection the words sreni, puga, gana, vrEta and 
sangha deserve to be carefully studied. All these were called 
samuha (group) or varga according to Katyayana. 160 These

words occur in the Vedic literature, but the sense is generally 
' a group â¢ and there is no special meaning attached, '^reni' 
occurs in the Rg. 1. 163. 10 lel ( like flamingoes the horses press 
forward in rows or groups ) ; both vrata and gaw occur in Rg. 
III. 26. 6, V. 53. 11 and in numerous other places. The Kausl- 
taki Br. 16. 7 168 speaks of Rudra as puga (as he is the head of 
the band of Maruts ). Ap. Dh. S. I 1. 3. 26 18 * quotes a BrSh- 
mana passage about a group ( sangha ) of brahmacSrins going 
about for alms. Panini teaches 164 the formation of derivatives 
from puga, gana, sangha ( V. 2. 52 ), from vrSta ( V. 2. 21 ). 
In his time it appears the words had acquired specific meanings. 
The Mahabhasya explains ( on Panini V. 2. 21 ) that vratas are 
groups formed by men of various castes with no fixed means 
of livelihood but subsisting by the might (or strength) of 
their bodies (by bodily labour of various kinds). The 
Kasika 165 explains pugas as associations of men of different 
castes with no fixed professions, who are solely bent on making 
money or seeking pleasure. Kautilya in one place distinguishes 
between soldiers and srenis ( guilds ) and in another place says 
that the guilds of ksatriyas in Kambhoja and Suras^ra subsist 
by the profession of arras and vartS ( agriculture ). 166 Vas. Dh. 
S. XVI. 15 says that boundary disputes are to be settled by the 
evidence of the old men in the village or town or of guilds 
( 6reni ) when there is conflict of documentary evidence. Visnu 
Dh. S. V. 167 prescribes banishment for him who embezzles 
the wealth of associations ( gana ) and who transgresses the 
conventions made by them. Manu ( VIII. 219 ) has a similar 
rule about village and local associations (sangha). The 
above words are variously explained by the several com men-

tators ( vide my notes to the translation of Katyayana verses 187 
678-682 of that reconstructed smrti). Katyayana says 'Naigama 
is an association of citizens of the same city, vrata is a company 
of soldiers carrying various arms, puga is an association of 
traders and the like, gana is a group of br&hmanas, sahgha is 
a body of Bauddhas or Jainas ; and bands of oandalas and 
6vapacas are called gulma/ Yaj. ( I. 361 ) directs the king to 
punish kulas, castes, firenis, ganas, if they transgress their rules 
(of conduot or business) and the Mit. explains dreni as a 
guild of sellers of betel leaves and the like and gana as of 
1 helabukas ' ( horse-dealers ) ; while Yaj. II. 192 and Narada 168 
( samayasyanapakarma 2 ) require the king to prevent the 
breach of the conventions of 6reni, naigama, puga, vrata, gana 
and to confirm them in their traditional occupations. Yaj. IL 
30 says that pugas and Srenis had authority to investigate dis - 
putes and that the puga was a higher tribunal than the dreni. The 
Mit. on this explains that puga is an association of people of diffe-* 
rent castes and different occupations that stay in one locality, 
while a dreni is a group of people of different castes, that subsist 
by the occupation of one caste and gives ' hedabukas ' ' tambu- 
likas ' ( betel sellers ), ' kuvindas ' ( weavers ) and * carmakaras * 
( shoe-makers ) as examples of srenis. In the H^rsa stone of 
Chahamana Vigraharaja ( E. I. vol. II. p. 124 ) there is a 
reference to one dramma for each horse given to ' hedavikas.* In 
the Nasik Inscription No. 15 ( E. I. vol. VIII p. 88 ) we are told 
that in the reign of the Abhlra king Isvarasena 1000 karsapanas 
were deposited with an association of potters as a permanent 
donation yielding interest, 500 with a guild of oilmen and 2000 
with a guild of watermen ( udaka-yantra-sreni ) for medicines to 
be given to sick bhiksus. No. 9 and No. 12 of the inscriptions 
at Nasik also contain reference to deposits of money with the 
guild of weavers. The Mathura Brahml inscription of Huviska's 
reign mentions a guild of flour-makers ( samitakara, vide E. I. 
vol. 21 p. 55 at p. 61 ). The Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription 
( A. S. W. I. vol. IV p. 97 ) refers to an investment of monies 
with the guild ( 6reni ) of bamboo- workers and of braziers 
( kasakara ). The Indore copperplate of Skandagupta ( of the 
Gupta samvat 146 ) speaks of the deposit with the guilds of the

oilmen of Indrapura for permanently securing a supply of two 
polos of oil ( 0. 1. 1, vol. Ill p. 70 ). Similarly it is said that a 
guild of silk weavers from Lata ( southern Gujerat ) came to 
Dasapura ( Dasor in Malwa ) and built a temple of the sun in 
the Malava year 494 i. e. 437-38 A. D. ( 0. L I. vol. Ill p. 81 = 
I. A. vol. 15 p. 194 ). These examples show that about the first 
centuries of the Christian era such castes as woodworkers, 
oilmen, betel sellers and weavers that are at present very 
low in the hierarchy of castes had very efficient caste guilds, so 
famous for their organization, integrity and stability that people 
deposited with them thousands for permanent services to objects 
of charity. 169 

We shall now append a list of several castes enumerated 
or mentioned in smrfci and other dharmasastra works from 
about 500 B. C. to 1000 A. D. in alphabetical ( Sanskrit ) order, 
They are not given in a tabular form owing to numerous 
contradictory statements in the smrtis themselves. References 
are given only to a few smrfcis, the principal ones drawn upon 
being the Dharmasufcras, Manu, Yajâ Vaik. smarta-sufcra 
X. 11-15, Usanas, the Sutasamhita ( Siva-mahatmya-khanda 
chap. 12 ). It is hoped that the list is fairly exhaustive for the 
smrti period. It will be noticed that many of the caste names 
collected here still occur under the same forms or under 
slightly modified forms of the names. 

Andhra. Vide above note 118 quoting the Ait. Br. Manu 
X. 36 says it was a low subcaste sprung from Vaidehaka fathei 
and Kara vara mother and that Andhras were to live outside the 
village and to subsist ( X. 48 ) by killing wild beasts. In the 
edicts of Asoka the Andhras are associated with Pulindas ( vide 
Rook Edict No. 13 ). The Udyogaparva ( 160. 103 ) mentions 
Andhras ( probably as people of Andhradesa ) along with 
Dravidas and Kancyas. In the Nalanda plate of Devapaladevs 
( E. I. vol. 17 p. 321 ) meda, andhraka and candala are spoken 
of as the lowest castes. In Orissa one scheduled caste is noted 
as Adi-Andhra ( vide Sen. O. 0. 1936 ). 

Antya. According to Vas. Dh. S. 16.30, Manu 17. 79, 
VIII. 68, Yaj. 1. 148, 197, Atri 251, Likhita 92, verse Apastamba 
( III. 1 ) this word is a generic appellation for all lowest castei

like the c&nd&la. Vide the chapter on ' untouohablea \ The 
word * b&hya ' has the same sense. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 9. 18 says 
that there is a oessation of Vedic study on the day on which 
bahya senter a village; vide also Nirada (rnadina 155), 
Visnu Dh. S. 16.14. 

Antyaja. This word is applied to all lowest castes like the 
candala in Manu IV. 61, Visnu Dh. S. 36.7, Yaj. I. 273, Brhad- 
yama ( quoted in Mit. on Yaj. III. 260 ). In Manu VIII. 279 
the word is used in the sense of ' sudra '. Various enumerations 
of the subdivisions of antyajas are found in the smrtis. Atri 199 
enumerates 170 seven antyajas viz. rajaka ( washerman ), 
carmakSra ( worker in hides ), nata ( dancer caste, represented 
in the Deccan by Kolhatis ), buroda ( worker in bamboos ), 
kaivarta ( fisherman ), meda, bhilla. This verse is quoted as 
Apastamba's by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 265, while Aparftrka p. 1123 
ascribes it to Atri. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 260 distinguishes 
between two groups of antyajas, viz. the one quoted above which 
it says is not so low as another group of seven, which are 
called antyavasayins, m viz. candala, Svapaca ( eater of dog 
flesh ), ksatr, suta, vaidehika, magadha and ayogava. In the 
Mahabharata ( Santi 101. 19 ) reference is made to antyaja 
soldiers and Nllakan^ha explains that they were the kaivartas 
and bhillas of the border regions. According to the Sarasvatl- 
vilasa (p. 74) Pitamaha speaks of the seven castes of rajaka and 
others as prakrtisâ¢ Is it possible that the Prakrta languages 
were originally so called because they were spoken by these 
castes called prakrtis ? In the Sangamner plate of Bhillama 
II dated iake 922 ( E. I. vol. II. p. 220 ) a village is granted 
with eighteen prakrtis ( meaning probably the eighteen guilds 
of washermen and others ). The Vlramitrodaya ( vyavahara 
p. 12 ) explains that Srenis mean the eighteen low castes such 
as the rajaka. This shows that these low castes had risen in 
social status in the medieval ages by their organization and

castes by name as antyajas and adds that all those who eat 
cow's flesh are also antyajas, m 

Antavasayin or Antyavasayin. Manu IV. 79 separately men- 
tions * anfcyas ' and l antyavasayins â¢ and Manu X. 39 says that 
the antyavasayin is the offspring of a candala male from a 
nisada female, that he is condemned even by all * bahyas * 
( untouchables ) and stays in a cemetery. Gautama 20. 1 and 
23. 32 mentions ' antyavasayin ( and -yinl). Vas. Dh. S. 18. 3 
holds that the antyavasayin is the offspring of a sudra from a 
vaisya woman. The Bliaradvaja-srauta sutra ( XI. 22. 12 ) 
forbids the study of the Veda in the presence of the antyava- 
sayin. The Anus&aana-parva ( 22. 22 ) speaks of Medas, Pulkasas 
and Antavasayins ( the printed text is corrrupt ). Santi(141. 
29-32 ) gives a graphic description of a hamlet of candalas and 
calls them 'antyavasaya* ( in verse 41 ). Narada ( rnadana 182 ) 
says that an antyavasayin is not eligible as a witness. Some 
modern works like the Jativiveka (D.O.Ms. No. 347 of 1887-91 ) 
say that Dom in modern times is the antyavasayin of the smrtis. 

Abhisikta â Sae under Murdhavasikta. 

Ambastha â ( same as Bhrj jakantha ). 

In Ait. Br. ( chap. 39. 7 ) king Ambasthya is said to 
have performed an Asvaraedha sacrifice. In Pan. VIII. 3. 97 
the word Ambastha is derived and on Pan. IV. 1. 170 Ambasthya 
( king ? ) is cited by Pat. as an example derived from Ambastha 
( a country ). It is a question whether the caste of Ambasthas 
derived its name from a country. Karnaparva ( 6. 11 ) mentions 
a king Ambastha. In Baud. Dh. S. I. 9. 3, Manu X. 8, Yaj. I. 91 f 
Usanas 31, Narada ( strlpumsa v. 107 ) Ambastha is an anuloma 
sprung from the marriage of a brahmana with a vaisya woman, 
while according to Gautama 4. 14 as interpreted by Haradatta 
he is the offspring of a ksatriya from a vaisya woman. Manu 
X. 47 prescribes the profession of medicine for him and 
Usanas m ( 31-32 ) says that he may subsist by agriculture or 
may be a fire-dancer or he may be a herald ( ? banner procl aimer)

words ; the Sahyadri-khanda ( 26. 40-41 ) says the same. 
Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 14 says that ambastha and 
salyakrnta are synonymous. The Baidyas of Bengal came to be 
the amba$thas of Manu (vide Risley's 'People of India' p. 114). 

Ayaskara ( blacksmith ). In the Vedic literature we have 
ayastapa ( heater of ayas, probably any metal ). Vide under 
karmakara and karmSra. Pafcanjali on Pan. II. 4. 10 mentions 
him as a siidra along with taksan (MahabhSsya, vol. I. p. 475 ). 

Avarita. Devala quoted by Apararka ( p. 118 on Yaj. I. 92 ) 
says that he is born of the illegitimate connection between a 
married woman and a male of the same caste and he becomes a 
sudra. The Sudra-kamalakara ,75 ( p. 247 ) cites from the Smrfci- 
kaumudl a verse of the Adityapurana to the same effect. 

Avira. According to the Sutasarhhita he is the offspring of 
a clandestine union between a ksatriya male and a vai6ya 
female. 

Aptta. According to the Sutasarhhita he is the offspring of 
brahmana from a Dausyantl. 

Abhira. According to Manu X. 15 he is the child of the 
union of a brahmana with an ambastha girl. The Mababharata 
( Mausalaparva 7. 46-63 and 8. 16-17 ) states that the abhlras 
were dasyus and mlecclias who attacked Arjuna after the great 
war in the land of the five rivers and carried away Vrsni 
women. The Sabhaparva ( 51. 12 ) mentions abhlras with 
Paradas and the Asramedhika ( 29. 15-16 ) says ( just as Manu 
X. 43-44 do) that the Abhlras, the Dravidas and others became 
6iidras by non-contact with brahmanas. The Mahabhasya 
expressly states that the abhlras are not a subcaste included 
tinder the genus 6udra but that they are a caste distinct from 
6iidras. m The Kamasutra ( V. 5. 30 ) names an abhira king 
Kottaraja. Dandin in his Kavyadar&a ( I. 36 ) says that Apa-

that the abhira wife of a Mahasudra is called Abhlrl. The 
Abhlras became absorbed in Hindu society and we find that an 
Abhira senapati Rudrabhuti in the year 103 ( 181-82 A. D. ) 
under king Rudrasirhha, son of Rudradaman, built a well ( E. 
I. vol. 16 p. 235 ) and in the Nasik cave No. 15 there is an 
inscription of king tsvarasena, a son of Abhira Sivadatta and 
Madharl ( i. e. the mother was of the Mathara gotra ). Vide E.

According to Gaut. IV. i5> Visnu Dh. S. 16. 4 t Manu X. 12, 
Kaut. III. 7, Anusasana 48. 13, Yaj. I. 94 this is a pratiloma 
caste sprung from the union of a sudra male and a vaisya 
female; while Baud. Dh, S. (I. 9. 7), Usanas 12, Vaik. 
X. 14 say that it springs from the union of a vaisya male and a 
ksatriya female. Vas. Dh. S, ( 18. 3 ) gives antyavasayin as the 
name of the caste sprung from a Sudra male and a vaisya female 
and pulkasa as the name of one sprung from a vaisya male and 
a ksatriya female. His avooation (Manu X. 48) is to pare wood, 
while Usanas ( verse 13 ) says he is a weaver or subsists by 
making vessels of bronze or by cultivating paddy or by dealing 
in cloth. According to Visnu Dh. S, 16. 8 and Agnipurana 
( 151. 15 ) he is to make his living by going to the stage. The 
Sahyadrikhanda says ( 26. 68-69 ) that he works in stones and 
brickB, makes pavements and whitewashes walls i. e. he is the 
modern Patharvata ( in the Deccan ). 

Avantya. Same as Bhurjakan^ha ( Manu X. 21 ). 

Aivika. According to Vaik. X. 12 he is the child of a 
clandestine union between a ksatriya male and a vaisya female 
and deals in horses. 

Ahw<jika. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring of a 
nis&da male from a vaidehl female i. e. he is a double pratiloma 
caste. Kulluka says that his avocation according to Usanas 
is to prevent strangers from trespassing on places where offenders 
are kept imprisoned. Manu X. 36 shows that the same caste is 
called Karavara when it follows the craft of a carmakara. 

Ugra. For Vedic reference see above (p. 45). According to 
Baud. Dh. S. (1 9. 5), Manu X.9, Kaut. III.7, Yaj. 1. 92, Anusasana 
48, 7 he is an anuloma offspring of a ksatriya male from a ftudra,

woman, while according to USanas ( verse 41 ) he is the offspring 
of the union of a brahmana with a 6udra woman. The Ap. Dh. S. 
( I. 2. 7. 20 ) allows a pupil to bring wealth from a sudra or an 
ugra when the teacher is in distress or difficulties. Gaut. 4. 14 
( as explained by Haradafcta ) says that ugra is the offspring of 
a vaisya from a Siidra female. The Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 6. 18. 1 ) says 
that a brahmana may accept the gift of money, corn like paddy, 
flesh of deer, house, field, hay for oxen from an ugra. Manu X. 
49 says that the ugra should subsist by catching and killing 
animals that hide in holes, while Usanas ( verse 41 ) states 
that he is to be the staff-bearer of the king and to carry out the 
punishments inflicted on offenders. Vide Vaik. 10. 13. According 
to the Sahyadrikhanda and Sudrakamalakara (p. 255) he is 
called ' Rajputa \ In the Jativiveka ( the D. 0. collection of 
1887-1891 No. 347 ) he is called BavuU 

Udbandhaka. According to U6anas (verse 15 ) he is the 
offspring of the union of a sunika and a ksatriya woman, subsists 
by washing clothes and is an untouchable. Vaik. 10. 15 says 
he is the offspring of a khanaka and a ksatriya woman. 

Upakrusta. According to Asv. sr. sutra (II. 1) he does not 
belong to the dvijatis, but is authorised to perform the vedic 
rite of agnyadheya and the commentary explains that he is a 
vaisya following the profession of a carpenter. 

Odra. Vide Manu X. 43-44. Odra is a country correspond- 
ing more or less to modern Orissa. Most of the names of people 
mentioned in Manu X. 44 are derived from countries. Vide 
note on Khasa (p. 79 ) and see Sabhaparva 51. 23. 

Katakarcu According to USanas ( 45 ) and Vaik. 10. 13 he 
is the offspring of a clandestine union between a vaisya and a 
sudra female. 

Karana* According to Gaut. ( IV. 17 the view of some 
acaryas) and Yaj. I. 92, he is the child of the marriage of a vaisya 
and a sudra woman ( i. e. he is an anuloma ). Manu (X. 22 ) 
says that a ksatriya who is a vratya ( i. e. for whom no 
upamxyana has been performed ) has from a similar woman a 
child variously called Jhalla, Malla, Niccivi ( Licchivi? ), 
Nata, Karana, Khasa, Dravida. Adiparva 115. 43 tells us that 
Dhrfcarastra had from a vaisya female a karana son named 
Yuyutsu. Kslrasvaral on Amara says that karana also denotes 
a group of officers like kayasthas and adhyaksas ( superintend- 
ents ). The. Sahyadrikhanda ( 26. 49-51 ) says he is the same as 



Ch. II ] Varna : karaya 75 

carana or vaifcalika and his business is to sing the praises of 
kings and brahmanas and study the science of erotics. 

Karmakara. Visnu Dh. 8.(51. 14) mentions this caste. 
It is most probably the same as karmara. But Sankha ( prose ) 
quoted by Apararka p. 115 separately mentions in the same 
passage karmakara and karmara. 

Karmara. For vedic references vide ( p. 43 ) above. This 
caste appears in the gana kulaladi ( Pan, IV. 3. 118 ). Manu 
IV. 215 mentions it. In Bengal the Lohar is a scheduled caste 
( vide Sch. C. O. 1936 ). 

Ka/hsyakara. ( modern kamsara in Marathi) Mentioned by 
Narada ( rnadana 274 ) and Visnu Dh. S. X. 4 in connection 
with the balance ordeal. 

Kakavaca. Mentioned in U6anas ( 50 ) as doing the work 
of bringing grass for horses. 

Kamboja. Vide Manu X. 43-44. The country of Kamboja 
was known to Yaska ( Nirukta II. 2 ) and Panini ( IV. 1. 175 ). 
Udyogaparva 160. 103, Drona 121. 13 mention Kambojas with 
Sakas. Vide under Yavana. 

Kaijasthaâ¢ Heated controversies have raged in medi- 
eval and modern times about the origin and status of kayasthas 
and the bitterness is reflected in the decisions of the Indian 
courts also. In Bholanath v. Emperor m the Calcutta High 
Court held that the kayasthas of Bengal were sudras and went 
so far as to hold that a kayastha could marry a Dom female. 
But in Asita Mohan v. Nirode Mohanâ¢ the Privy Council left 
open the question whether the kayasthas of Bengal were 
sudras. On the other hand in Tutsi Ram v. Bihari Lal m and in 
Ishwari Prasad v. Rai Hari Prasad 181 the Allahabad and Patna 
High Courts respectively held that the kayasthas were dvijas 
and not sudras. In Subrao v. Radha 52 Bom. 497 at p. 504-506 
this conflict of decisions is referred to. 

The word kayastha does not occur in the anoient dharma- 
sutras of Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana, or Vasistha nor

to History of Dharmaiaatra [ Ch. II 

in the Manusrarfci. The Visnu Dh. S. VII. 3 defines a public 
document (r&jas&ksika) as one written in the royal oourt or office 
by a k&yastha appointed by the king and attested by the hand 
of the superintendent of the office. 188 These words suggest that 
the k&yastha was an officer and that there is nothing about a caste 
here. Yaj. I. 322 calls upon the king to protect the subjects 
from the harassment of ca^as ( rogues ), thieves, bad characters, 
desperadoes and the like and particularly of kayasthas. The 
Mit. explains that kayasthas are accountants and soribes, are 
favourites of the king and very cunning. Usanas m ( 35 ) 
holds the kayasthas to be a caste and gives an uncomplimen- 
tary derivation of the name by saying that it is compounded of 
the first letters of Jcaka ( crow ), Yama and sthapati to convey the 
three attributes of greed, cruelty and the spoliation ( or paring ), 
characteristic of the three. The Veda-Vyasa smrti 184 ( 1. 10-11) 
includes the kayastha among sftdras along with barbers, potters 
and others. j3umantu quoted in the Par. M. II part I p. 383 
makes the food of a lekhaka along with that of oilmen and 
others unfit for a brihmana 185 . Lekhaka is obviously a caste 
here, but whether it is the kayastha caste is doubtful. Brhas- 
pati as quoted in the Smrfcicandrikft ( vyavahara ) speaks of the 
ganaka and lekhaka as two persons to be associated with a 
judge in a court of justice and says they were to be dvijas. Vide 
also Apararka p. 600. Therefore both these were only officers and 
not members of a particular caste. In the Mrochakatfka (Act IX) 
a sresthin and kayastha are associated with the judge. So the 
k&yastha seems to be the same as the lekhaka of Brhaspati and 
as a mere official. In the first centuries of the Christian era the 
k&yastha was merely an officer and the word was possibly derived 
from or is a Sanskrit approximation of some foreign word for 
an officer, though in some parts of the country ( as shown by 
Usanas and Veda-Vyasa ) the kayasthas also had come to form 
a caste in medieval times.

Cb. II ] Varnai kayastha 77 

Though numerous officers are mentioned in the inscriptions 
of the first five or six centuries of the Christian era, the kayastha 
hardly ever figures among them. One of the earliest inscrip- 
tions where the word kayastha occurs is the Kanaswa Inscription 
of Sivagana dated in the Malava era 795 ( i. e. 738-39 A. D. ). 
Vide I. A. vol. 19 pp. 56 and 59. See also E. I. vol. X. p. 79 for 
Kayastha Kaficana in Balera plates in 994-95 A. D., E. I. vol. XL 
p. 149 for Sasanika kayastha in Naraspatam plates of 1045-46 
A. D., E. L vol. XI. p. 20, 25 for kayastha Suraditya who was 
'TSarvasastravifc ' in Govindacandra's plate dated 1129-30 A. D., 
E.I. 19 pp.209, 213 Amoda plate dated 1161 A. D. (for Vastavya 
kfiyastha ), E. I. vol. 19 p. 45 Inscription of Hammlra ( dated 
1288-89 A. D. ), E. I. XII. p. 46 ( dated 1328-29 A. D. for 
Matbura kayastha ), E. I, 20 Appendix No. 442 p. 64 ( for Gauda 
kayastha ). In the RajataranginI ( VIII. 131 ) kayasthas and 
diviras are mentioned separately and in VIII. 2383 it is stated 
that the brahmana Sivaratha, who was a roguish kayastha, was 
strangulated in the reign of Jayasimha. So in the 12th century 
kayasthas were only officers in Cashmir and brahmanas held 
such offices. Vide RajataranginI V. 180-184 for a bitter diatribe 
against kayasthas. 

The Sudrakamalakara ( pp. 279-280 ) speaks of three sub - 
castes of kayasthas. 

Karavara. According to Manu X. 36 he is a doubly mixed 
caste sprung from the union of a nisada with a vaidehl and his 
craft is that of a carmakara. According to later digests like the 
Sudrakamalakara he is called ' kahara ' or * bhoi ' and holds 
torches and carries umbrellas for others. 

Karusa. According to Manu X. 23 this caste springs from 
the union of a vratya vaisya and a similar female. This caste 
is also called Sudhanvacarya, Vijanman, Maitra and Satvata 
( according to Manu ). 

Kirata. Vide above (p. 44) for vedic references. Veda-Vyasa 
speaks of him as a subdivision of sudra ( note 184 ). According 
to Manu ( X. 43-44 ) he is a ksatriya reduced to the status of a 
siidra. Anusasana ( 35.17-18 ) says the same about Mekalas, 
Dravidas, La^as, Paundras, Yavanas and others. Karnaparva 
73. 20 speaks of kiratas as men of fiery valour. Asvamedhika 
73. 25 shows that Arjuna met kiratas, yavanas and Mlecchas 
when proceeding to the north with the Asvamedha horse. The 
Amarakosa says that kirata, sabara and pulinda are subdivi- 
sions of Mleooha castes. 



78 History of Dharmaiastra [ ChÂ» II 

Kukkuta, According to Baud. .Dh. S. I. 8. 8 he is a pratiloma 
caste, but 1. 9. 15 says that he is the child of the union of a sudra 
with a nisada woman, while 1.8. 12 states that he is the offspring 
of a vaisya from a nisada woman. ,88 Manu X. 18 agrees with 
Baud. Dh. I. 9. 15. According to Kaut. III. 7 he is the offspring of 
an ugra male from a nisada female. According to Adityapurana 
quoted in the Sudrakamalakara he manufactures swords and 
other weapons and engages in cockfights for the king. 

Kunda. According to Manu III. 174 he is the offspring of 
a clandestine intercourse between a married brahmana woman 
whose husband is living and a brahmana male. 

Kukunda, According to the Sutasamhita he is the offspring 
of a magadha from a sudra female. 

Kumbhakara. This word occurs in the gana kulaladi 
( Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). Usanas ( 32-33 ) says that he is the 
offspring of the clandestine union of a brahmana with a 
vaisya female. Vaik. ( X. 12 ) agrees with Usanas and adds 
that the offspring becomes either a kumbhakara or a barber 
who shaves parts of the body above the navel. Veda-Vyasa 
( I. 10-11 ) and Devala ( quoted in Par. M. II. 1. p. 431 and Gr. 
B. p. 337 ) include the potter among sudras. 187 In the Central 
Provinces the Kumbhara is a scheduled caste. 

Kulala. For Vedic references see above (p.43). Pan IV. 3. 118 
explains the formation of kaulalakam ( made by a potter ). The 
A6v. Gr. IV. 3. 18 says that all earthen vessels ( kaulalam ) of 
a deceased agnihotrin should be kept by his son. Why two 
names arose for the caste of potters it is difficult to explain. 

Kulika. This caste is mentioned in Sahkha quoted by 
Apararka p. 1175 ( where Apararka explains it as devalaka ). 

Ku&ilava* According to Baudhayana as quoted in the 
Krtyakalpataru he is the offspring of an ambastha from a 
vaidehaka female. According to Amara he is the same as a 
earana ( a- bard ). According to Kaut. ( III. 7 ) he is the offspring 
of a vaidehaka male from an ambastha female ( i. e. exactly the 
reverse of Baudhayana's view ) and he gives the name vaina to 
the offspring of an ambastha male from a vaidehaka female.

Ch. II ] Varna : krla, kaivarta Sec, 79 

Krta. According to Gaut. IV. 15 he is the offspring of a 
vaisya from a brahmana woman. Yaj. I. 93 and others call this 
caste vaidehaka. 

Kaivarta. In the Assam valley kaibartta is a scheduled 
caste. Vide under antyaja (p. 70 ) above. Medhatithi on Manu 
X. 4 says that this is a mixed caste. Manu X. 34 tells us that 
the inhabitants of ArySvarta employ the name kaivarta to denote 
the offspring of a nisada from an ayogava woman, who is also 
called mSrgava and dasa ( dasa? ) and who subsists by plying 
boats. Sarhkara on Vedantasutra II. 3. 43 says that dasa and 
kaivarta are the same. Fick p. 302 notes that fishermen who work 
with nets and baskets were called in the Jatakas kevatta. 

Kolika. Mentioned as one of the antyajas by Veda-Vyasa. 
Vide note 173 under antyaja. Koli is a scheduled caste in the 
Central Provinces and Kol in United Provinces. 

Ksatr. For vedic references see above. According to Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 9. 7, Kaut. ( III. 7 ), Manu X. 12, 13 and 16, Yaj. I. 94, 
Narada ( strlpumsa 112 ), this is a pratiloma caste sprung from 
a sudra father and ksatriya mother. Manu ( X. 49-50 ) pres- 
cribes for him the same avocation as for ugra and pulkasa. 
Vas. Dh. S. 18. 2 calls him vaina. In the Amarakosa ksatr is 
given three meanings, a charioteer, doorkeeper and the caste 
described above. In Chandogya Up. IV. 1. 5, 7, 8 the word 
seems to mean only door-keeper. Pan. notices the word (VI. 4. 11). 
The Sahyadrikhanda ( 26. 63-66 ) says that ksatr is also called 
nisada and that he is an expert in catching deer by means of 
nets, is a forester and kills wild animals, also rings a bell at 
night to remind people of the hour. 

Khanaka. According to Vaik. ( X. 15 ) he is the offspring of 
an ayogava male and ksatriya female and lives by digging. 

Kha&a or khasa. According to Manu X. 22 this is another 
name for karana ; while in X. 43-44 he makes the khasas a 
ksatriya caste originally but reduced to the status of sudras by 
the absence of samskaras and the absence of contact with 
brfthmanas. Vide Sabba. 52. 3, Udyoga 160. 103. 

Ouhaka. According to the Sutasarhhita he is the offspring 
of a svapaca from a brahmana female. 

Qoja (or Goda). According to Usanas ( 28-29 ) he is the 
offspring of a clandestine union between a ksatriya male and 
female. 



80 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. II 

Gopa. Vide note 184. He is the modern Gavli and a 
sfidra subcaste, YSj. II, 48 says that debts contracted by gopa 
wives must be paid by their husbands as the latter*s profession 
and earnings depend upon them. The Kamasutra ( I. 5, 37 ) 
mentions a caste called Gopalaka. 

Golaka. He is the offspring of a clandestine intercourse 
between a brahmana widow and a brahman* male. Vide Manu 
III. 174, Laghu-Satatapa 105, Sufcasarhhita ( Siva. 12. 12 ), 

Cakru According to Usanas ( 22-23 ) he is the offspring of a 
clandestine union between a sQdra male and a vaisya female 
and subsists by ( selling ) oil and oilcakes or salt. He seems to 
be the same as tailika. Harlta ( quoted by Apararka p. 279 ) 
mentions him. According to Brahmapurana quoted by Aparftrka 
p. 1177 he is one who presses sesame. According to Vaik. (X. 13) 
he is the offspring of a secret love affair between a vaisya 
male and a brahmana female and engages in the sale of salt 
and oil. 

Carmakara. Vide under antyaja ( p. 70 ) above. He is men- 
tioned in many smrtis like Visnu Dh. S. ( 51.8 ), Apastamba ( in 
verse 9. 32), Paraiara (VI. 44). According to Usanas (4), he is the 
offspring of a sudra from a ksatriya girl, while verse 21 says 
that those sprung from a vaidehaka and a brahmana girl 
subsist by working on hides. Vaik. (X. 15 ) agrees with 
this latter. Manu IV. 218 speaks of him as carmavakartin 
( cutter of hides ). According to several smrfcis he is one of the 
seven antyajas. According to the Sutasamhita he is the offspring 
of an ayogava from a brahmana female. This name persists 
to this day as cambhar ( in Western India ) or camar in all 
other Indian provinces. This caste is often spoken of as Mochi 
( shoe-maker ). Often the mochis are Moslems. This is an 
untouchable caste and the population of oarmakaras in India is 
very large. In the Bombay Presidency alone they are about 
two hundred and ninety thousand ( in 1931 ). 

Cakrika. According to Amara he is a person who rings a 
bell. KslrasvamI says that he announces the king's arrival by 
ringing bells and that some regard him as the same as vaitalika. 
According to Sankha ( prose ) and Sumantu quoted by Apararka 
( pp. 1175-76 ) cakrika and tailika are separate subcastes. 
According to Vaik. ( X. 14 ) he is the offspring of a love affaii 
between a sudra male and a vaisya female and his avocation 
is the sale of salt, oil and oil cakes. 



Oh, II ] Varya : candala 81 

Candala ( or candala ). For Vedio references see above pp. 
44-45. Ace. to Gaufc.IV. 15-16, Vas. Dh. S. 18. 1, Baud. Dh. S. I. 
9. 7, Manu X. 12, Yaj. I. 93, Anusasana 48. 11 he is a pratiloma 
caste sprung of a sudra from a brahmana woman. He is the 
lowest among men ( Manu X. 12 ), beyond the pale of religious 
observances prescribed for the four varnas ( sarvadharma-bahi- 
skrta, as Yaj. I. 93 says ) and often spoken of in the same breath 
with dogs and crows ( e. g. Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 5, Gaut. 15. 25, 
Yaj. I. 103 ). 188 The word occurs in the kulaladi gana ( Pan. IV. 
3. 118 ). Veda-Vyasa-smrti ( I, 9-10 ) says that there are three 
kinds of candalas. viz. the offspring of a sudra from a brahmana 
woman, the offspring of an unmarried woman, the offspring of a 
union with a sagotra girl. Yama quoted in Par. M. vol. II. part 1 
p. 306 says that one born of a person who after becoming an 
ascetic turns back to the householder's life, one born of a 
sagotra woman and one who is the offspring of a sudra from a 
brahmana woman are all candalas. Laghu-Safcatapa ( 59 ) has a 
similar verse. Manu (X- 51-56) says that candalas and svapacas 
should have their houses outside the village, vessels used by 
them cannot be used by others ( even after putting them in fire ), 
their wealth consists of dogs and asses, their clothes should be 
the garments on corpses, they should take their food in broken 
vessels, their ornaments were to be made of iron, they should 
incessantly roam, they are not to enter towns and villages at 
night, they have to carry the corpses of persons who have no 
relatives, they are to be hangmen when the king so orders, they 
may take the clothes, ornaments and l>eds of persons that are 
to be hanged. Usanas (9-10) says that their ornaments are to be 
of lead or iron, they should have a leather thong round their 
necks or a cymbal under their armpits, they should remove the 
dirt of the village in the first part of the day. According to Visnu 
Dh. S. 16.11 and 14 their avocation is to be hangmen or to kill 
those offenders who are condemned to death and candalas have 
to stay outside the village and to wear the clothes on corpses. 
Santi 141. 29-32 gives a graphic description of their hamlet. The 
classical description of a candala hamlet is in the Kadambarl 
of Bana. In Anusasana ( 29,17 ) Matanga is called a candala 
because he was born of a brahmana woman from a barber. 

Fa Hien ( 405-411 A. D. ) describes how candalas had to 
live apart and give notice of their approach when entering a

town or market place by striking a piece of wood to make 
themselves known so that a man may avoid them and not 
come in contact with them (vide 'Record of Buddhist kingdoms' 
tr. by Legge, p. 43 ). In modern times candalas are returned as 
a scheduled paste in Madras and Orissa. 

Cina. According to Manu X. 43-44 the Clnas were a ksatriya 
caste reduced to the status of 6udras. They are frequently named 
in the Mahabharata e. g. Sabha 51. 23, Vanaparva 177. 12, 
Udyoga 19. 15. N 

CuUcu, According to Manu X. 48 the avocation of Meda, 
Andhra, Cuficu and Madgu is to kill forest ( or wild ) animals. 
Kulluka says that he U the offspring of a brahmana from a 
vaidehaka woman. 

Cuculca. According to Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring of the 
marriage of a vaisya with a sudra woman and his avocation is 
the sale and purchase of betelnut, betelnut leaves and sugar. 

Cailanirnejaka (or only nirnejaka)-washerman. Thi-i occurs 
in Visnu Dh. S. 51. 15 and Manu IV. 216. It appears that 
Visnu who separately mentions * rajaka ' ( in 51. 13 ) distingui- 
shes between the two. Harlfca ( quoted in Apararka p. 279 ) also 
distinguishes between * rajaka ' ( one who dyes clothes ) from 
* nirnejaka ' ( one who washes clothes ). Very often * rajaka ' 
means only * a washerman * ( as Amara says ). 

Jalopajlvin â ( subsisting by catching animals in a net ) 
probably the same as a kaivarta. He is] mentioned in Harlta 
quoted by Apararka p. 279. 

Jhalla. Manu X. 22 says that it is another name for 
Karana and Khasa. In Bengal Jhalo Malo or Malo is returned 
as a scheduled caste. 

Dornba (or Doma) is the same as ivapaca according to Kslra- 
svaml on Amara. Parasara quoted by Apararka ( p. 1197 ) puts 
svapaka, domba and candala on the same level. In the Rajatar- 
aiiginl ( V. 354, VI. 182, VI. 192 ) dombas are spoken of as untou- 
chables on the same level with candalas and as following the 
profession of singers. In RajataranginI V. 289-394 dombas are 
spoken of as svapacas. This caste is returned as a scheduled 
caste in Madras as Dombo, as Dom in Bengal, Bihar and U. P. 

Taksan or Taksaka ( carpenter ). For vedic references 
see above ( p. 43 ). He is the same as vardhaki quoted above, 
under kayasfcha. He is mentioned by Manu IV. 210, Visnu 
Dh. S. 51. 8. According to the Mahabhasya on Pan. II* 4. 10 



Ch. II ] Varna : taksan 83 

the taksan is a sudra and on the same level with an ayas- 
kara ( ironsmifch ) and excluded from sacrificial rites. Even 
so early as the Sat. Br. the taksan was an unholy person 
( amedhya ) and his touch made yajrlapatras impure ( I. 1. 3. 12 ). 
Usanas 43 says that taksaka is the offspring of a brahmana 
female from a sucaka ( i. e. he is a pratiloma ). He must be 
supposed to be originally different from the rathakara ( vide Tai. 
S. quoted above p. 43 ) who was allowed the vedic rite of adhana 
or probably in the time of the smrtis the carpenter lost his 
former status. According to Vaik. (X. 14 ) 189 the offspring of a 
brahmana girl from a cucuka ( sucaka ? ) is a taksaka who 
is untouchable or a goldsmith or blacksmith or worker in 
bell-metal. Brhaspati names the taksaka as one whose food 
a brahmana could not eat. 

Tantuvaija ( a weaver ), also called kuvinda. He is men- 
tioned in Visnu Dh. S. (51. 13 ) and Sankha quoted by Apararka 
p. 1175. He is regarded as a sudra by the Mahabhasya on 
Pan, II. 4. 10 and as excluded from sacrificial rites. 

TambuUka â seems to have been a caste. Vide Kamasutra 
I. 5. 37. Bana refers to his house as stored with spices and betel. 

Tamropajliin (coppersmith). According to Usanas (14) he is 
the offspring of an ayogava from a brahmana woman. Vaik, 
( X. 15 ) says the same and calls him tamra. The Jativiveka 
( D. C. No. 347 of 1887-91 ) gives the name as tamra-kuttaka. 

Tunnavaya ( a tailor ). He occurs in Manu IV. 214. 
According to the Brahmapurana quoted uy Apararka p. 1178 he 
is the same as suci ( or saucika ). 

Tailika ( oilman )-occurs in Visnu Dh. S. ( 51. 15 ), Sankha 
and Sumantu quoted by Apararka ( pp. 1175 and 1176 ). 

Darada. Manu X. 44 names him. Vide note on khasa 
above p. 79. Vide Mahabharata, Udyogaparva 4. 15. 

Dasa ( a fisherman ). This occurs in an Upanisad passage 
according to Vedanta-sutra II. 3. 43. Veda-Vyasa (1.12-13) 
includes him among antyajas (vide footnote 173). Manu X. 34 
says that margava, dasa ( dasa ? ) and kaivarta are the same and 
that he subsists by plying boats. Pan. ( III. 4. 73 ) derives the 
word. Vide under kaivarta.

Divaklrlya â occurs in Manavagrhya II. 14. 11. According 
to Araara both candala and napifca are called divaklrti. 

Daasmanta. According to Gaut. 4. 14 this is an anuloma 
caste sprung from the union of a ksatriya male and a sudra 
female. According to the Sutasarhhita the name is Dau^yanta. 

Dravida* The same as karana, according to Manu X. 22. 
According to Manu X. 43-44, this is a ksatriya caste reduced 
to the status of a sudra. Vide under khasa, and Mahabharata, 
Udyoga 160. 103, Drona 93. 43. 

Dhigvana. According to Manu X. 15 he is the offspring of a 
brahmana male from an ayogava female and according to 
Manu X. 49 he subsists by working on ( and sale of ) hides, 
Kulluka on Manu X. 49 quotes a text of Usanas that Dhig- 
vanas subsist by working on hides and selling them and distin- 
guishes them from karavaras. This passage is not found in 
the printed text of Usanas. In the Jativiveka he is styled 
Moclkara. 

Dhivara. Same as kaivarta and dasa. Gaut. ( IV. 17 ) 
indicates that this is a pratiloma caste sprung from a vaisya 
male and a ksatriya female ( according to the view of some 
teachers ). In the Tai. Br. III. 4. 12 Dhaivara, Dasa and Kaivarta 
are separately mentioned, but how they were distinguished it is 
difficult to say. All caught fish in different ways. Dhimar is a 
scheduled caste in the Bhandara District of C. P. 

Dhvaji ( seller of wines ) â mentioned by Sumantu and 
Harlta quoted by Apararka p. 1176. The Brahmapurana quoted 
by Apararka ( p. 1177 ) says he is the same as saundika. 

Nata. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170 
above), Nata is a scheduled caste in Bengal, Bihar, U. P. and 
Punjab. Harlta quoted by Apararka ( p. 279 ) distinguishes 
between nata and sailusa and Apararka remarks that nata is a 
specific oaste, while sailusa is one who though not a na^a by caste 
makes a living by going on the stage. Manu X. 22 says that he 
is the same as karana, khasa ( vide note on khasa p. 79 ). Panini 
knew of a Na^asutra composed by Silalin and another by 
Krsasva ( IV. 3. 110 and 111 ), but whether the na^as he meant 
were so by caste or whether he meant only actors in general is 
not clear. Vide under rangavatarin for a quotation from Maitrl 
Up. Probably this caste is the same as the Kolhatis or Bahu- 
rupls of modern times ( in the Deccan ) who are dancers, 
acrobats and jugglers by profession. Fick's work p. 299 speaks 



Ch. II ] Varna : nata 85 

of natakakula3 mentioned in Buddhist; Jatalcas and at; p. 294 he 
shows that in the Suruci Jataka the nata is described as throw- 
ing up a ball of rope and climbing it and performing other 
tricks of jugglery. 

Nartaka. According to Usanas (19) he is the offspring of a 
ranjaka from a vaisya woman and his profession is that of a 
singer. Brhaspati quoted in Par. M. ( II. part I p. 380 ) sepa- 
rately mentions in the same verse nata and narfcaka ( both 
being abhojyanna to a brahmana ). Atri VII. 2 also mentions 
the two separately. See note 189. 

Napita (barber). The Sankhayana grhya I. 25 refers to him 
(in cudakarma). Usanas (32-34) and Vaik. (X. 12) say that he 
is the offspring of a clandestine affair between a brahmana male 
and a vaisya female and Usanas derives the word by saying 
that he shaves the body above the navel of a person. 190 Vaik. 
( X. 15 ) says that the offspring of an ambas^ha male from a 
ksatriya female is a napita, but he shaves the hair on the body 
below the navel. Parasara ( XI. 21 ) 191 says that the offspring 
of a brahmana from a siidra girl is called dasa if samskaras 
are performed on him, but if they are not performed he be- 
comes a napita. Pan. ( VI. 2. 62 ) specially provides for the 
accentuation of words meaning artisan ( silpin, like napita or 
kulala ) when compounded with the word grama. The Sutasam- 
hita (Siva â chap. XII. 15) says that the offspring of the 
clandestine union of a brahmana male and aÂ« vaisya female is 
called kumbhakara or urdhva-napita, while verse 32 says that 
the offspring of a ksatriya female from a nisada is called 
4 adho-napita \ 

Nicchiw, Manu X. 22 says that this is another name for 
karana or khasa. Probably tuis is a misreading for Licchavi 
or Licchivi. Kaut. (Artbasastra XI. 1) speaks of the oligarchies 
or corporations of Licchivika, Vrjika, Mallaka 192 etc. Vaisali 
was the seat of this oligarchy in the 6th century B, C. (Rapson's 
4 Ancient India ' p. 169 ). Vide Indian Antiquary vol. 32 p. 233 
for their Tibetan affinities and I. A. vol. 9 p. 178 and vol. 14

Quarterly/ 1933, vol. 18 p. 439 ff. Fa Hien ( in ' Records of 
Buddhist Kingdoms ' translated by Legge, 1886, p. 71 ) says that 
the Licchavis of Vaisali were attached to Buddha and also 
speaks of Ananda ( pupil of Buddha ) and the Licchavis. 

Niasda. For vedic references see above ( pp. 43 and 46 ). 
The Nirukta 193 III. 8 while explaining the words ' pancajana 
mama hotram jusadhvam * in Rg. X. 53. 4 remarks that according 
to Aupamany ava the ' five people ' are the four varnas with nisada 
as the fifth. This shows that Aupamanyava regarded them as 
distinct from the four varnas (including the sudras). The 
Nirukta further says that according to the Nairuktas the 
nisada is so called because ' sin ( or evil ) sits down in him ' ; 
from this it follows that in the times of Yaska the nisadas had 
come to be looked down upon with scorn as evil people and 
were probably some aborigines like the modern Bhils. Accord- 
ing to Baud, Dh. S. ( I. 9.3 and II. 2.33 ), Vas. 18.8, Manu X. 8, 
Anusasana 48.5, Yaj. I. 91 the Nisada is an anuloma caste, 
offspring of the marriage of a brahmana with a sudra woman. 
Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 2.34 ), Kaut. ( III. 7 ), Manu ( X. 8 ) and Yaj. 
( I. 91 ) say that parasava is another name for nisada. Manu 
( IX. 178 ) derives parasava from the root paray ( to go across ) 
and the word sava ( a corpse ) meaning ' though living he is like 
one dead \ In a corrupt passage of Vas. Dh. S. m ( 18. 9-10 ) 
the same derivation is accepted. Gaut. ( IV. 14 ) distinguishes 
between nisada and parasava, the former ( aco. to the com. 
Haradatta ) boing the offspring of a brahmana from a vaisya 
woman and the latter being the offspring of a brahmana male and 
a sudra female. According to Narada ( sfcrlpumsa v. 108 ) and 
Anusasana 48.12, nisada is the offspring of a ksatriya male and a 
sudra female and he subsists by fishing (according to the latter). 
Narada ( strlpurhsa 108 ) says that parasava is the offspring of a 
brahmana male and a sudra female. Usanas ( 36-38 ) says that 
the offspring of the marriage of a brahmana with a sudra 
woman is called parasava and gains his livelihood as the 
worshipper of the goddess Bhadrakall or by learning Saiva 
agamas or by playing on musical instruments, while nisada is 
the illegitimate offspring of a brahmana from a sudra woman 
who subsists by killing wild beasts ( such as elephants ) and by

selling flesh. The Vaik. 195 (X. 13) has practically the same 
remarks to make about paraSava and nisada. Santiparva ( 59. 
96-97 ) speaks of nisadas as men with reddish eyes and with 
black hair. In the Ramayana Guha, the king of nisadas, helps 
Rama to cross the river Ganges ( Ayodhya 50. 33 ). Here he is 
spoken of as belonging to the caste of nisadas ( nisadajatyah ). 
We have historical evidence for the name para^ava in the 
Harsacarifca ( I, towards end ), where Bana 198 tells us that he 
had with him two paraSava brothers Candrasena and Matrsena in 
his travels. In the Tipperah copperplate of a chieftain called 
Lokanatha (about 650 A. D.) we are told that the king's maternal 
grandfather Kesava was a parasava ( vide E. I. vol. 15 at p. 307). 
The Mit. on Yaj. I. 91 cautions that this nisada ( the anuloma 
offspring of a brahmana from a sudra woman ) is different from 
another caste called nisada, which is a prafciloma one and lives 
by catching fish. Medhatithi on Manu X, 8 does the same. 
Nisada occurs in the gana kulaladi ( Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). The 
Vayupurana ( vol. IT. chap. 1. 120-121 ) narrates that the nisadas, 
dark and dwarfish, were produced from the left hand of king 
Vena and they dwelt on the Vindhya. In the Bhagavata-purana 
wo have the same story 197 ( IV. 14. 42 ff. ; and we are told that 
nisadas were dark like crows, of short stature, snubnosed, with red 
eyes and hair and that they dwelt in mountains and forests. 

Pahlava. âoccurs in Manu ( X. 43-44 ) as a ksatriya caste 
reduced to the status of &udra. Vide note on khaÂ£a. The 
Mahabharata several times mentions the PahJavas, Paradas 
and other non-Aryan people ( vide Â£Â«,bha 32, 16-17, Udyoga 4, 
15, Bhlsma 20. 13 ). 

Pandusopaka. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring 
of a candala male from a vaidehaka woman, who maintains him- 
self by dealing in bamboos. He is the same as buruda. 

Parada. Vide Manu X, 43-44 and note on khaSa above. 
Paradas are frequently mentioned in the Mahabharata, generally

as Mlecchas and non-Aryan tribes ( vide Sabha 32, 16,51.12, 
52. 3 ; Drona 93. 42 and 121. 13 ). Vide under Yavana. 

Parasava. Vide nisada above. In the Adiparva 109. 25 
Vidura is called parasava and he is said ( in Adi. 114.12 ) to have 
married the parasavl daughter of king Devaka. The Sahyadri- 
khanda ( 26. 43 ) says that he is called sudra and is superior to a 
sudra ( in status ) and that he was to live by the avocations pre- 
scribed for sudras. 

Pingala. According to the Sutasamhita he is the offspring 
of a brahmana from an ayogava female. 

Pundra or Paundraka, Frequently mentioned in the Maha- 
bharata among non-Aryan tribes e. g. Drona 93. 44, Asvame- 
dhika 29. 15-16. Medhatithi on Manu X. 44 remarks that 
the Paundrakas are spoken of as ksatriyas in the Mahabharata, 
so a man may be misled into thinking that even in the days of 
Medhatithi they were still ksatriyas ( but they were not so ). 

Pulinda. For vedic references see above ( p. 47 ). They were 
a wild mountain tribe like the Kiratas or Sabaras. In the Vana- 
parva 140. 25 Pulindas, Kiratas and Tanganas are spoken of as 
dwelling on the Himalaya. Udyoga 160. 103, Kama 73. 19-20, 
Anusasana 33. 21-22 mention pulindas. Usanas ( 16 ) says that 
he is the illegitimate offspring of a vaisya male f ro:n a ksatriya 
female and he lives by rearing cattle and by killing wild 
beasts. Vaik. ( X. 14 ) says the same and adds that he subsists 
on the produce of the forest and by killing wild animals. 
The Sutasamhita is of the same opinion as Vaik. 

Pulkasa (or paulkasa). The word is also written as 
pukkasa. Sarhkaracarya on Brhadaranyaka Up. IV. 3. 22 says 
that pulkasa and paulkasa are the same. According to Baud. 
Dh. S. (1. 9. 14) and Manu X. 18 he is the offspring of a nisada male 
from a sudra female. According to Kaut. ( III. 7 ) he is the 
offspring of a nisada male from an ugra female, while Vaik. 
X. 14, Usanas ( 17 ) and the Sutasamhita say that he is the 
offspring of a sudra male from a ksatriya woman and that he 
makes his livelihood by manufacturing and selling 198 liquors 
or natural intoxicating sap. The same is the view of some 
teachers according to Gautama IV. 17. According to Vas. Dh, S. 
( 18. 5 ) and Visnu Dh. 8. (16. 5 ) he is the offspring of a vaisya 

*nsrnw X. 14. 



Oh. II ] Varna and pulkasa 89 

male from a ksatriya female and the latter adds that he 
subsists by hunting. The Agnipurana ( 151. 15 ) says that 
pukkasas are hunters. Yama m and Harlta quoted in the Krtya- 
kalpataru make him out as the offspring of a 6iidra male from 
a vaiÂ£ya female. Manu X. 49 prescribes catching and killing 
animals that live in holes as the occupation of ksatr, ugra and 
pukkasa. Kslrasvaml ( com. of Amara ) says that pukkasa is the 
same as mrtapa (which see below). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 1. 2.6) 
says that when a Brahmana, Ksatriya or Vaisya is guilty of the 
theft of gold, of the murder of a brahmana, they undergo for 
some time in hell torments and then are respectively born as 
Candala, Paulkasa or Vaina. 

Puskara. Mentioned in Veda-Vyasa-smrti ( I. 12 ) as one 
of the antyajas. Vide note 173 above. 

Puspadha. Manu (X. 21) says that this is another name of 
avantya ( p. 73. ) 

Paundraka ( or Paundra ). Vide Pundra above. AnuSasana 
35. 17 and Santi 65. 13-14 have the form paundra. Vide Manu 
X. 44 for paundraka and note on khaSa. 

Paulkasa. Vide pulkasa above. 

Bandin. See under vandin below. 

Barbara. Medhatithi on Manu X. 4 says that the barbaras 
are samklrnayonis. In the Mahabharata they are frequently 
mentioned among no n- Aryan tribes along with Saka, Sahara, 
Yavana, Pahlava etc. Vide Sabha, 32. 16-17, 51. 23 ; Vana 254, 
18 ( as staying in the west ); Drona 12l. 13 ; Anusasana 35. 17 ; 
Santi 65. 13. 

Bahya. Vide under antya (p. 70). 

Buruda ( worker in bamboo ). He is one of the seven 
antyajas ( vide note 170 above ). The word is also written as 
varuda ( vide below ). Varuda occurs in the Kulaladigana 
( Panini IV. 3. 118 ). Buruda is a scheduled caste in Orissa. 

Bhata. He is one of the antyajas according to Veda-Vyasa 
(1. 12). Vide note 173 above and on rangavatarin below. 

Bhilla. He is one of the antyajas according to Angiras, 
Atri 199, Yama 33. Vide note 170 above. 

Bhisak. According to Usanas (26) he is the offspring of a 
clandestine union between a brahmana and a ksatriya girl

and he maintains himself by studying the Ayurveda in its eight 
parts, or astronomy, astrology and mathematics (verse 27). 
According to Brahmapurana (quoted by Apararka p. 1171) he 
lives by surgery and by attending upon patients. 

Bhupa. According to Yama quoted in Krfcyakalpataru he 
is the offspring of a vaisya from a ksatriya female. 

Bhurjakantaka. According to Manu X. 21 he is the offspring 
of a vratya brahmana from a similar woman. In several coun - 
tries he is called avantya or va^adhana, puspadha or saikha. 

Bhrjjakantha ( same as ambastha ). According to the view 
of some teachers mentioned in Gaut. IV. 17, he is the offspring 
of a brahmana male from a vaisya female. 

Bhoja. According to the Suta-samhita he is the offspring 
of a ksatriya woman and a vaisya male. 

Madgu. Mentioned in Manu X. 48 as subsisting by killing 
wild beasts. Kulluka on that verse explains that according to 
Baudhayana he is the offspring of a brahmana from a bandin 
female. Vaik. X. 12 says that he is the offspring of the 
marriage of a ksatriya male with a vaisya female and subsists 
as a merchant ( sresthin ) and does not take to the profession of 
a warrior. 

Manikara. According to Usanas ( 39-40 ) he is the offspring 
of a clandestine union between a ksatriya male and a vaisya 
female and he gains his livelihood by working on beads, by 
perforating pearls and dealing in coral and conches. According 
to the Sutasamhita he is the clandestine offspring of a vaisya 
male from a vaisya female. 

Matsyabandhaka (a fisherman). According to Usanas (44) he is 
the offspring of a taksaka ( carpenter ) from a ksatriya woman. 

Malta. Vide Manu ( X. 22 ) who says that it is another 
name of Jhalla etc. 

Magadha. According to Gaut. IV. 15, Anusasana 48. 12, 
Kaut. ( III. 7 ), Manu X. 11, 17 and Yaj. I. 93 he is a pratiloma 
caste sprung from the union of a vaisya male and a ksatriya 
female; while according to the view of some teachers mentioned 
in Gaut. IV. 16, Usanas (7) and Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring 
of a vaisya male and a brahman* female; but Baud. Dh. S. I. 9. 7 
says he is the offspring of a sudra male and a vaisya female and 
Visnu Dh. S. 16. 5 makes him the offspring of a sudra from a 
ksatriya female. Manu (X. 47) prescribes trade by land routes for 



Ch. II ] Varna and mctgadha 

Magadhas; Anusasana X. 48 says that they maintain tneraseives 
on speech ( i. e. by praise ) and are also called bandin. Sahya- 
drikhanda ( 26. 60-62 ) also calls him bandin and says he is 
slightly superior to sudra and that he is clever in ornate prose, 
in six languages, in kalas and he is a devotee of Kalika. Vaik. 
(X. 13 ) states that even siidras cannot take food cooked 
by him, that he is an untouchable and maintains himself by 
praise, by singing or by being a messenger. U^anas ( 7-8 ) says 
that he becomes the bandin of brahmanas and ksatriyas, he 
maintains himself by lauding ( the deeds of others ) or as a 
messenger or servant of a vaisya. Panini IV. 1. 70 derives the 
word Magadha from the country Magadha, but apparently not 
in the sense of a caste. 

Manavika. According to the Sutasamhita he is the offspring 
of the clandestine union of a sudra male and a sudra female. 

Matahga. The same as candala. The Kadambarl of Bana 
(para 9) and Amara employ them as synonymous. Yama (12) uses 
the word Matanga where we ordinarily find candala in other 
smrtis. In the Bombay Presidency there is an untouchable 
caste called Mang which numbers about three hundred thousand. 
There are Mangs as a scheduled caste in Orissa. 

Mar-gava. Same as kaivarta (fisherman). Vide Manu X. 34. 

Malakara or Malilca. Vide Veda-Vyasa ( I. 10-11 ) quoted 
above in note 184. 

Mahisya. According to the view of some teachers mentioned 
in Gaut. IV. 17 and Yaj. I. 92 he is an anuloma caste sprung from 
the marriage of a ksatriya with a vaisya woman. According 
to the Sahyadrikhanda ( 26. 45-46 ) he is entitled to upanayana 
and his avocations are astrology, augury, prognostications 
due to svara. According to the Sutasamhita he is the same as 
ambastha. 

Murdhavasikta. This is an anuloma caste according to the 
view of some teachers in Gaut. IV. 17 and Yaj. I. 91 sprung from 
the marriage of a brahmana with a ksatriya woman. According 
to Vaik. (X. 12) the offspring of the marriage of a brahmana with 
a ksatriya woman is the foremost among anulomas and is 
called savarna, while the offspring of the clandestine union of 
these two is called abhisikta. If crowned he becomes a king, 
otherwise he subsists by studying Ayurveda ( Medicine ) or the 
science of ghosts or astronomy, astrology and mathematios. In 
the Sahyadrikhanda ( chap. 26. 36-39 ) more details are added* 



S3 History of Bharmaiastra [ Ch. II 

Mrtapa. Vide pulkasa above. In the Mahabhasya 800 on 
Pan. II. 4. 10 this caste is mentioned as separate from oandala, 
but both are included by the Mahabhasya under sudras that are 
niravasita ( i. e. those who are so low in the caste system that if 
a vessel is used by them for eating their food from it cannot 
be used by any one of the other castes even after the vessel is 
purified by fire &c. ). 

Meda. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170). 
This is mentioned in Narada ( vakparusya, verse 1 1). Anusasana 
22. 22 speaks of raedas, pulkasas and antavesayins, and the 
com. Nllakan^ha 201 explains that Medas are those who eat the 
flesh of dead cattle. Manu X. 36 says that; he is the offspring 
of a vaidehaka male and a nisada woman, that he dwells out- 
side the village and Manu X. 48 says that his business along 
with that of Andhra, Cuficu and Madgu is to kill wild beasts . 
Vide under Andhra above and see E. I. vol. XX. p. 130 where 
meda and candala are named as lowest castes in a grant of 
Paramardideva in samvat 1236. Acoording to Sudrakamalakara, 
andhras and medas have to sweep dirty places, doorsteps 
and privies. 

Maitra. Manu X. 23 says he is the same as Karusa. 

Maitreyaka. According to Manu X. 23 he is the offspring of 
a vaidehaka male and ayogava female and his means of liveli- 
hood are belauding kings and nobles continually and ringing a 
bell in the early morning. The Jativiveka says that he is 
called Dhokanakara. 

Mlecclia. According to the Sutasamhita he is the offspring of 
the clandestine union of a brahmana woman;and a vaisya male. 

Yavana. According to the view of sone mentioned in Gaut. 
IV. 17 he is a pratiloma caste sprung from a sudra male and a 
ksatriya woman. According to Manu X. 43-44 Yavanas were 
originally ksatriyas reduced to the status of sudras ( vide under 
khasa above p. 79 ). In the Mahabharata Yavanas are almost

Sauvlra) had Kamboja and Yavana women in his harem # 
Panini (IV. 1.59) derives the word YavananI from Yavana 
and a vartika on that sutra adds that YavananI means the lipi 
( the written alphabet ) of the Yavanas. Patanjali in his 
Mahabhasya ( on Pan. II. 4. 10 ) indicates that he was prepared 
to regard Yavanas and Sakas as sudras but as outside Arya- 
varta. Asoka in Rock Edicts V and XIII refers to the Yonas 
and Kambojas as nations on the borders of his empire. The 
Visnupurana IV. 3. 21 describes that the Yavanas shaved the 
head and also the beard, the Sakas tonsured their heads only, 
the Paradas allowed the hair on the head to grow long and the 
Pahlavas grew beards and that all became Mlecohas because 
they gave up their original dharmas and because brahmanas 
also left them. 

Raiigavatarin ( ov-taraJca ). According^ to Manu IV. 215 he 
is distinct from sailusa and gayana. Sankha ( quoted by 
Apararka p. 1175 ), Saakha ( 17. 36 ) and Visnu Dh. S. 51. 14 
mention him. According to Brahmapurana (quoted by Apararka 
p. 1178 ) he is a nata who goes on the stage for livelihood and 
who introduces various changes in his appearance and dress. 
Raiigavatarin is mentioned in the Maitrl Up. along with nata 
and bhata. 208 

Rajaka ( washerman ), Dhobl is a scheduled caste in 
U. P., Bihar and C. P. and in Bengal ( called Dhoba). He is one 
of the antyajas according to several writers ( vide note 170 
above). Acoording to Vaikh. (X. 15) and the Sutasarhhita he is the 
offspring of a pulkasa ( or vaideha ) from a brahmana woman, 
while according to Usanas (18) he is the offspring of a pulkasa 
male from a vaisya girl. The Mahabhasya on Pan. ( II. 4. 10 ) 
includes him under sudra. Yaj. II. 48 mentions him as liable 
to pay his wife's debts, because his livelihood depends on her. 
The Sudrakamalakara mentioned another caste of rajaka ( which 
is the offspring of an ugra male and vaidehaka female ).

Eafljaka (dyer). Manu IV. 216 mentions him. According 
to Usanas (19) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between 
a sudra male and a ksatriya female- 

Bathakara. Vide above pp. 43, 45 for Vedic references. 
According to Baud. gr. II. 5. 6 and Bharadvaja gr. (I) his 
upanayana was to be performed in the rainy season. It appears he 
lost his status gradually. In the Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 6 ) he is the 
offspring of the marriage of a vaisya male with a sudra female. 
According to Yaj. I. 95 he is an anuloma doubly mixed as he is 
the offspring of a mahisya male from a karana female and 
according to a prose passage of Sankha quoted by the Mit. 
the rathakara is entitled to have upanavana performed, 
to offer sacrifices and gifts and makes his living by learning 
the art of taming horses, of making chariots and building 
houses. According to Usanas ( 5-6 ) and Vaik. ( X. 13 ) he is the 
offspring of a clandestine union between a ksatriya male 
and a brahmana woman and he is to behave like a sudra, he is 
not a twice-born ( dvija ) and cannot repeat Vedic mantras and 
makes his living by tending and driving horses and carts. 

Ramaka. According to Vas. Dh. S. 18. 4 he is a pratiloma 
sprung from the union of a vaisya male and a brahmana female. 
This would be krta, according to Gaut. ( IV. 15 ), vaidehaka 
according to Baudhayana. 

Lubdhaka ( hunter of deer ) â same as vyadha. 

Lekhaka. Mentioned by Sumantu quoted in Par. M. II. 
part 1 p. 383. He is probably the same as kayastha, if a caste 
is meant ; vide under kayastha pp. 75-76. 

Lohakara (ironsmith). Vide p. 75 under karmara. Narada* 03 
( rnadana 288 ) recommends utilising the services of an ironsmith 
who is so by caste in the fire ordeal. He is mentioned by Harlta 
( prose ) quoted by Apararka p. 1176. The Kamauli plate of 
Jayacandradeva Gahadavala was engraved by ' Lohara Someka ' 
in sarhvat 1232 ( E. I. IV. p. 127 ). 

Vandin ( a bard, written as bandin also ). According to 
HÂ£rlta quoted in Krtyakalpataru he is a pratiloma sprung 
from a vaisya male and ksatriya female. According to the 
Brahma-purana quoted by Apararka p. 1177 a vandin is one who 
sings the praises of men,

Oh. II ] Varna : varata t varuda &c. 95 

Varata. Enumerated among the antyajas by Veda-Vyasa 
( 1. 12-13 ). 

Varuda ( worker in bamboo )â also written as buruda 
( vide aboye p. 89 ). The Mahabhasya on Pan. IV. 1. 97 ( vol. II 
p. 253) gives the instance varufaki ( f rom varuda). Bidala- 
kara ( splitter of bamboo) occurs in Tai. S. III. 4. 5. 1. and 
bidalakarl in Vaj. S. 30. 8. 

Vatadhana. According to Manu X. 21 he is the same as 
avantya. 

Vijanman. According to Manu X.23 he is the same as karusa. 

Vena (or Vaina). According to Manu X. 19 and Baud. DbÂ« 
S. ( I. 9. 13 ) he is the offspring of a vaidehaka male from an 
ambastha female, while Kaut. ( III. 7 ) makes the vaina the 
offspring of an ambastha male from a vaidehaka female; and 
according to Manu X. 49 he makes his livelihood by beating 
musical instruments. Kulluka on Manu IV. 215 says that 
Vena is one who maintains himself by splitting bamboos and 
that he is the same as buruda according to Visvarupa. For 
Vaina see Ap. Dh. S. quoted under pulkasa (p. 89). Kaut. (III. 7) 
adds that a vainya follows the same profession as a rathakara. 
Sankha ( 17. 38 ), Visnu Dh. S. 51. 14, Yaj. III. 207 place the 
vena alongside of carmakara, nisada and pulkasa. According 
to Vas. Dh. S. ( 18. 2) he is a pratiloma sprung from the union 
of a sudra male and a ksatriya female. Yaj. I. 161 has the form 
vaina which the Mit. explains as meaning one who maintains 
himself by cutting and splitting bamboos. The Sudrakamalakara 
notes that according to Adipurana vena is a drum-beater to 
announce royal orders and edicts. 

Venuka. According to Usanas (4) he is a pratiloma, the 
offspring of a suta from a brahmana woman, while according to 
Vaik. (X. 15 ) he is the offspring of a madgu from a brahmana 
woman and his avocation is to play on a vlna and on 
flutes. According to the Sutasarhhita he is the offspring of a 
barber from a brahmana woman. 

Velava. According to the Sutasarhhita he is the offspring 
of a sudra from a ksatriya woman by stealth. 

Vaidehaka. According to Baud. Dh. ( 1. 9. 8 ), Kaut. ( III. 7 ), 
Manu X. 11,13, 17, Visnu Dh. S. 16. 6, Narada (strlpumsa 
111), Yaj. I. 93, Anusasana 48. 10 he is a pratiloma sprung 
from a vaisya male and a brahmana female ; while according to 
Gaut. IV. 15 he is the offspring of a sudra from a ksatriya 
woman and acoording to Vaik. (X 14), the view of some acSryas 



96 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. II 

in Gaut. IV. 17 and Usanas (20) he is the offspring of 
a sudra male from a vaisya female. According to Manu X. 47 
and Agnipurana (151. 14) his peculiar work is to attend on and 
guard women ( in harems etc ), while according to Usanas 
( 20-21 ) and Vaik. ( X. 14 ) he is to tend goats, cows and 
buffaloes and to sell milk, curds, butter-milk and ghee. The 
Suta-samhita says that vaideha and pulkasa are the same. 

Vyadha ( huntsman )-mentioned by Sumantu in Apararka 
p. 1176 and Harlta ( quoted by Apararka p. 279 ), Apastamba 
(verse) 9. 32,Yaj. II. 48. 

Vratya. According to Ap, Dh. S. 1. 1, 1. 22-1. 1. 2. 10, Par. gr. 
II. 5 and other sutra works a vratya is one on whom and on 
whose ancestors the samskara of upanayana has not been per- 
formed. But in other works like Baud. Dh. S, (I. 9. 15), the word 
vratya is applied to all who are born of the mixture of varnas. 

&aka. Manu ( X. 43-44 ) mentions Sakas along with Yava- 
nas and others as originally ksatriyas reduced to the state of 
sudras. Vide note on Yavana (p. 92) above. They are mentioned 
in the Mahabharata along with Yavana and other no n- Aryan 
tribes. Vide Sabha 32. 16-17, 51. 23, Udyoga (4. 15; 19. 21; 
160. 103 ), Bhlsma ( 20. 13 ), Drona ( 121. 13 ). Saka occurs in 
the kambojadigana ( Pan. IV. 1. 175 ). Vide note 200. 

Sahara. An aboriginal jungle tribe like the Bhilla. In the 
Mahabharata the sabaras are frequently mentioned ( e. g. 
Anusasana 35. 17, Santi 65. 13 ). 

Salika. According to the Sutasamhita he is the same as 
Magadha. 

&ulika. According to Usanas ( 42 ) he is the offspring of a 
clandestine union between a brahmana and a sudra female and 
his avocation is to impale those offenders who are sentenced to 
be impaled. According to Vaik. ( X. 13 ) and Sutasamhita he is 
the offspring of a clandestine union between a ksatriya male 
and a sudra female. 

&aikha. According to Manu X. 21 he is the same as avantya. 

Â£ailusa. Vianu Dh, S. 51. 13, Manu IV. 214, Harlta quoted 
by Apararka p. 279 distinguish him from rangavatarl and 
the Brahmapurana ( quoted by Apararka p. 1178 ) defines 
him as one who finds out employment for natas 804 . Apastamba 
9. 32 ( verse ) speaks of him in the same breath with rajaka and

vyadha. Yaj, II. 48 does the same and the Mit. thereon para- 
phrases the word by na^a. 

Saundiha ( wine-seller ). Visnu Dh. S. 51. 15, Manu IV. 
216, Yaj. II. 48, Sankha ( quoted by" Apararka p. 1175 ) and 
Brahmapurana ( quoted by Apararka p. 1177 ) mention him. 

iivapaca or dvapaka. He is one of the antyajas enumerated 
by Veda-Vyasa ( I. 12-13 ). Vide note 173 above. He occurs in 
the gana kulaladi ( Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). According to Baud. Dh. S. 
( I. 9. 12 ), Kaut. ( III. 7 ), he is the offspring of an ugra male 
from a female of the ksatr sub-caste, while according to Manu 
X. 19 he is the offspring of a ksatr male from an ugra female. 
Vaik. ( X. 15 ) and Sutasamhita say that he is the offspring of 
a candala male and a brahmana female, while U6anas ( 11 ) 
holds that he is the offspring of a candala male from a vai6ya 
woman. According to Manu X. 51-56 candalas and 6vapacas 
follow the same avocation and are governed by the same rules 
( vide p. 81 under candala ). Uganas ( 12 ) says that they eat the 
flesh of dogs and that dogs are their wealth, while Vaik. says 
that they wear the same marks that candalas have to wear 
( under the king's order, as Manu says in X. 55 ), that they 
remove the filth of towns etc., stay near cemeteries, have to dis- 
pose of corpses of men that leave no relatives, have to act as 
hangmen for offenders sentenced to death and to take their 
clothes etc., have to take food in broken pots and to eat dogs' 
flesh and to deal in hides and armour ( or in armour made of 
hides ). The Bhagavadglta ( 5. 18 ) puts him on the same level 
with dogs. In the Markandeya-purana (8. 81-83, 86, 96 ) a 
candala is called svapaka ( i. e. no distinction is made between 
the two). In the Jativiveka he is identified with the Mahar and 
with the Mang of the Deccan. 

Satvata. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same as 
karusa above. 

Sudhanvacarya. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same 
as karusa above. 

Suvarva. According to U&anas (vv. 24-25)he is the offspring 
of the legal union with Vedic mantras of a brahmana male and 
a ksatriya female. It appears likely that the text is corrupt 
and we should read savarna for suvarna. He should perform 
rites prescribed by the Atharvaveda, he should by the king's 
order ride a horse, elephant or chariot, may act as the comman- 
der of an army or may practise as a physician.

98 History of Dharma&astra [ Ch. II 

Suvarnakara or Sauvarnika or Hemakara (goldsmith). A 
biranyakara is mentioned in the Vaj. S. XXX. 17 and in Tai. 
Br. III. 4. 14. According to Visnu Dh. S. X. 4 and Narada 
(rnadana 274 ) a goldsmith or a dealer in bronze or a bania was 
to examine the balance in the balance ordeal. Manu IV. 215, 
Yaj. 1. 163, Sankha and Sumantu quoted by Apararka ( pp. 1175, 
1176 ) treat him on a level with karmakara ( blacksmith ) and 
nisada. Manu IX. 292 condemns him as the worst of all 
rogues ( sarvakantakapapistha ). For the view of Vaik. and 
Brhaspati vide under taksan above ( note 189 ). In the Maha- 
bharata it is said that after Parasurama's alleged extermination 
of the ksatriyas, some of them that escaped resorted to the 
castes of ironsmiths and goldsmiths. 201 

Sucaka. According to Usanas ( v. 43 ) he is an anuloma 
born of the marriage of a vaisya male from a sudra female. 

Sucika or saucika or sucl â one who works with a needle, 
a tailor. According to Vaik. ( X. 15 ) and Usanas ( v. 22 ) he is a 
pratiloma, offspring of a vaidehaka from a ksatriya woman 
and engages in the work of sewing with a needle. Saucika, 
according to the lexicon of Amara, is the same as tunnavaya (for 
which see above p. 83 ) and the Brahmapurana quoted by Apar- 
arka ( p. 1178 ) also equates suci with tunnavaya. 

Suta. For vedic references see above p. 43. According to 
Gaut. (IV. 15), Baud. Dh. S. (I. 9. 9 ), Vas. (18. 6), Kaut. (III. 7), 
Manu(X. 11), Narada ( strlpurhea 110), Visnu Dh. S. (16.6), 
Yaj. (I. 93) and Sutasamhita, he is a pratiloma sprung from a 
ksatriya male and a brahmana woman. Kaut. is careful to add 
that the suta who figures in the puranas as the reciter is quite 
different from this. A vartika on Pan. ( VI. 3. 70 ) teaches the 
formation of words like sutaputrl. 206 According to Manu (X.47) and 
Visnu the avocation of sutas is driving a chariot ( i. e, breaking 
and yoking horses). According to Vaik. (X. 13) he makes his liveli- 
hood by reminding the king of his duties and by cooking food 
for him. Usanas (v. 3) also says that his business is to remind (a 
king) of his duties. According to the Karnaparva( 32. 48) sutas

are the attendants of brahmanas andksatriyas and the latter need 
not carry out what the suta says. According to the Vayupurana 
( vol. 1. 1. 33-33 and vol. II. 1. 139 ) the suta was to preserve the 
pedigrees of kings and great men and traditions about learning or 
books, he is not authorised to study the Veda, the middling way 
of maintenance for him is to depend upon kings and to look after 
chariots, elephants and horses ; an inferior way of maintenance 
is the practice of medicine. The Vaik. ( X. 13 ) and the Suta- 
samhita expressly say that the difference between the suta and 
the ratbakara consists in this that the former is the offspring of 
a marriage, while the latter is the offspring of a clandestine 
union of a ksatriya male with a brahmana woman. The 
Sahyadrikhanda (26. 53-54) says that he is inferior to ksatriyas, 
but is entitled to do all the work of a ksatriya and that he also 
performs the work of a charioteer, of taming elephants and 
riding horses. 

Sunika or Saunika (a butcher). According to Usanas (v. 14) 
he is the offspring of an ayogava from a ksatriya woman. 
Harlta ( quoted by Apararka p. 279 ) speaks of him in the same 
breath with rajaka and carmakara. The Brahmapurana ( quoted 
by Apararka p. 1177 ) says that he is ' pasumaraka'. Sumantu 207 
quoted by Par. M. makes his food unfit for brahmanas. He is 
the same as * khatika * according to the Jativiveka. 

Sairindhra. According to Manu X. 32 he is the offspring of a 
dasyu ( as defined in Manu X. 45 ) from an ayogava woman 
and he makes his living by combing the hair ( of men and 
women ), he is not to be treated as a dasa ( i. e. he has not to eat 
ucchista food ), but is to perform menial work ( such as sham- 
pooing the body ) or is to subsist by catching deer etc. The word 
is included in the gana kulaladi ( Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). From the 
Mahabharata we see what duties DraupadI disguised as sair- 
andhrl had to do for the queen of Virata ( Virata-parva 9. 18-19 ), 
viz. combing and arranging the hair, pounding unguents, making 
garlands. Similarly DamayantI became a sairandhrl to the 
mother of the Cedi king ( Vanaparva 65. 68-70), but she 
refused to eat ucchista food, would not wash the feet of any- 
body and would not allow any man to approach her. According 
to Adipurana quoted in Sudrakamalakara he lives by hunting 
deer and guarding royal harems and women after delivery.

Svpaka. According fco Manu (X. 38) he is the offspring of a 
candala male and a pukkasa female, subsists by the profession 
of being hangman to those whom the king condemns to death. 

Saduhanvana. Vide note on 'rathakara* above (p. 45). 
Vide Kamasutra I. 5. 37. 

It will have been noticed that some of the castes mentioned 
in the smrtis such as ambastha, magadha, malla and vaidehaka 
are connected with countries ( Amba, Magadha, Videha etc. ), 
that some others are based upon race such as Abhlra, Kirata and 
Saka. Manu ( X. 43-45 ) and the Mahabharata ( Anusasana- 
parva 33. 21-23 and 35. 17-18 ) were prepared to admit that 
several foreign races like the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Dravi- 
das, Daradas, Sabaras, Kiratas etc were originally ksatriyas, 
but had been reduced to the status of sudras by losing contact 
with brahmanas or by not liking the idea of being subject to the 
brahmanical system. The Visnupurana (IV. 4. 47-48) says the 
same. Numerous names of castes arise from the professions 
they follow, e. g. ayaskara, kumbhakara, carmakara, taksan, 
tailika, nata, rathakara, vena etc. Even in ancient times 
brahmanas followed so many different occupations almost as in 
modern times that the list of brahmanas who cannot be invited 
at sraddhas because they follow occupations other than those 
prescribed for them is rather very formidable ( vide Manu III. 
151 ff. and the remarks on panktipavana later on ). 

It appears that comparatively very early many among the 
brahmanas had given up the occupations peculiar to them and 
were entitled to be called brahmanas simply because of their 
birth. The Mahabhasya 808 of Patanjali quotes a verse 'tapas, 
vedic study, and birth ( from brahmana parents ) â these are the 
causes why a person is called a brahmana ; he who is devoid of 
tapas and vedic study is a brahmana only by birth ( and not a 
real brahmana ) \ Similarly in another place Patanjali quotes 
a verse ' know this to be the auspicious sign of the best of 
brahmanas, viz. whose lore, actions and birth are all three holy' 
( vol. II. p. 220 on Pan. IV. 1. 44 ). Though in the Mahabharata

it is often said that a brahmana is so by birth alone and that he 
deserves respect from all, still we meet several times with 
passages 809 wherein there is a revolt against the caste system 
dependent on birth alone and where it is severely condemned 
and great emphasis is laid on the moral worth of a man. In the 
Vanaparva (181. 42-43) we are told 810 4 Truthfulness, restraint, 
tapas } generosity, non-injury to sentient beings, constant 
adherence to dharma-thesQ always lead men to the fruition ( of 
their goal ) and not caste nor family \ Udyogaparva ( 43. 20 ff. ) 
explains at great length what is meant by self-restraint. In 
the Santiparva 211 (189. 4 and 8) * Truthfulness, generosity, free- 
dom from hatred and wickedness, humility, kindness, and tapas â 
he is known as a brahmana where these are seen. If these signs 
are seen in a sudra and they do not exist in a brahmana, then 
the sudra would not be a sudra and the brahmana would not be 
a brahmana'. In another place we are told 812 * there is no 
difference between the varnas; the whole world is brahma ( the 
creation of Brahma ), since it was created by Brahma in former 
ages and was evolved into varnas by actions ( or. occupations ).' 
Udyogaparva ais ( 43. 49 ) remarks * Do not regard a person as 
brahmana by his talk ; he who does not depart from truth is a 
brahmana* ; Vanaparva ( 216. 14-15 ) 4 that sudra who is always 
struggling for self-restraint, truthfulness and dharma is a 
brahmana in my opinion, for a brahmana is so by his character.' 
Vide Vanaparva ( 313. 108-111 ) and Yaj. I. 200 and Vrddha 
Gautama p. 632. It has been seen above ( p. 6 ) that Gautama 
laid the greatest emphasis on the eight qualities of the soul. But

in spite of those sentiments the caste system dependent on birth 
has continued in all its strength and rigour for ages and writers 
like the Par. M. II. 1, p. 228 are emphatic in saying that between 
jati and character one must look principally to the eminence 
of the caste. 

In certain medieval works called Jativivoka and in other 
works like the Sudra-karnalakara ( first half of 17th century A. 
D, ) several moro castes are mentioned, some of which are set 
out below. 

Aghasika or Andhasika â from a vaidehika male and a sudra 
female; sells cooked food; also called Randhavanu. 

Avartaka â from a bhrjjakantha and a brahmana woman. 

Ahitundika â from a nisada and a vaideha female ; called 
GarudI in Marathi. 

Aurabhra â called Dhangar in Marathi ( tends rams and 
ewes for their wool ), 

Katad kanakaâ from avartaka and a brahmana woman. 

Kuntalaha â the same as napita. 

Kuruvinda â from a kumbbakara and a kukkuta female. 
Same as modern Sail, according to Sudrakamalakara. 

Ghclika from a Vyadha male and garudl female. He is 
called Undiramaru (rat-killer) in the vernacular. 

Durbhara â from an ayogava and a dhigvana woman ; called 
Pohor ( or Dhor ) in modern times. 

Paustika â from a brahmana and a nisada female ; called 
in modern times Kahara or Bhol (palanquin-bearer). 

Plava â from a candala and an andhra woman; called 'hadi' 
in modern times. 

Bandhul aâ -from maitreya and janghika female ; called 
Jharekarl now ( who takes out gold particles from the dust at 
the doors of goldsmiths). 

Bhasmankura â from a Saiva fallen ascetic and a sudra pro- 
stitute ; called Gurava by the Jativiveka. 

Manyu â from a vaisya and a ksatriya female; called 
Tavafta ( thief catcher ). 

Romika â from malla and an avartaka woman ; called 
Lonar in modern times ( manufacturer of salt ). 



Oh. II ] Varna and modern castes 103 

fialakya or Sakalya from a malakara and kayastha woman ; 
called Maniar. 

tiuddha-Marjalta â called Mandali ( who gains livelihood 
by singing and playing on musical instruments ). 

SindolaJca or spandalilm, from a sudra male and a magadha 
female ; called Raiigarl ( dyer ). 

In modern times each of the principal varnas has numerous 
sub-castes, based upon difference of country, occupation, sect and 
other causes. For example, brahmanas are first divided into 
ten classes, five of them being Gaudas 214 and five Dravidas. 
Among the Dravida brahmanas, the Maharastra brahmanas are 
again subsided into numerous sub-castes such as the Cit- 
pavana ( orTlonkanastha ), Karhade, Desastha, Devarukhe etc. 
It is said that in Gujerat there are 84 subcastes of brahmanas, 815 
most of which do not interdine nor intermarry. There is often a 
further distinction among the members of the same subcaste, 
viz. those who follow the priestly occupation and those who do 
not. The spirit of exclusiveness and ideas of superiority that 
arose in vedio times gradually led on to further and further 
divisons and subdivisions of people owing to geographical 
situation and other 81<5 causes. It appears that probably even in 
ancient times the brahmanas of the north looked down upon the 
brahmanas in eastern countries like Magadha. Vide notes 
31-32 above and Fick (pp. 213-214). The Matsyapurana ( 16. 16 ) 
says that brahmanas who dwell in Mleccha countries, in 
Trisahku, Barbara, Odra ( Orissa ), Andhra ( Telingana ), Takka, 
Dravida and Konkana are not to be invited at sraddhas.* 17

Among ksatriyas there are several subdivisions, such as 
those claiming descent from the Sun or the Moon and those that 
call themselves to be Agnikulas ( vide Sherring, vol. I. p. 120 
ff. and Tod's Rajasthan vol. I chapter VII for lists of royal 
tribes ). The Paramaras have 35 branches, Guhilofcs 24 branches. 
Chahmanas 26 branohes, Solankis 16 branches and so on. 

Even among comparatively late works the total number of 
subcastes enumerated does not go beyond even two hundred. 
For example, Wilson in * Indian castes * vol. I pp. 65-70 mentions 
only 134 castes with their Sanskrit and modern Marathi names 
as gathered from the Jativiveka, Madhava-kalpalata, Parasu- 
rama-pratapa and other works. It is only in the census reports 
prepared at great expense by the British Government after 
elaborate efforts and organization that the great complexity of 
the caste system in modern India is laid bare to the eye. But 
this work cannot, by reason of its limited scope, go into these 
varied and complex details of the hundreds of castes that exist 
in the several provinces of India. 



CHAPTER III 

THE DUTIES, DISABILITIES AND PRIVILEGES 

OF THE VARNAS 

The duties and privileges of varum occupy a very- 
prominent place in all works on Dharmasastra. The study ( of 
the Vedas ), offering sacrifices and giving gifts are said to be 
the duties absolutely enjoined on the brahmana, ksatriya and 
vaisya,* 18 while each of these three varnas has certain peculiar 
privileges, which are its principal means of livelihood. Teach- 
ing Vedas, officiating at sacrifices and receiving gifts â these 
are the privileges of brahmanas ; the profession of arms and 
protection of the people are the peculiar privileges of ksatriyas; 
agriculture, rearing cattle, trade and money-lending are the 
peculiar privileges of vaisyas. The first three viz. study, 
sacrifices and liberality are said to be the dharmas of all dvijas 
and the other actions such as teaching the Veda are said to be 
the vrtti or jlviha ( means of livelihood ) of the dvijas. The conse- 
quence of this bifurcation is that if the first three are not 
performed or are neglected, the person concerned was deemed 
to incur siu, while a brahmana is not bound necessarily to earn 
his livelihood by all or any one of the three viz. teaching, 
officiating at a sacrifice or receiving gifts. 219 A few words on 
each of these duties and privileges must be said at this stage. 

Studtj ( of Vedas ). It has been already stated ( p. 38 ) that 
brahmana and learning had become indissolubly connected even 
in early Vedic periods. We see in the Satapatha Br. and in the 
Upanisads that certain kings had attained eminence as 
philosophers or students of brahma-vidya and then even learned 
brahmanas came to them as pupils. For example, Yajnavalkya 
learnt from Janaka ( Sat. Br. XI. 6. 21. 5 ), Balaki Gargya from

Svetaketu Aruneya from Pravahana 280 Jaivali ( Chan. Up. 
V. 3 ), five brahmanas from Asvapati, king of Kekaya ( Chan.

YajfLavalkya as one who had studied the Vedas and Upanisads. 881 
From this it may be inferred that some ksatriyas at least 
spent a good deal of time in the study of religious and 
philosophical doctrines. The conclusion 822 that is sometimes

222. Vide Deussen's ' Das System dea VedSnta ', 1883, (pp. 18-19 ) 
( the real cherisher of those thoughts was originally the caste of the 
ksatriyas, rather than tire caste of the priests. Over and over again we 
come across the situation that the brShmana asks the ksatriya f or infor- 
mation ' and Deussen refers only to six passages ( f Br. Up. II. 1, VI. 2, 
Ch. Up. V. 3 and V. 11 and Kausltaki Up. I. 1 and IV. 1 V Vide also 
'Philosophy of the Upanishads ' (translated by Geden, 1905, pp. 17-19). 
In the first place these are too few passages out of tho vast Upani^ad 
literature to found the sweeping generalisation in which the German 
savant indulges. In tho second place in Br. Up. II. 1 and Kausltaki 
Up. IV. there is no statement that brahmavidyS was known only to 
ksatriyas; on tho contrary Aj5taÂ£atru expresses surprise that a 
brShmana should approach a ksatriya for the expounding of brahma- 
vidyS and says that this is opposed to tho natural (or usual) order of 
affairs. This shows that AjStas'atru was an exception and that brahmanas 
usually taught brahmavidyS. In Kausltaki I. 1. and Ch. Up. 
V. 11 all that is narrated is that Gautama Svetaketu learnt from 
Citra Gargyayaui and oertain drotriyas like Aupamanyava learnt Vaid- 
vSnaravidya from Asvapati Kaikeya. But nothing is said here about 
brahma vidya being first known to ksatriyas only. In Br. Up. VI. 2 and 
Ch. Up. V. 11 it is no doubt stated that * this Vidya ' was not known to 
any brahmana till then ; but 'this vidya' does not mean tho whole of the 
philosophy of brahma, but only that particular doctxine which bears tho 
name of pancagnividyS. This vidya no doubt propounds the doctrine 
of transmigration in a figurative and somewhat picturesque way. But 
that doctrino is elsewhere elaborated by brahmanas like YSjnavalkya to 
the brahmanas in king Janaka's court and to Janaka himself ( vide Br. 
Up. III. 2. 13 and IV. 4. 3-4). Nor can it be said that the doctrine of 
transmigration was not at all known before the UpaniÂ§ads. The same 
views are eohoed by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in * Verhand-lungen des VII

drawn by certain writers that ksatriyas or kings were the 
pioneers in brahmavidya cannot be accepted as correct. The 
germs of the philosophy of the Upanisads are seen in the later 
hymns of the Rgveda, in the Atharvaveda and in some of the 
Brahmana treatises. The Upanisads are full of brahmanas who 
independently propounded various aspects of brahma-vidya and 
there is no reason to suppose that the few ksatriyas referred to as 
masters of the vidya were the only persons who first attained to 
that position. There are hardly any ancient passages to show 
that vaisyas devoted any portion of their time to veda study. 
The Kathaka-Samhita 283 (IX. 16) indicates that all varnas 
studied the Veda since it speaks of a person not a brahmana, 
having studied ( Vedic ) lores and yet not shining (by his 
learning ). 

As to brahmanas the matter stands thus. The Nirukta 
( II. 4 ) contains four 224 verses ( which are called Vidyasukta ), 
the first of which says that vidya came to the brahmana and 
requested him to guard her as his treasure. The Mahabhasya 225 
of Patanjali quotes as an agama ( Vedic passage ) the words ' a 
brahmana should study and understand without any motive ( of 
profit ) dharma, the Veda with its sir subsidiary lores ( viz. 
phonetics etc. ) \ Manu IV. 147 says * a brahmana should 
always and assiduously study the Veda alone; that (Veda 
study) is his highest dharma; everything else is inferior 
dharma \ Yaj. ( 1. 198 ) observes * the Creator created brahmanas 
for the preservation of the vedas, for the satisfaction of the

themselves in active speculation on religious matters about the time of 
the Upanisads and are mentioned as the original possessors of the new 
knowledge,' and the learned Doctor refers only to Ch. Up. V. 3 and V. 11. 
It may be stated that Hopkins ( in ' Ethics of India ' 1924 p. 63 ), Barth 
(Religions of India p. 65 ) and Vedic Index ( vol. II p. 206 ) do not 
subscribe to these views of Deussen and Bhandarkar.

except ' adbyapita ye ' in Visnu Dh. S. 29. 9-10 and 30. 47 ; Manu II.

gods and pitrs, for the safeguarding of dharma.' Atri ( 25 ) con- 
tains the same idea. Other 886 sages say that ho in whose family 
Veda ( Vedio study ) and vedl ( consecration of fires for 6rauta 
rites ) are given up for three generations becomes a durbrahmana 
( an unworthy or bad brahmana ). The Tai. S. ( II. 1. 10. i ) 
prescribes a rite for a durbrahmana in whose family cessation 
of drinking soma occurred for generations and who himself 
desired to drink soma. 

Teaching the Veda â It is probable that in very remote times 
the son was taught the Veda by his father. The story of Svetaketu 
Aruneya ( Chandogya V. 3. 1. and VI. 1. 1-2 and Br. Up. VI. 2. 
1 ) shows that he learnt all the Vedas from his father and the 
legend in the Br. Up. ( V. 2. 1 ) that the gods, men and asuras 
learnt from their father Prajapati points in the same direction. 827 
Rg. VII. 103. 5 shows that instruction was oral and consisted 
in the pupil repeating the words uttered by the teacher. 888 
Whatever may have been the case in very remote times, from 
the times of the Brahmana literature and in the times of the 
dharmasastras teaching Vedic literature was almost universally 
in the hands of brahmanas. Some ksatriya teachers or philoso- 
phers are referred to in the Satapatha ( VIII. 1. 4. 10 and XT. 6. 2 ) 
and elsewhere, but they are generally held in low esteem. The 
Ap. Dh.S. 229 (II. 2. 4. 25-28) lays down that the brahmana 
alone can be the teacher ( of a brahmana ), but in distress ( i. e. 
in the absence of a brahmana teacher ), a brahmana may learn 
from a ksatriya or vaisya, but the only service ( which as a 
pupil ) he should render to a ksatriya or vaisya teacher is to 
go after him ( and not shampooing his feet etc. ) and after the 
brahmana finishes his study, the brahmana may go in front

( ofjhis ksatriya teacher ). Gaut. ( VII. 1-3 ) and Manu ( X 1, 
II. 241 ) lay down the same rules. Manu ( II. 242 ) adds that a 
perpetual student ( naisthika brahmacarl ) should not stay as a 
pupil with a teacher who is not a brahmana and that a brah- 
mana may learn even from a sudra a useful or efficacious 
craft ( II. 238 ). The profession of teaching the Veda could not 
have brought much money or wealth to brahmanas, since very 
great emphasis was laid, as we shall see later, on teaching 
without any prior agreement about payment. It was the 
privilege of a brahmana alone to officiate as a priest. Jaimini 820 
says that, as the ksatriya and vaisya cannot be priests (rtviks ), 
the satfcra ( a sacrifice extending over many days or years ) 
could be performed only by brahmanas. The Katyayana Srauta- 
sutra uses a similar argument. When Visvarnitra agreed to 
perform a sacrifice for Trisanku who had been cursed to be a 
candala, the Ramayana 831 says that the gods and sages would 
not accept the oblations. It is doubtful whether the same rigid 
rule prevailed in ancient Vedio days. In Rg, X 98. 7 it is 
said that Devapi was the purohita of Santanu and the Nirukta 
( II. 10 ) adds that Devapi and Santanu were brothers and des- 
cendants of Kuru. So, according to the Nirukta at least, a 
ksatriya could be a purohita in Vedio times. It may be admit- 
ted that the Rg. itself does not expressly say that they were 
brothers. In modern times many writers often speak of brah- 
manas as the priestly caste or as priests. But this is not a 
very accurate statement. All brahmanas never were nor are 
priests; besides even in modern times when caste is so rigid 
all priests in all temples and shrines are not brahmanas. 
Some brahmanas became the family priests (purohitas) of kings, 
many engaged as rtviks at solemn srauta sacrifices or at domes- 
tic rites and ceremonies. Temple priests are comparatively a 
later institution and they were generally looked down upon in 
olden times and are regarded as inferior even in modern times. 828 
Manu ( III. 152 ) says that a devalaka i. e. a brahmana who took

remuneration to perform service before the image in a temple 
for three years continuously was unfit to be invited at a Sraddha 
or to officiate in a sacrifice for gods. 

The third means of livelihood permitted to brahmanas was 
receiving gifts from a worthy or unblemished person. Accord- 
ing to Yama m quoted in the Sm. C. ( I. p. 179 ) pratigraha ( recei- 
ving gifts ) from a worthy person of the three higher varnas is 
superior to the acquisition of wealth by officiating as a priest 
or by teaching. But Manu (X. 109-11) says that pratigraha 
from an unworthy person ( or a sudra ) is worse than the act of 
teaching him or officiating as a priest for him. Very elaborate 
rules were laid down about gifts i. e. who should receive gifts, 
from whom gifts may be received and on what occasions and 
what things were proper subjects of gift. The latter two matters 
will be discussed in detail later on. Here the rules about the per- 
sons to whom gifts should be made and from whom they were to 
be accepted will be set out. It appears from the Br. Up. (IV. 1.3) 
that even in those ancient times there were prohibitions against 
receiving gifts from unworthy persons and officiating as priests 
for the unworthy. And the Br. Up. ( V. 14. 5-6 ) suggests that 
it is only the learned who could properly accept large gifts. 

In the first place, the ideal set before brahmanas was one 
of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of forsaking the 
active pursuit of riches and cherishing cultural preservation 
and advancement. Manu lays down the general rule that 
when not in distress a brahmana should acquire wealth only 
just sufficient to maintain himself and his family, and to 
enable him to perform his religious duties without causing any 
harm to others or by as little harm to others as possible and 
without unduly worrying his own body ( IV. 2-3 ) and then 
Manu ( IV. 7-8 ) says 234 that a brahmana householder may

ing to Kulluka one wbo bas corn sufficient for tbreo years is called 
' kusuladhanya ' as suggested by Manu X. 7; while *kumbhidha"nya ' 
is one who has a store of corn for one year. MedhStithi says that 
there is no restriction to corn only ; one who has wealth either in corn 
or money to satisfy his needs for three years is * kusHladhSnya ' ; 
according to GovindaiSja, 4 kusuladha"nya ' and ' kurnbhidhanya > are 
respectively those who have com for 12 and 6 days. The Mit. 
on Y5j. I. 128 accepts GovindarUja's explanation.

either accumulate so rauoh grain ( but not more ) as would fill a 
kusula ( a granary ), or a kumbhfi 25 or he may have as much 
corn as would satisfy all his needs for three days or as much 
as will suffice for the day that is on and that out of these four 
each succeeding one was superior to each preceding one i. e. one 
who had no more accumulation of material goods than for the 
day itself ( and who did not care for the morrow ) was the best 
brahmana. Yaj. I, 128 speaks of a fifth grade viz. a brahmana 
should subsist by collecting the ears of corn that are left in 
the field after the crops are gathered or the single grains of 
corn so left and Manu (X. 112) says that if a brahmana 
cannot maintain himself he may prefer to live on the collection 
of fallen ears of corn or grains rather than receive gifts. This 
last mode is designated rfca by Manu ( IV. 5 ). Manu ( IV. 12, 
15, 17 ) lays down that a brahmana should cultivate supreme 
contentment and though desirous of happiness should restrain 
himself ( in the pursuit of wealth ), he should not, even when 
in distress, hanker after the acquisition of wealth by excessive 
attachment or by doing what is forbidden or by accepting gifts 
from any person whatever ( of blemished character etc. ) and he 
should give up pursuits that are opposed to ( cause obstacles in ) 
his devotion to Vedio study. Yaj. ( I. 129 ) says the same thing 
in more concise language. Vyasa prescribes that a brahmana 
should seek to narrow down his means of livelihood and should 
not hanker after excess of wealth ; if he sets about accumulation 
of wealth he loses the ( glorious ) status of brahmanya. 828 The 
Mahabharata says that when a brahmana has more corn than 
he would require to satisfy his needs for three years, then he 
should offer a sacrifice with that wealth and he should not go 
on accumulating wealth in vain and that accumulation of vast 
wealth is a calamity for a brahmana. 837 

Gautama ( IX, 63 ), Yaj. ( I. 100 ), Visnu Dh. S. ( 63. 1 ), and 
Laghu-Vyasa (II. 8 ) say that a brahmana snould approach a 

235. That this ideal of 'kumbhldhanya' is very ancient is shown by 
the use of tho word kumbhidhSnya in the Maha"bha*Â§ya where 
it is explained as follows ( on Pan. I. 3. 7, vol. I. p. 264 )

king ( or a rich man ) for his yogaksema ( i. e. for his livelihood 
and support ). Manu ( IV. 33 ), Yaj. ( I. 130 ), and Vas. Dh. S. 
( XII. 2 ) declare that a brahmana when oppressed by hunger 
should seek for help ( or money ) from a king, from his pupil or 
from one who is able and willing to offer a sacrifice. But a 
brahmana should not receive a gift from an irreligious king or 
other irreligious donor. This implies that if the brahmana is not 
hungry and has sufficient wealth either obtained by inheritance 
or partition or in any other way he should not go about seeking 
for wealth and should not receive gifts ( Manu IV. 34 ). If a 
brahmana cannot secure gifts from the above three, then he may 
do so from any other worthy dvijalL m When even that is not 
possible and the brahmana is in difficulties he was allowed to 
take a gift from anybody including a sudra ( Manu X. 102-103, 
Yaj. Ill, 41); but a brahmana should not seek gifts from a 
sudra for the performance of a sacrifice or for agnihotra, as 
thereby he becomes a candala in another birth ( Manu XI. 24 
and 42, Yaj. 1. 127). A brahmana trying to support his hungry 
elders ( parents etc. ), his dependants ( wife, servants etc. ), and 
about to worship gods and honour guests may accept a gift 
from anybody ( except a patita ), but should not satisfy his own 
hunger with that wealth (Manu IV. 251, Vas. 14. 13, Visnu Dh. 
S. 57. 13, Yaj. I. 216 ). Yaj., however, allowed this even for 
one's own livelihood. Gaut. 239 ( 18. 24-25 ) allows a brahmana 
to receive even from a sudra as much as would enable him to 
finish marriage ceremonies on which he has embarked or to get 
materials for a sacrifice when he has begun it. One may take 
gifts from a sudra or ugra for paying a fee to one's guru at the 
end of the period of brahmacarya ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 20-21 ). 
A brahmana was not to seek gifts from a king who was not of 
ksatriya lineage nor from butchers, oilmen, keepers of liquor- 
shops and of brothels nor from courtesans ( Manu IV. 84 ), nor 
from a king who is avaricious and transgresses the rules of the 
iastras uo ( Yaj. I. 140, Manu IV. 87 ). The Smrtis lay down

that it is the duty of the king to support &rotriyas ( br&bmanas 
learned in the Veda ) and brahraanas who are incapable of 
struggling for their maintenance (Gaut. X. 9-10, Yaj. III. 
44, Atri 24 ) and that if a srotriya perishes through hunger in 
the domains of a king, that country would suffer from famine 
and disease ( Manu VII. 134 ). Yaj. III. 44 lays down that it is 
the duty of a king to assign a proper means of livelihood to a 
brahmana in distress, having regard to the brahmana's conduct, 
descent, learning, Vedic study, tapas, the members in his 
family. 841 The ideal set before brahmanas in the matter of 
pratigraha ( receiving gifts ) was that he, who though entitled 
to accept a gift ( on account of his Vedic learning and tapas ) 
does not take it, attains to the highest worlds ( Yaj. I. 213 ); and 
Manu ( IV. 186 ) says that though entitled to accept gifts a 
brahmana should not again and again resort to that method, 
since the spiritual power ( due to Vedic study ) that he acquires 
is lost by accepting gifts. Another rule about gifts is laid 
down in many works as follows. When a donor himself goes 
to the place of a worthy donee and makes a gift that is the best 
gift, when a donor calls a donee to his place and makes a gift 
it is middling and when a donor gives if begged by a donee it 
is inferior. 848 Manu ( IV. 188-191 ) prescribes that a man, who 
is not learned, is reduced to ashes like fuel if he accepts a 
gift of gold, land, horses, cows, food, clothes, sesame and ghee, 
that a brahmana who, being devoid of learning and tapas 
( Tegulated life ), desires to accept gifts sinks ( into Hell ) as 
one who sits in a stone boat sinks in water ; and that therefore a 
brahmana who is not learned should be afraid of receiving gifts. 



241. We find that kings followed these directions from very 
ancient times. In Karle Inscription No. 13 (E. I. vol. VII. p. 57) and 
Nasik cave Inscription No. 12 ( E. I. Vol. VIII p. 78) king UsavadSta 
( lisabhadatta )> proclaims that he gave one lakh of cows and 16 villages 
to brShmanas at PrabhRsa and got some of them married at his expense 
and that he also fed every year a lakh of brffhmanas. In numerous 
grants of lands and villages the purpose of the grants is said to be to 
enable the donees to perform the five Mahayajhas, Agnihotra, Vaidvadeva, 
the offering of bali and caru ( \ide Sarsavni plate of BuddharSja in B. I.

To the same effect are Yaj. ( I. 200-202 ), Vas. Dh. S. ( VI 32 ), 
AuSanasa ( Jiv. I. p. 521 which is almost the same as Maim 
IV. 188). Just as a brahmana who was not learned was 
enjoined not to accept a gift, so conversely people were asked to 
make gifts only to learned and worthy men. Even so early 
as the Sat. Br. this is emphasized as in IV. 3. 4. 15 ( S. B. E. 
vol. 26 p. 344 ) " thus those cows of his are given to him who 
is fit to receive a daksina and not to him who is unfit'. Vide 
IIL 5. 1. 19 (S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 114) also. The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 15. 
9-10 ) prescribes * one should invite for dinner in all religious 
acts brahmanas who are pure and who have studied the Veda 
and one should distribute gifts at a proper time and place and 
on occasions of purificatory rites and when there is a worthy 
acceptor/ E * 3 To the same effect are Vas. Dh. S. Ill, 8 and VI. 
30, Manu ( III. 128, 132 and IV. 31 ), Yaj. ( 1. 201 ), Daksa III. 26 
and 31. 844 The smrtis say that gifts given to a brahmana who 
has not studied the Veda or who is avaricious and deceitful are 
fruitless and lead the donor to hell ( Manu IV. 192-194, Atri 
152, Daksa III. 29 ). Manu ( XI. 1-3 ) says that nine kinds of 
sriataka brahmanas who are poor are the primary objects of the 
gift of food and fees inside the sacrificial altar ; while to others 
food and wealth may be given outside the altar ( bahirvedi ). 

An exception was made in the case of gifts made without 
request from the donee. What has been offered unasked may be 
accepted even from one who is guilty of bad actions, except from 
unchaste women, impotent persons and patita ( outcastes or 
persons guilty of mahapatakas ) â Yaj. I. 215, Manu IV. 248-49, 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 11-14 ( where two verses are quoted from a 
Purana which are almost the same as Manu IV. 248-249 ), 
Visnu Dh. S. 57. 11. Many persons are mentioned in the smrtis 
from whom gifts ( particularly of food ) were not to be accepted 
( vide Manu IV. 205-224, Vas. Dh. S. XIV. 2-11 ). 

Another rule about gifts was that a person should prefer a 
learned brahmana who is his neighbour for making a gift to 
one who is not near; if he did not do so, he incurred sin; but 
there was no blame in passing over an ignorant or foolish

br&hmana who stays near in favour of a worthy but distant 
brahmana. 245 Vide Vas. Dh. S. III. 9-10, Manu VIII. 392 
( which prescribes a fine of one masa for this ), Veda-Vyasa- 
smrfci IV. 35-38, Brhaspati-amrti 60 and Laghu-Satatapa 76-79, 
Gobhila-smrti II. 66-69. Devala quoted by Apararka p. 288 and 
Par. M. I. part 1 p. 181 say that that brahmana is a pStra 
( worthy to receive a gift) who is pure in three respects (viz. 
as to his parents and his guru ), whose means of livelihood are 
slender, who is tender-hearted and of restrained senses. Vas. 
Dh. S. VI. 26 and Yaj. I. 200 also define patra similarly. 

It is not to be supposed that the ideal of poverty and non- 
aooeptance of gifts except under compelling circumstances was 
only an ideal hardly ever acted upon at any time or in any 
part of -the country. Even in the 20th century rural India has 
villages with a considerable population of brahmanas where 
many srotriyas ( learned in the Veda ) and pandits ( those who 
study sastras like grammar, logic, mlmansa ) are still found 
who are content with what little patrimony they have got, who 
engage in the profession of teaching the Veda and sastras in 
accordance with ancient rules and who do not go about seeking 
gifts nor accept invitations for dinner at sraddhas. In the 
S&ntiparva 199 brahmanas are divided into two sorts, viz. those 
who are pravrtta ( i. e. engage in all sorts of activities for 
acquiring wealth) and those who are nivrtta and verse 40 defines 
these latter as those who do not resort to pratigraha ( acceptance 
of gifts ). 

Though pratigraha was a special privilege of brahmanas, 
gifts could be made by anybody to anybody. Yaj. I. 6 
says that giving to a worthy person at a proper time is 
the complete definition of dharma and Visvarupa adds that 
gifts could be made by anybody ; but the merit secured by 
making a gift depended upon the worth and caste of the donee.

28 say that a gift given to a brahmana ( who is only so by 
caste, but is not learned ), to a drotriya ( or Scarya ) and to one 
who has completely mastered all the Vedas ( with their subsi- 
diary lores ) respectively confers merit which is twice, a hun- 
dred thousand times or an infinite number of times more than 
the merit conferred by a gift to a non-brahmana. Gautama* 4 * 
( V. 19-20 ) and Baudhayana II. 3. 24 further make it obligatory 
to give outside the sacrificial altar according to one's ability a 
portion of one's wealth to a brahmana, irotriya and veda-paraga 
when they seek help for giving a daksina to their teacher ( at 
the end of the period of studenthood ), for their own marriage, 
for medicine, for their own maintenance ( that day ), for a 
sacrifice, for their own study or journey, and when everything 
has been given in a Visvajit sacrifice and that one must give 
oooked food to all others who beg for it ( except brahmana, iro- 
triya and vedaparaga ). Manu ( XL 1-3 ) gives practically the 
same rule. In the Vaisvadeva the householder was enjoined to 
give food to every one including even dogs and candalas, as we 
shall see later on ( under 848 Vaisvadeva ). Medhatithi on Manu 
IV. 5 says that when a person makes a gift through compassion 
it is not the dana and pratigraha spoken of by the 6astra ; just as 
when a man gives instruction as to what is beneficial he does 
not care to see what the caste of the person to be benefitted by the 
advice is, so a gift made through compassion is made irrespec- 
tive of caste ; and that when non-brahmanas reduced to a help- 
less condition take what is given by others, it cannot be said 
that they are assuming to themselves the livelihood by prati- 
graha which is a peculiar means of livelihood for brahmanas. Â£4a

Oh. Ill ] Proper donees 117 

In spite of the noble ideal set before brahmanas it appears 
that, owing to the growth of the Brahmana population and the 
paucity of gifts and invitations to officiate as priests, the striot 
rules about dana and pratigraha had to be relaxed and in course 
of time it came to be said that a brahmana, whether learned or 
ignorant, was to be a donee and may accept gifts without any 
scruples. The first inroad 850 was made by the rule that in rites 
meant for gods the character and learning of brahmanas need 
not be deeply inquired into, but that such enquiry was proper 
only when they were to be invited for 6raddha ancl other rites 
for the dead, the only exceptions being that a brahmana, who is 
a thief or is guilty of a mahapataka, or is impotent or an atheist 
was not to be invited even in rites for the gods ( vide Manu III. 
149-150). Gradually such views as the following came to be 
recommended. The Skandapurana* 51 as quoted by AparSrka 
( p. 455 ) makes Siva say to ParvatI ' the Vedic revelation is 
that siraddha ( food ) should be given (to a brahmana) after 
inquiry ( into his learning and character ), but straightforward 
aotion is better than scrutiny. When one offers 6raddha 
straightforwardly without scrutiny, his pitrs are satisfied and 
also gods/ The Vrddha-Gautama smrti (chap. Ill pp. 512-513 
and 518, Jiv. ) says ' Brahmanas, whether well conducted or 
of bad conduct, whether vulgar or of polished intellect, should 
not be disrespected like fires covered with ashes. Just as 
fire in whatever condition it may be, is a great deity, so a 
br&hmana is a great deity in whatever condition he may be.' WB 
'The wise should not despise brahmanas, whether they be squint- 
eyed, humpbacked, dwarfs, indigent or diseased, since they are

my forms (i. e. of Krsna)\ The Anutesanaparva ( 152. 19 ) M 
says 'a brahraana who is not learned is a god and he is a worthy 
object for gifts and is a great purifier; a learned brfihmana is a 
greater god ( than an unlearned one ).* 

As already said above teaching could have brought very 
little wealth. There was no state educational system as in 
modern times with stability of tenure and graded rates of 
salary. Nor was there any Copyright Act under which a learned 
man could make money by writing books for students and the 
general public. The brahmanas had no organised corporate 
body like the Anglican Church wifch its hierarchy of Archbi- 
shops, Bishops and other divines, nor was there in anoient India 
any practice of making wills whereby large estates came to the 
Church as in England ( where statutes of Mortmain had to be 
passed to prevent enormous estates from going to the Church). 25 * 
The emoluments of officiating priests and gifts given by 
charitably disposed persons must have been fitful and offered 
only a precarious means of livelihood, as they depended upon 
the volition of others and as the smrtis recommended that even 
in sraddha too many brahmanas should not be invited.* 55 
Besides all brahmanas could not have possessed the memory, 
intelligence and patience required to master the Vedic Literature 
after intensive study for decades of years. Therefore, there is no 
wonder that many brahmanas were compelled by the force of 
circumstances to pursue for their livelihood avocations other 
than the three prescribed ones. From ancient times this was 
recognised by the dharmasastra works. Gaut. ( VII. 6 and 7 ) 
says that if a brahmana cannot maintain himself by means of 
the three peculiar modes of livelihood viz. teaching or officiating 
as a priest for even an unworthy person or by receiving gifts, 
then he should maintain himself by doing the work peculiar to 
a ksatriya ( i. e. by fighting and protecting people ) and if even 
that is not possible then by following the avocations of a vai6ya 
and Gaut. VII. 26 ordains that a ksatriya may resort to the 
profession of the vaisya in similar circumstances. Baudhayana

Ch. Ill ] Other means of maintenance 119 

Dh. S. ( II. 2. 77 ) says the same and then it adds ( II. 2. 78 and 
80) that Gautama says that it should not be so as the duties of a 
ksatriya would be too terrific for a brahmana and that he 
should pursue the avocation of a vaisya. Baudh&yana 
( 1. 1. 20 ) notes that the profession of arms was practised by the 
brahmanas of the north. Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 22 ) lays down that 
persons (of the three higher varnas) should, if they cannot 
maintain themselves by the peculiar avocations of their varna, 
resort to the means of livelihood prescribed for the varna which 
is immediately below their own. Manu X. 81-82, Yaj. III. 35, 
Narada ( rnadana 56 ), Visnu Dh. S. 54. 28, Sankha-Likhita say 
the same f86 thing. It is further laid down by the same works 
that a person belonging to a lower varna should not resort to the 
modes of livelihood peculiar to a higher varna ( vide Vas. Dh. S. 
II. 23, Manu X 95 ). The smrtis further ordain that when the 
calamity or distress ceases, the person who has taken to the 
avocations of another varna should perform prayascitfca, should 
resume his proper avocations and abandon the wealth acquired 
by him by resorting to improper avocations ; vide Manu XI. 
192-193 ; Visnu Dh. S. (54. 27-28), Yaj. III. 35, Narada ( rnadana 
59-60). Manu (X. 96 ) prescribes that, if a person of a lower 
varna maintains himself through greed by the avocation 857 
peculiar to a higher varna, the king should confiscate the 
wealth and should at once banish him from the country. A 
classical example of the keenness with which good kings 
were expected to prevent persons of lower varnas doing the 
actions allowed only to higher varnas is furnished by the 
story of Sambuka narrated in the Ramayana ( VII. 73-76. ) The 
Uttararamacarita of Bhavabhiiti echoes the same sentiments, A 
6udra 858 who engaged in japa, homa, tapas or became an 
ascetic or repeated ( Vedic ) mantras was to be punished ( or 
killed) by the king and was also guilty of mortal sin. 
Manu ( X. 98 ) allows a vai&ya, if unable to maintain himself 
by the pursuits peculiar to his varna, to live by means of the

actions proper for a 6udra viz. serving members of the twioe- 
born classes. It is also said by Gaut. ( VIL 22-24 ) that a 
brShmana may maintain himself in any way if unable to 
maintain himself ( by the three means specially prescribed for 
him ), but he should not resort to the actions peculiar to a 6udra, 
that according to some acaryas he may do even those actions 
when life itself is in danger, but that when he stoops to the 
actions peculiar to sudras for maintenance he should not mix 
himself up with members of that varna (by sitting on the 
same seat with them etc) or eat articles forbidden to br&hmanas 
( such as leek and garlio ) and should not be a mere menial 
servant. Vide Manu ( IV. 4 and 6) and Narada ( rnSdana 57 ). 

According 859 to all ancient authorities the special duty of 
the fcudra was to render service to the t wioe-bom classes, to obtain 
his livelihood from them and serving a brahmana conferred grea- 
ter happiness or benefit on the 6udra than serving a ksatriya 
and serving a ksatriya conferred greater good than serving a 
vateya. According to Gaut. ( X. 60-61 ), Manu ( X. 124-125 ) 
and others, the sudra was to wear the old or casfc-off clothes, 
umbrellas, sandals, mattress etc. of his patron and the leavings 
of food { ucchista ) were to be given to him. If he became old 
and unable to do work while serving anyone of the higher 
varnas he was to be fed by him whom he had formerly served 
(Gaut. X. 63). In course of time the position of the 6udra 
improved. If a 6udra M0 was unable to maintain hi. aself and 
his family by serving dvijas, he was allowed tu maintain 
himself by having recourse to crafts like carpentry or drawing 
or painting pictures etc. Narada ( rnadana 58 ) allowed him 
to perform the work of ksatriyas and vai^yas in times of 
distress. Yaj. (I. 120) also says that, if unable to maintain 
himself by the service of dvijas, the sudra may carry on the 
profession of a vai&ya or may take to the various crafts.

himself by the service of higher varnas to resort to the 
avocations of a vaifcya, to rearing cattle and to crafts. 
Others like Laghu~A6valayana (22.5), Vrddha-Harlta ( VII. 
189, 192 ) allowed agriculture to the sudra. The Kalikapurana 
quoted in the Gr. R. ( p. 479 ) allowed the sudra to sell all 
commodities except honey, skins, laksa ( lac ), wines and flesh, 
while Brhat-Parasara (p. 101 ) prohibited the sudra from selling 
wine and flesh. Devala quoted in the Mit. ( on Yaj. I. 120 ) 
prescribes that the sudra should serve the twice-born and may 
engage in agriculture, rearing cattle, carrying loads, sale of 
commodities, drawing and painting, dancing, singing and 
playing on musical instruments like the flute, lute, drums and 
tabors. 86B The foregoing will show that the sudra gradually 
rose in social status so far as occupation was concerned and 
could follow all occupations except those specially reserved for 
the brahmana, so much so thab sudras became even kings and 
Manu ( IV. 61 ) had expressly to enjoin upon brahmanas not to 
dwell in the kingdom of a sudra. Â£6S The smrtis however did 
not like that wealth should be accumulated in the hands of the 
sudra (though they were quite willing that ksatriyas and vaisyas 
should command all wealth ). Gaut. ( X. 64-65 ) says that the 
sudra's accumulation of wealth should be for the support and 
benefit of the other varnas. Manu (X. 129) says that a sudra, even 
though able to accumulate wealth, should not do so, as ( on 
account of his pride of wealth and his ignorance ) he may cause 
obstructions and trouble to brahmanas. Sudras were divided 
into numerous subcastes. But there were two main divisions. 
One was aniravasita iudras (such as carpenters and blacksmiths) 
and the other niravasita sudras ( like candalas ) ; vide note 200 
above. Another division of sudras was into those who were 
bhojyanna ( i. e. food prepared by whom could be partaken by 
brahmanas ) and abhojyanm. In the first were included one's

with *rg IV. 61. This dictum of Manu must have been pronounced at 
a time when sGdra kings were rare ; otherwise it would have no 
meaning and brahmanas would have been compelled to leave India. So 
it follows that Manu did not hold the view propounded in certain Pur5- 
nas that after the Nandaa there would be no ksatriya kings and only 
fjfldras will be kings.

slave, one's cowherd, barber, family friend and one who 
shared with one the crop reared on one's land (vide Yaj. 1. 166). 
It; is worthy of note that even the Mit. adds the potter to the 
above list. All the other sudras were such that a brahmana 
could not take his food. A third and well-known division was 
into sacchudra ( well-conducted ) and asac-chudra. The former 
class included those sudras who followed good occupations or 
trade, served dvijas and had given up meat and drinking or 
selling liquor. BW The Sudrakamalakara (p. 60 ) says that 
asat-sudras do not incur sin even if they partake of meat and 
liquor, provided they do not eat forbidden meat and that 
there is no lapse if one comes in contact with a sudra that 
drinks liquor. 

A few words may now be said about brahmanas being 
allowed to follow the occupations of ksatriyas and vaisyas. 
From very ancient times brahmanas appear to have followed 
the profession of arms. Pan. ( V. 2. 71 ) teaches 265 the formation 
of the word 'brahmanaka' as applied to a country, which means 
*in which Brahmanas follow the profession of arms.' Kau^. 866 
(IX. 2) quotes the view of the acaryas that when there are armies 
composed of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras each 
preceding one is better for enlistment than each subsequent, 
but Kaut. himself is against this and adds that the enemy may 
win over the army of brahmanas by prostration before them. 
Apastamba was against the idea of brahmanas following the 
profession of arms. He says ( I. 10. 29. 7 ) 267 c a brahmana 
should not catch hold of a weapon even for examining it ( much

less for attacking others with it ) \ Gaut. ( VII. 6 ) allowed a 
brahmana to follow ksatriya's profession in case of distress 
( apad ) and adds ( in VII. 25 ) that even a brahmana while still 
following the peculiar avocation of a brahmana may wield 
weapons when his life is in danger. The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 80) 
quotes a verse * for saving cows and brahmanas, for preventing 
the mixture of varnas, the brahmana and vaisya may take to arms 
from their concern for dharma.' The Vas. Dh. S. (III. 24) allows a 
brahmana to wield a weapon for protecting himself and for pre- 
venting confusion or mingling of varnas. Manu (VIII. 3 48-349) 
allows all dvijatis to resort to weapons where the observance of 
dharma ( or of the duties of varnas and asramas ) is obstructed 
( by violent men ), when there is a disturbance ( due to invasion 
etc. ) involving the twice-born classes, in evil times for protect- 
ing one's self, when there is an attack for carrying away cows 
or other wealth ( given as fees ) and in order to protect women 
and brahmanas and he incurs no sin if he kills ( for these pur- 
poses ). Among the heroes of the Mahabharata there are great 
warriors and commanders like Drona, his son Asvatthaman, 
Krpa (the maternal uncle of Asvatthaman) who were brahmanas. 
The Mahabharata says that a brahmana should fight at the order 
of the king. 268 The Santiparva ( 78. 18 ) calls upon persons of 
all varnas to wield arms when the rules for holding society to- 
gether are broken and when dasyus ( robbers or U)w persons ) 
cause confusion. From ancient; times we find brahmanas as 
commanders and founders of royal dynasties. The famous 
Senapati Pusyamitra belonged to the Sunga gotra and wrested 
an empire from the last of the Mauryas about 184 B. 0. His 
line was followed by the Kanvayanas, the founder being 
minister Vasudeva, a brahmana, who killed the last Sunga about 
72 B. 0. We learn from the Talagunda pillar inscription of 
Kakusthavarman ( E. I. Vol. VIII. p! 24 ) that the founder of 
the Kadambas, Mayurasarman, was a brahmana. In Maratha 
history there were the Peshwas and other brahmana warriors 
and commanders. 

Though it is said that a brahmana in distress may follow 
the occupation of a vaisya, there were several restrictions 
imposed upon brahmanas following the occupations of money* 
lending, agriculture, trade, and the rearing of cattle, which were 
prescribed as the privileged occupations of vaisyas.

124 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. Ill 

As to money-lending, Gaut. 269 ( X. 5-6 ) allowed a 
brahmana to maintain himself and his family by agriculture, 
sale of commodities and money-lending only if he did not 
engage in these personally, but through the agency of others. 
Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 40 ) enjoins upon brahmanas and ksatriyas not 
to lend money like usurers and quotes two verses which 
define usury and say that a userer is a greater sinner than even 
one who is guilty of brahmana-murder. Manu (X. 117) also 
forbids usury to brahmanas and ksatriyas, but allows them to 
charge a low rate of interest to persons engaged in low actions. 
Narada ( rnadana 111 ) forbids usury to brahmanas even in 
the direst calamities. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 27. 10 ) prescribes a 
prayascitta 87 Â° for a brahmana lending money at usurious rates. 
Brhaspati as quoted 271 in the Gr. R. has a rather amusing 
verse 'sages have enumerated numerous means of livelihood, 
but out of all of them money-lending is pre-eminent. There 
is loss in agriculture due to draught, to the fear of the exactions 
of the king- and the ravages of rats and others, but there is 
no such loss in money-lending.* It appears that this is only a 
general or satirical statement and does not recommend money- 
lending to brahmanas. 

The obvious reasons and motives underlying these restric- 
tions on brahmanas were to make them live simple lives, to 
insist on the necessity and high value to themselves and to 
society of studying, preserving and augmenting the ancient 
literature and culture, to emphasize the fact that a highly 
spiritual life should not be given up for a mere secular life, 
to prevent the coarsening and hardening of the heart and 
emotions in a relentless and continuous pursuit of wealth or 
martial glory. 

Agriculture â In the dharmasastra works there is a great 
conflict of views about agriculture as an occupation for

brahmanas. The Vedic Literature does not condemn agriculture 
in the case of brahmanas. The gambler's song 278 ( Rg. X. 34 ) 
winds up with the exhortation 'do not play with dice, do engage 
in agriculture, thinking highly of my words ( or of wealth ), do 
find joy in wealth, in that ( in agriculture ) there are cows, there 
is your wife &c.' There are frequent references in Vedic Litera- 
ture to fields, ploughshares and tilling the soil ( vide Rg. X. 101. 3 
= Tai.S.IV.2.5.5, Vaj. S. XII. 67, Rg. 1. 110. 5, 1. 176. 2, X. 117. 
7 ). Baudhayana 873 says (1. 5. 101) ' The study of the Veda tends 
to the destruction of agriculture and ( devotion to ) agriculture 
tends to the loss ( of the study ) of the Veda. One who has the 
capacity ( to look after both ) may resort to both, but he who 
is unable ( to look after both ) should give up agriculture '. 
Baudhayana further says ( II. 2. 82-83 ) ' a brahmana should 
engage in agriculture before his morning meal and he should 
only coax again and again his oxen whose noses have not been 
pierced and whose testicles are not removed and without prodd- 
ing them with a pointed awl \ The Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 32-34 ) has a 
similar sutra, adds that in summer he shall water his beasts (in 
the morning ) and quotes Vaj. S. XII. 71. Manu ( X. 83-84 ) 
says 4 a brahmana or a ksatriya compelled to follow the 
avocations of a vaisya ( owing to difficulty of maintenance 
otherwise ) should by all means avoid agriculture which is full 
of injury to sentient beings and dependent on others ( labourers, 
oxen &c. ). Some regard agriculture as a good mode of liveli- 
hood but it is condemned by the good, (as) wood having an iron 
tip (i.e. the plough) strikes the earth and (the insects and 
germs) imbedded in the earth/ Manu IV. 5 designated agricul- 
ture by the word * pramrta ' ( pre-eminent in loss of life ). Harlta 
quoted 274 in Gr. R. p. 429 declares 'the ploughshare (i. e. 
agriculture ) carries with it destruction of life, therefore it is 
not for brahmanas ; but if he were to follow it ( agriculture ) in 
distress he should pursue it only till his object ( of tiding over

distress) is accomplished \ Parasara 87S (II. 2-4, 7, 14) allows a 
brahmana to engage in agriculture, but lays down certain 
restrictions. * The proper number of oxen to be yoked to the 
plough is eight, six being middling, four aro yoked only by the 
cruel and two by those who sacrifice the lives of their oxen ; he 
should not yoke an ox that is hungry, thirsty or tired, he should 
make the oxen work only for half the day and then bathe them 
in water, he should offer the five mahayajfias and other sacrifices 
with corn raised by himself engaging in agriculture, the sin of 
ploughing the earth for a day with an iron-tipped ploughshare is 
equal to that incurred by a fisherman fishing for a year; he 
should give J of the corn to the king, offer -Â£t to gods and ^ to 
brahmanas and then he may not be smeared with sin \ Harlta 
quoted by Apararka (p. 937) has a long prose passage on the treat- 
ment to be given to oxen by brahmanas and also Vrddha-Gau- 
tama ( Jiv. part % p. 571 ). Vrddha-Harlfca 876 ( VII. 179 and 182 ) 
says that agriculture is common to all varnas and agriculture, 
rearing cattle and service aro not forbidden to any. The above 
discussion shows how agriculture was viewed at different times 
and by different writers from different points of view. 

Sale and barter â We have seen above that a brahman a is 
allowed to maintain himself by trade in disfcress or difficulties 
( apad ). But there were very great restrictions as to what things 
could be gold by a brahmana, According to Gaufc. ( VII. 8-14 ) 
a brahmana should not engage in the sale of fragrant things 
( like sandal-wood ), fluids ( like oils, ghee &c. ), cooked food, 
sesame, hemp ( and hempen articles like bags ), ksauma ( linen ), 
deer-skin, dyed and cleanly washed clothes, milk and its products 
( like curds &c. ), roots, flowers, fruits, herbs ( used as drugs ), 
honey, meat, grass, water, deleterious drugs (like opium, poison), 
animals ( for being killed ), men (as slaved), barren cows, heifers 
and' cows liable to abortion. He adds ( Gautama VII. 15 ) 
that according to some a brahmana could not sell land, rice, 
yarn, goats and sheep, horses, bulls, freshly delivered cows and

oxen that are yoked to carts. These restrictions did not apply 
to a ksatriya engaging in trade. Ap. Dh. S. 1. 7. 20. 12-13 877 has a 
similar list but adds among forbidden articles of sale ' weapons, 
sticky things ( slesma, like lac ), young stalks ( tokma ), fer- 
mented liquids ( kinva ), the expectation of merit ( sukrtasa ) 
and says that among corns sesame and rice are on no account 
to be sold. Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 77-78 condemns the sale of 
sesame and rice by saying that he who sells them sells respec- 
tively his pitrs ( dead ancestors ) and his pranas. This arose 
probably from the close connection of sesame with sraddha and 
tarpana* Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 24-29 ) gives a similar list and adds 
a prohibition against the sale of stones, salt, silk, iron, tin, 
lead, all wild animals, all tame animals with uncloven hoofs 
and those that have a mane, birds and animals having fangs. 
It quotes a verse at II. 27 ( which is the same as Manu X. 92 ) 
' a brahmana immediately becomes a sinner by the sale of meat, 
lac and salt and he becomes a smdra by selling milk for three 
days \ About sesame, Baud. Dh. S. m ( II. 1. 76 ), Manu ( X. 
91 ) and Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 30 ) present the same verse ' If a man 
deals with sesame in any way other than eating them or using 
them for bathing (i. e. applying sesamum oil to the body before 
a bath ) and making a gift of them, becomes a worm and sinks 
together with his pitrs in the ordure of a dog \ But it appears 
that Vasistha 279 (II. 31), Manu (X. 90) allow the sale of sesame 
if a man engages in agriculture and himself produces them 
( but sale must be only for purposes of religious duties, according 
to Manu ). Yaj. (III. 39) and Narada ( rnadana 66 ) say that 
sesame may be bartered for an equal measure of other corn to raise 
means for religious purposes ( and for medicine also according 
to Narada). Manu (X. 86-89), Yaj. (III. 36-38), Narada (rnadana 
61-63 ) give long lists of articles that Brahmanas were forbidden 
to sell and that inolude a few more than those specified above. 
For example, Manu forbids the sale of bee's wax, kusa, indigo, 
while Yaj. adds soma, mud, blankets made of goat wool, hair 
( of camari deer ) and oilcakes ( pinyaka ) to things forbidden to

4-6, Harlfca ( as quoted by Apararka p. 1113 ) contain long lists 
of things the sale of which was forbidden to brahmanas. Apart 
from these negative rules, there are some that are positive and 
prescribe what may be sold. For example, the Baud. Dh. S. M| 
prescribes the sale of grass and wood in their natural state and 
quotes a verse ' Oh ! Brahmana, these are the articles you may 
sell, viz., domestic animals that have only one row of teeth, 
minerals except salt and threads ( i. e. cloth ) that are not coloured 
with some dye. * Narada 888 (rnadana 64-65) states ' a brahmana 
may sell dried wood and grass, except fragrant articles, eraka 
( a kind of grass ), rattan, cotton, roots, kusa grass; cereals that 
get split up of their own accord, badara and inguda among 
fruits, cords and threads of cotton provided they are not 
coloured \ Sahkha-Likhita also (as quoted by Apararka p. 933) 
have the same rules as Narada and further enjoin upon the 
brahmana not to higgle for the price but to have a fixed price. 

Yaj. ( III. 40 ) says that the sale of lac, salt and meat lead 
to a brahmana's fall ( i. e. he loses the right to perform the 
duties of dvijatis) and the sale of milk, curds and liquor reduces 
him to the status of a low class (i. e. of a sudra). Manu (XL 62), 
Visnu Dh. S. (37. 14) and Yaj. (III. 234) include the sale of for- 
bidden articles among upapatakas and Yaj. (III. 265) prescribes 
candrayana and other prayascittas for it. Harlta ( quoted by 
Apararka p. 1113 and Mit. on Yaj. III. 265 ) prescribes various 
prayascittas for the sale of various forbidden articles. Laghu- 
Satafcapa prescribes ( v. 87 ) candrayana for the sale of honey, 
meat, wine, soma, lac, salt. 888 Narada (rnadana 67 ) calls upon

the king to inflict a heavy fine upon a brahmana who engages 
in the sale of articles forbidden to be sold and strays from the 
path ( proper for brahmanas ) in the absence of distress. 

Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 7. 20. 14-15 ) m states the general rule that 
exchange or barter also of those articles that are forbidden to 
be sold cannot be resorted to, but adds that barter is allowed of 
foods with foods, of slaves with slaves, of fragrant things 
with other fragrant things, of one kind of learning with 
another. Gaufc. 285 (VII. 16-21) allows the exchange of 
rasas with rasas, of domestic animals with other domestic 
animals, of cooked food with an equal measure of uncooked 
food for immediate use, but forbids the barter of salt, cooked 
food and sesame with other articles. Manu ( X. 94 ) allows the 
exchange of ons rasa ( liquid like molasses ) with another (like 
ghee ), of cooked food with uncooked food, of sesame with an 
equal quantity of other corn, but does not allow the barter of 
salt for any rasa. Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 37-39 ) has rules similar 
to Manu and Ap. 886 

Manu ( X. 116 ) m enumerates ten means of maintaining 
oneself in apad ( distress ) viz. learning, arts and crafts, work 
for wages, service ( i. e. carrying out another's orders ), rearing 
cattle, sale of commodities, agriculture, contentment, alms, 
money-lending. Out of these some cannot be followed by a 
brahmana or a ksafcriya when there is no distress ( e. g. a 
brahmana cannot engage in service). Yaj. III. 42 enumerates seven 
of these and adds ' cart' ( i. e. driving curfcs for hire ), mountain 
( subsisting on the price of grass and fuel taken from hills ), a 
country full of water, trees and shrubs, king ( i. e. resorting 
to or begging from a king ). Chagaleya quoted in Gr. R. p. 449* 88

speaks of nine means of livelihood in a season of drought, 
viz, cart, plot of vegetables, cows, fishing, asyandana ( main- 
taining oneself by the slightest effort possible ? ), forest, a 
country full of water, trses and shrubs, a mountain, king. 
Narada (rnadana 50-55) says thut three modes of acquiring 
wealth are common to all, viz. inheritance, a gift of friendli- 
ness or affection and what comes to a man with a wife ( at the 
time of marriage); that each of the three varnas has three 
special modes of acquiring wealth, viz., receiving gifts, fees as 
priest and fees for teaching in the case of brahmanas ; booty in 
war, taxes and fines in judicial trials in the case of ksatriyas ; 
agriculture, rearing cattle and sale of commodities in the case 
of vaisyas. Narada ( rnadana verses 44-47 ) divides wealth into 
sukla ( white, pure ), sabala ( dark-white, mixed ) and krsna 
( dark ) and each of these into seven varieties. The Visnu Dh. S. 
chap. 58 also divides the wealth of householders into these three 
varieties and says that what is earned by the special modes 
prescribed for each varna, inherited wealth, gifts of affection 
and what comes with the wife-these are Sukla ( pure ); what is 
obtained by following the special avocation of the varna 
immediately lower than one's own varna and what is acquired 
by giving bribes or by sale of forbidden articles or from one 
who is under one's obligations is sabala ; what is obtained by 
following the avocations of a varna other than the immediately 
lower one and what is acquired by gambling, theft, violence or 
fraud is called krsna. Baud. Dh. S. ( III, 1. 5-6 ) speaks of ten 
kinds of vrttis ( means of livelihood ) and III. % explains them at 
length. Manu ( IV. 4-6 ) speaks of five ways of livelihood viz. 
rta ( i. e. subsisting on grains left in the fiolds ), amrta ( what 
comes without begging ), mrta (alms obtained by begging), 
pramrta ( agriculture ), satyanrta ( sale of commodities ) and 
forbids svavrtti ( service, lit. living like a dog ). Manu (IV. 9) 
further says that some brahmanas live by six means ( i. e. 
adhyapana, yajana, pratigraha, agriculture, rearing cattle and 
trade ), some by three ( viz. the first three ), some by two (yajana 
and adhyapana ) and others again only by one ( adhyapana ). 

The avocations practised by brahmanas in the pursuit of 
wealth were many and varied, so much so that from very 
ancient times the lists of brahmanas not eligible for invitation 
at sraddhas because they followed unworthy callings were very 
formidable. Atri (Anan. ed.) verses 373-383 names ten kinds of 
brahmanas and briefly defines them, viz. deva-brahmana ( who

daily performs bath, sarhdhya, japa, homa, worship of gods and 
honouring of guests and vaisvadeva), muni-br. (who is given 
up to staying in a forest, subsists on roots, fruits and vegetables 
and performs daily sraddhas ), dvija-br. ( who studies the 
Vedanta, gives up all attachments and is engaged in reflec- 
ting over Sarhkhya and Yoga ), ksatra-br. (who fights), vaisya-br. 
( who engages in agriculture, rearing cattle and trade ), sudra-br. 
(who sells lac, salt, dyes like kusumbha, milk, ghee, honey, 
meat ), nisada-br. ( who is a thief and robber, a backbiter and 
always fond of fish and meat ), pasu-br. ( who knows nothing 
about brahma and is only proud of his wearing the sacred 
thread ), mleccha-br. ( who obstructs or destroys wells, tanks, 
gardens, without any qualm )and candala-br. (who is a fool, 
devoid of prescribed rites, beyond the pale of all dharma 
and cruel). Atri (384) rather 289 humorously adds * those who 
are devoid of Vedic lore, study the sastras ( like grammar, logic 
&c. ), those devoid of sastric lore study puranas ( and earn 
money by reciting them ), those who are devoid even of purana 
reading become agriculturists, those who are devoid even of 
that become bhagavatas ( pose as great devotees of Siva or Visnu 
i. o. become what is called in modern Marathi 'buva' )/ Devala 
quoted 890 by Apararka ( pp. 284-285) speaks of eight kinds of 
brahmanas ( of whom each succeeding one is superior to each 
preceding one) viz. matra ( one who is only born in a brahmana 
family but has not studied any part of the Veda nor performs 
the actions appropriate to brahmanas ), brahmana ( who has 
studied a portion of the Veda ), srotriya ( who has studied one 
vedic sakha with the six angas and performs the six duties of 
brahmanas ), anucana (who knows the meaning of the Veda and 
the vedangas, is of pure heart and has kindled the sacred fires ), 
bhruna ( who besides being anucana always performs yajnas 
and eats what is left after performing yajnas), rsikalpa ( who 
has gained all worldly and Vedic knowledge, and has his mind

under control ), rsi (one who is celibate, of ausfcere life, of 
truthful speech and able to curse or favour ), muni ( to whom a 
clod of earth and gold are the same, who has ceased from all 
activity, is devoid of desires and anger &c. ). $atatapa 891 quoted 
by Apararka ( pp. 286-287 ) speaks of six classes of persons who, 
though born brahmanas, are really not brahmanas viz. one who 
has taken service with a king, one who engages in sale and 
purchase (of commodities), one who officiates for many 
yajamanas, one who is the officiating priest for the whole village, 
one who is in the service of a village or town, one who does not 
perform samdhya adoration in the morning and evening at the 
proper time. The Anusasanaparva ( 33. 11 ff) shows that some 
brahmanas were great rogues, others engaged in austerities, 
some resorted to agriculture and rearing cattle, others subsisted 
by begging, some were thieves and others were false, some were 
acrobats and dancers (but it yet recomnends that brahmanas 
must be honoured ). 

The smrtis teach that brahmanas doing certain things 
are to be treated as sudras. For example, Baud. 898 Dh, S. 
( II. 4. 20 ) requires a religious king to employ brahmanas who 
do not perform the morning and evening adoration ( samdhya ) 
in doing work appropriate to sudras. Vas. 893 Dh. S. ,( III. 1-2 ) 
says that brahmanas who are not srotriyas ( learned in the 
Veda ), who do not teach the veda or who do not kindle the 
sacred fires become reduced to the status of sudras and quotes a 
Manava sloka ( Manu II. 168 ) * that a brahmana who without 
studying the Veda works hard to master something else is 
quickly reduced while still living to the status of a sudra 
together with his family/ Manu ( VIII. 102 = Baud. Dh. S. I.

5. 95) asks the king to treat as siidras brahmanas who engage in 
rearing cattle, in the sale of commodities, who are artisans and 
actors, who are mere servants and money-lenders. Vide Manu 
X. 92 quoted above ( p. 127 ). Parasara ( VIIL 24 ) says m that a 
brabmana who does not repeat the Gayatrl mantra is more impure 
than even a sudra and that brahmanas who do not offer 
oblations to sacred fires, who are bereft of samdhya adoration 
and who do not study the veda are all sudras and that therefore 
one should study at least a portion of the veda if he cannot 
study the whole. Manu (V. 4) 295 sums up in one place the 
reasons why brahmanas are seized by Death before the allotted 
span of human life ' on account of not studying the Vedas, on 
account of giving up the rules of conduct prescribed for them, 
through idleness and through the faults arising from ( partaking 
forbidden ) food, Death desires to kill brahmanas.' 

A few words must be said about begging. The smrtis 
prescribe begging as specially appropriate to brahmacarins (vedio 
students) and ascetics (yatis), which will be dealt with at 
length later on. Begging was not allowed to others except under 
considerable restrictions. The king of Kekaya 896 is made to 
boast in the Mahabharata ( Santi 77. 22 ) that no one who 
is not a brahmacarin begs in his kingdom. Gifts of food 
were to be made daily while performing the five mahayajnas 
( this will be treated under vaisvadeva ). Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 
1-4 recognizes that begging can properly be resorted to for the 
following reasons, viz. for the teacher, for ( one's first) marriage, 
for a sacrifice, in anxiety to support one's parents, for warding 
off the non-observance of the duties of a worthy person ; he 
enjoins that on these occasions there is a duty to give according 
to one's ability and according to the worth of the person begging 
and that if a man begs only for the gratification of his senses 
( afld not for pressing wants ) one should pay no heed to such 89?

begging. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 2-3 says that ' a man oppressed 
by hunger may beg for a little viz. a cultivated or uncultivated 
plot, a cow, a sheep or ewe, and at last gold, corn or cooked 
food; but a snataka should not faint through hunger; this 
is the instruction'. Vide Manu X. 114 for practically the 
same words and Visnu Dh. S. 3. 79-80. Baud Dh. S. II. 1. 64 
includes begging by one who has finished his course of 
sfcudentbood among actions that make a man impure (a&icihara). 
Manu XL 16-17 says that when a person has had no food 
for* three days he may take away ( by theft even ) from 
one who is lower than himself in class as much corn as will be 
enough for one day, either from the threshing floor or from the 
field or from his house or from whatever place he can get it, but 
he should announce his action when the owner asks. Gaut. 
( 18. 28-30 ) and Yaj, III. 43 are to the same effect. Angiras 898 
quoted in Gr. R. ( p. 450.) allows begging to the diseased, the indi- 
gent, to one who is torn away from his family and who is on a 
journey. Sankha-Likhita 8 " as quoted in Gr.R. (p. 457) say ' when 
a man begs he should state the purpose ( such as marriagej 
completion of sacrifice ) of his begging; he should not beg of a 
woman or of those who are minors or unable to conduct 
their affairs, nor when the donor is not in a proper place or at a 
proper time. He should apply the alms to the purpose for which he 
begged. He should give that portion of the alms which remains 
unused to priests or any other excellent person'. Vas. Dh. S. 
( III. 4 ) and Parasara 20 Â° ( I. 60 ) call upon the king to fine that 
village where persons of the higher classes wander about begg- 
ing though they are not observers of vows ( like brahmacarins ) 
and are not studying the Veda. The foregoing will show that 
indiscriminate begging was never allowed or encouraged by the 
smrtis even for brahmanas, much less for others. 

It has been seen above how even during the Vedic perTod 
brahmanas had come to be highly eulogised as if they were 
gods and held superior merely on account of birth. The

Ch. Ill ] High eulogy of brGhmarias 135 

Tai. Br. III. 7- 3 says ' One should sacrifice in the right 
hand of a brahmana ; the brahmana indeed is Agni-vai6va- 
nara\ Vide Santiparva 343. 13-14, Manu IV. 117, Likhita 
31, Vas. Dh. S. 30. 2-5. The same ideas of the sacredness and 
the superiority of brahmanas were carried forward and further 
emphasized by the dharma-&astra works. Most exaggerated 
and hyperbolical descriptions of the greatness of brahmanas 
are sown broadcast over all the smrfcis and the puranas. It is 
not possible to set out even a small fraction of them. But 
a few passages may usefully be cited here by way of samples. 
The Visnu Dh. S. 301 ( 19. 20-22 ) says ' the gods are invisible 
deities, but brahmanas are visible deities; the worlds are 
supported by brahmanas ; the gods stay in heaven by the 
favour of brahmanas ; words spoken by brahmanas never come 
to be untrue \ Manu ( I. 100 ) declares ' whatever 802 wealth 
exists on this earth â all that belongs to the brahmana; the 
brahmana deserves everything on account of his superiority 
due to his descent ( from the mouth of the Creator ).' Manu 
IX. 313-321 contain a hyperbolical eulogy of the power of 
brahmanas, two of which may be set out ' who would prosper 
if he oppresses brahmanas that, when angered, might create 
other worlds and other guardians of the worlds and that might 
deprive the deities of their position as deities ' ( 315 ) ; 'a 
brahmana, whether learned or not, is a great deity ' ( verse 317 ). 
Manu XI. 84 is 'a brahmana by the very fact of his birth is 
an object of honour even to the deities. ' Parasara (VI. 52-53 ) 
holds ' whatever defects there may be in vratas, in austerities, or 
in sacrificial rites, they all vanish when brahmanas support them. 
Whatever words are spoken by brahmanas are spoken by the 
gods ; brahmanas have all the gods in them and therefore 
their words do not fail. ' 8os The Mahabharata indulges in very

while the latter pays eight times as much if he knowingly commits it.

frequent eulogies of brahmanas. Adiparva (28. 3-4) says m 
' a brahmana, when provoked, becomes fire, the sun, poison, 
and weapon ; a brahmana is declared to be the guru of all 
beings.' Vanaparva 805 ( 303. 16 ) says ' a brahmana is the highest 
light, he is the highest tapas ; the sun shines in heaven on 
account of the salutations made by the brahmanas \ This and 
similar dicta closely follow what was expressed in the Vedic 
period long before e. g. c the sun would not rise if the 
brahmana did not make sacrifice ' ( Satapatha II. 3, 1, 5 ) ; the 
refrain of Rg. II. 15. 2-9 is that Indra performed his great and 
heroic works under the intoxication of the soma ( offered by 
the priests in sacrifices ). Rg. IV. 50. 7-9 say that a king and 
others for whom the purohifca offers prayers win battles, secure 
booty and help from gods. Anusasana-parva 306 ( 33. 17 ) says 
* they may make a non-deity into a deity and a deity into a 
non-deity ; that man may become a king whom they desire to 
be so, and he who is not desired by them may be defeated. ' 
Santi ( 56. 22 ) declares c In this world brahmana is the highest 
being \ 

It should not be supposed that the brahmanas inserted 
these eulogies solely for the purpose of increasing their 
importance and tightening their hold on the other classes. If 
the other classes had not themselves more or less shared these 
ideas, no amount of iteration on the part of brahmanas would 
have given them the influence which they as a matter of fact 
wielded. Their influence was a growth of centuries and they 
themselves were as much parts of the huge edifice of the caste 
system as the other varnas. Besides the brahmanas had no 
military force behind them. They could only succeed in 
influencing the other varnas by persuasion and their own 
worth. The brahmanas were the creators and custodians of the 
vast literature that had grown up, they were the guardians of 
the culture of ages, they were expected to shoulder the burdens 
of teaching and preserving the vast literature on such gifts as 
were voluntarily made. Though many among them did not

live up to the high ideals set up for their order, there must have 
been not a few who made as near an approach to the fulfilment 
of the ideal as possible. It was the greatness of these latter 
that led to the glorification of the whole order to which they 
belonged. Learning and tapa* are more or less elusive and 
impalpable, while birth from brahmana parents was quite an 
apparent and palpable thing. Therefore that was seized upon by 
some writers as the principal reason for the respect to be given 
to brahmanas. For centuries human societies have everywhere 
acquiesced in the government and control exercised by small 
coteries of the elite, generally the elite of birth, who have 
guided the destinies of their societies on traditional lines of 
religious and social order. It must be remembered that the 
smrti works also extol the office of the king ( which was 
generally hereditary and is so even now ) to the skies. Manu 
( VII. 4-11 ) propounds 807 the theory that the king has in him the 
parts of such gods as Indra and that a king is a great deity in 
human form. The theory of varnas as conceived by Manu and 
other smrtikaras was based upon the idea of the division of 
labour, on the idea of balancing the rival claims of various 
sections of the community ; it laid greatest emphasis upon the 
duties of the varnas rather than upon their rights and privileges. 
It raised the brahmana to the highest pinnacle of reverence, 
but at the same time it placed before him the ideal of not 
hankering after temporal power, of leading a life of compara- 
tive poverty and of making his knowledge available to the 
other classes for a scanty and precarious return. It made the 
military caste feel that they were not all-in-all, but had 
to look up to some other class as superior to themselves. 
European writers severely condemn brahmanas for their greed, 
selfishness and constant praises of gifts to themselves. But 
they forget to take account of the circumstances under which 
the brahmanas were forced to sing the praises of gifts to them. 
The ideal before brahmanas was to lead a life of comparative 
poverty ; they were forbidden to follow many worldly pursuits 
and depended on the generosity of their patrons. They did not 
live in monasteries as Buddhist and Christian monks did nor 
were they entitled to fixed and fat salaries like the bishops in 
some Christian countries. They had further to bring up their 
own families and pupils and had themselves also to make gifts to 
others. In modern capitalist societies those who have brains

and knowledge tend to become financiers and capitalists, all 
wealth is centred in their hands, they reduce most other men 
to mere wage-earners who are often hardly better than helots. 
While finding fault with the brahmana writers of over two 
thousand years ago for the eulogies they bestowed upon 
themselves, one should not forget that even in the 20th century 
when the pursuit of scientific studies is professed to have 
reached its zenith, we hear ecstatic and arrogant eulogies of 
the white ma^s burden, of the great and glorious achievements 
of the Nordic race and the greater and more glorious future it 
is destined to attain ( vide the very first sentence in Spengler's 
'The Decline of the West', English translation by C. F. 
Atkinson ). The brahmanas never arrogated to themselves the 
authority to depose kings and to hand over vast territories for 
ever to whomsoever they liked, as Pope Alexander VI by his 
Bull of 1493 made over the New World to Isabella of Castille 
and Ferdinand of Aragon ( vide Dean Inge's * Christian Ethics 1 
1930 p. 160 where this astounding Bull is set out ). 

It has been seen already that brahmanas had the special 
privileges of teaching, officiating as priests and accepting gifts 
made as a religious duty. It is desirable that a comprehensive 
list of all the privileges claimed by brahmanas ( though not 
always conceded as the sequel will show ) should be set out 
once for all. 

(1) The brahmana was to be guru( object of reverence ) S88 
to all varnas by the mere fact of birth. Ap. Dh. & ( I. 1. 1. 5 ) 
says so. Vas. Dh. S. ( IV. 1 ) says ' the system of four varnas is 
distinguished by its origin and by the special features of the 
sacraments ( each of them undergoes )' and quotes Rg. X. 90. 12 
in support. Manu ( I. 31 and 94 ) says that the Creator produced 
the four varnas respectively from his mouth, arms, thighs and 
feet, that ( I. 93 ) the brahmana is by right the master of this

( of his caste ), on account of his superiority of origin ( from the 
mouth of the Creator ), on account of his submitting himself to 
discipline ( or holding up Vedic lore) and on account of the 
eminence of the sacraments ( samskaras ) in his case \ Bhisma- 
parva ( 121. 35 ) says that the brahmana is superior among all 
castes. This sense of superiority was carried so far that Apa- 
stamba 309 (1.4.14.23), Manu (11.135) and Visnu Dh. S. 
(32. 17 ) say that a brah mail a only ten years old was to be 
honoured as a father by a ksatriya 100 years old. 

(2) The brahmana was to expound the duties of all other 
classes, to indicate to them proper conduct and their means of 
livelihood and they were to abide by his directions and the 
king was to rule in accordance with such directions ( Vas. Dh. 
S. I. 39-41, Manu VII. 37, X. 2 ). This is supported by the 
words of the Katbakasamhita 310 ( IX. 16 ) and the Tai. Br. that 
the brahmana is indeed the supervisor over the people. The Ait. 
Br. ( 37. 5 ) declares that where the might of ksatriyas is under 
the control ( or direction ) of brahmanas that kingdom becomes 
prosperous, that kingdom is full of heroes 5U &c. This idea is 
somewhat similar to the teaching of Plato who held that 
philosophers that had undergone a special training were to rule 
and were to be politicians, that the government of the best 
( aristocracy ) was the ideal system. The problem is how to find 
out the best. Ancient India solved it by leaving the decision of 
knotty points to the learned brahmanas and the execution of the 
decisions arrived at by them to the king and the ksatriyas. 

(3) ' The king was the ruler of all, except brahmanas- 
Gautama 312 XL 1. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 4 explains that these 
words were only laudatory of the greatness of brahmanas and 
were not to be taken literally and that the king could punish 
brahmanas in appropriate cases. These words of Gautama are 
a mere echo of certain passages like those in the Vaj. S. ( IX 40 ) 
and the Sat. 313 Br. ( V. 4. 2. 3 and IX. 4. 3. 16 ), where it is said

4 Soma is the king of us brahmanas \ The idea was that 
brahmanas had to prepare soma and offer it in sacrifices to the 
gods i.e. they held all wealth for Soma and owed all allegiance to 
Soma, while other people owed allegiance only to the king. The 
brahmanas alone were to eat the sacrificial food and drink Soma 
( and ksatriyas were to drink only a substitute for Soma ). Vide 
Ait. Br. ( chap. 35 khanda 4 ). In the Mahabharata, however 
many kings are described as Somapas. So the practice of not 
allowing the ksatriyas to drink soma was not universally 
accepted. Further it was probably not a privilege at all, but 
only indicates that Soma sacrifices had been mostly neglected 
by all except brahmanas. 

(4) ' The king should exonerate ( the brahmana ) in the 
six matters, viz. ( a brahmana ) should not be beaten ( whipped ), 
he should not have fetters put on him, he should not be mulcted 
in fines of money, he should not be driven out ( of the village or 
country), he should not be censured, he should not be abandoned- 
Gaut. VIII. 81 * 14-13. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 4 explains that these 
words are not applicable to every brahmana, but only to deeply 
learned brahmanas described in the preceding sutras (Gaut. VIII. 
4-11 ). Haradatta adds that even a learned brahmana is treated 
in this way only if he commits an offence without pre-medi- 
tation but only through ignorance or oversight. As to corporal 
punishment for brahmana offenders, the matter stands thus. Gaut 
XII. 43 says that there is no corporal punishment for a brahmana 
( even when he being a thief comes to the king confessing his 
guilt and asking the king to beat him with a heavy club on 
the head ). Vide Manu XI. 99-100 also. Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 10. 
18-19 ) first lays down that a brahmana is to undergo no beating 
for any offence but allows for a brahmana guilty of the 
mortal sins ( of brahm ana-murder, incest, drinking liquor, theft 
of gold) the punishment of branding on the forehead with red- 
hot iron and banishment from the country. Manu IX. 237 
(= Matsyapurana 227. 163-164), Visnu Dh. S. V. 4-7 prescribe the

rarious figures that were to be branded on the forehead of a 
brahmana in the case of various offences. Manu ( VIII. 
379-380 ) prescribes shaving of the head for brahmana offenders 
where others would have had to suffer the extreme penalty of 
death and adds that a brahmana was not to be sentenced to death 
whatever offence he might have committed and that he is to be 
banished from the country taking with him all his possessions. 
Even on this the Mit. ( on Yaj. II. 81 ) observes that it applies 
only when it is the brahmana's first offence ( i. e. he may be 
fined for repeating an offence ). Yaj. ( II, 270 ), Narada ( sahasa, 
verse 10 ) and Sankha 315 prescribe branding and banishment as 
punishment for brahmanas ( particularly in the case of theft ). 
The brahmana was never above being fined. Manu ( VIII. 123 ) 
prescribes fine and banishment for a perjured brahmana witness, 
while Manu VIII. 378 prescribes heavy fines for a brahmana 
guilty of rape or adultery. The Mit. on 316 Yaj. II. 302 quotes 
a verse of Manu ( not found in the extant Manusmyti ) that in 
the case of the brahmana corporal punishment takes the form 
of complete shaving of the head, he is liable to banishment from 
the town, he may be branded on the forehead and he may be 
made to ride through the town on the back of an ass ( looked 
upon at all times as the highest form of indignity )â¢ Kaut 
also 3,v ( IV. 8) forbids corporal punishment for brahmanas in 
all offences but prescribes branding on the forehead in the same 
way as Manu (IX. 237) and also banishment and labour on mines. 
But Kau^. makes an exception, viz. he allows a brahmana 
to be drowned in water if he is guilty of high treason, or of 
forcible entry in the king's harem or of inciting the enemies of 
the king &c. Katyayana 318 ( quoted by Visvarupa on Yaj. II.

latter is guilty of the destruction of a foetus, of theft, of

striking a brahmana woman wifch a weapon and of killing an 
innocent; woman. The Mifc. on Yaj. III. 257 thinks it possible 
that kings sentenced brahmanas to death in spite of the prohibi- 
tion of corporal punishment and we h'\ve a classical illustra- 
tion in the death sentence passed on the brahmana Carudatta by- 
king Palaka in the Mrcchakatika (IX). The foregoing discussion 
shows that the only special privilege claimed for the brahmana 
in the law courts of the land was freedom from death sentence 
or other corporal punishment like whipping, though rarely he 
was liable to be sentenced to death also. He was subject to 
the indignities of branding and being paraded on the back of an 
ass, to fines and banishment. These claims were very mode- 
rate as compared with the absurd lengths to which the doctrine 
of ' benefit of clergy ' was carried in England and other western 
countries. 319 The clergyman in England was not by birth, he had 
to be ordained. Yet clergymen claimed that an ordained clerk, 
a monk or nun charged with serious offences called felonies 
could be tried only by an ecclesiastical court and this was 
conceded by the ordinary courts ; this privilege was gradually 
extended to persons not ordained viz. to doorkeepers, readers , 
exorcists ( all of whom merely assisted the clergy ) and 
finally to all who could read or pretended to read a few words 
from the Bible. Holdsworth, Pollock and Maitland admit that 
the procedure in the ecclesiastical courts was little better than a 
farce ( P and M vol. I. p. 426, Holdsworth vol. Ill p. 296 ). The 
ecclesiastic courts never pronounced a judgment of blood, the 
bishop only deprived the offending clerk of orders, and relegated 
him to a monastery, or kept him in prison for life or a shorter 
period and very rarely whipping and branding were ordered. 
Even in the first quarter of the 20th century, European British 
subjects and Europeans and Americans in general could claim in 
British India some startling privileges when charged with crimi- 
nal offences which even the brahmanas of over two thousand years 
ago did not claim. For example, under Sec. 443 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code of India ( as it existed before 1923 ) 
they could not be tried by any Indian Magistrate ( however 
Benior and experienced ) and that in serious cases like murder, 
even a Sessions Judge who was himself an European British

subject could not sentence an European British subject to more 
than one year's imprisonment ( Section 449 ). Any European 
or American could claim to be tried by a mixed jury of which 
not less tban one half had to be Europeans or Americans, while 
an Indian offender could not claim the privilege in his own 
country that not less than one half of the jury that tried him 
must be Indians. In England even now a peer indicted for 
treason or felony must be tried by bis peers and not by the 
tribunals that try ordinary men (vide Halsbury's Laws of 
England, 2nd Ed. vol. 25 p. 46 ). The brahrainas had to 
submit to trial in the ordinary courts and the smrfcis do not 
generally provide for trial of brahmanas in special ecclesias- 
tical courts of their own class. The only approach to this 
western doctrine of benefit of clergy is to be found in the 
Ap. Dh. S. t m whare it is said that the teacher and others who 
have authority over a brahmana guilty of transgressions should 
prescribe prayoscitfcas for him : if he does not abide by their 
orders, he should be taken to the king who should hand him 
over to his own purohita ; the latter was to prescribe prayas- 
cittas ( penances for atonement) for brahmana offenders. If the 
latter did not carry out the penances then he was to break 
them by disciplines according to their ability except that he 
( the purohita ) was not to prescribe corporal punishment and 
slavery for brahmaria offenders. 

(5) Most smrtis lay down that a srotriya ( a brahmana 
learned in the Veda) was to* be free from taxes. Certain 
passages of the Sat. Br. suggest that even in those times 
brahmanas were not taxed. 221 Ap. Dh. S. S22 II. 10. 26. 10, 
Vas. Dh. S. 19. 23, Manu VII. 133 say this. Some claimed this 
exemption for all brahmanas e. g. Vas. Dh. S. ( I. 42-43 ) says 
" a king ruling over his subjects according to the rules of the 
sastra should take the sixth part of all wealth except from 
brahmanas"; the Visnu Dh. S. III. 26 says 'a king should

not recover taxes from brahmanas \ Kaut. ,w ( IT. 1 ) requires the 
king to make gifts of brahmadeya lands to rtviks ( who officiate 
at solemn sacrifices), teachers, purohitas, srotriyas, that will 
yield substantial produce and on which no fines and taxes 
will be levied. The reason assigned was the belief that the king 
shared in the religious merit accumulated by the brahmanas. 
Vas. * u ( I. 44-46 ) explains ' ( freedom from taxation is 
there ) because he ( the king ) secures the sixth part of the 
istapurta ( the merit due to sacrifices and performing charitable 
works of public utility) and it is declared ( in a Brahmana text ) 
that the brahmana enriohes the Veda, he relieves ( others ) from 
calamities and therefore the brahmana is not a source of 
subsistence (i. e. should not be taxed by the king ) since Soma is 
his king ; and it is further declared that bliss awaits after death 
(the king who does not tax brahmanas).' The Visnu Dh. S. 
III. 27 Fays ' they render unto him the tax of religious merit \ 
Manu VII. 136 says 4 by the religious merit which the srotriya 
accumulates every day when protected by the king, the 
king's life, wealth and kingdom increase. ' Vide Manu 8. 
305. This sentiment is expressed even by a great poet 
like Kalidasa* 85 'forest-dwellers give a sixth part of their 
tapas ( merit due to austerities ) to the king and that is an 
inexhaustible treasure \ It is further to be noted that not only 
srotriyas, but also many other persons were free from taxation. 
Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 10. 26. 11-17 ) exempts from taxation all women 
of the four varnas, all boys before they show signs of manhood 
( i. e. before they attain majority ), those who stay with their 
teachers for learning ( even though they may be grown up), 
those engaged in austerities and devoted to right practices, a 
sudra who washes the feet ( of men of the three higher classes ), 
the blind, the dumb and the diseased, those who are for- 
bidden to possess wealth ( i. e. ascetics etc. ). The Vas. Dh. S.

persons, ascetics, minors, senile men ( above 70 ), young men, 
and women who are recently delivered. Manu VIII. 394 con- 
tains a similar provision. Brhat-Paraiara m (chap. Ill, 
Jiv. part II p. 113 ) says ' a brahmana engaged in agriculture 
had to pay nothing to anybody \ It is extremely doubtful 
whether in actual practice kings respected all these rules. Note 
275 shows that a brahmana engaging in agriculture had to pay 
Jth of the produce just as others did. An inscription of Vikrama- 
ditya V. found near Gadag dated sake 934 ( 1012 A. D. ) refers 
to taxes levied even on upanayana, marriages and vedic sacri- 
fices ( E. L vol. XX pp. 64 and 70 ). The Santiparva ( 76. 2-10 ) 
contains anlnteresting disquisition on the taxation of brahmanas. 
Those brahmanas who have mastered all the lores and who treat 
all equally well are called brahmasama. Those brahmanas who 
have studied the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda and who 
stick to the peculiar duties of their class are styled devasama 
( verses 2 and 3 ). A religious king should make those who are 
not srotriyas and who do not kindle the sacred fires render 
taxes and forced labour ( verse 5 ). Then certain brahmanas are 
described as ksatrasama and vaisiyasama. A king whose 
treasury is empty should levy taxes from all brahmanas except 
those that are desoribed as brahmasama and devasama. 828 Even 
if these rules were honoured, the claim was not very excessive. 
The brahmanas who ministered to the religious wants of the people 
and who were to conserve the religious literature and spiritual 
inheritance of the country and to teach without the liberty to 
make a contract for fees were never entitled to raise taxes from 
the people for their benefit. According to the practioe of the 
Roman Catholic Church * the clergy owed no allegiance to the 
secular power ; they were not under the laws of the land, they 
paid no taxes to the State. All benefices were put under the 
Holy See and the Roman chancery compiled a tariff of prices 
for which each might be bought '. It would take too long to

(6) In the matter of treasure trove the brahmana was more 
favourably treated than members of other classes. If a treasure 
was found by a learned brahmana he was entitled to keep the 
whole of it ; in other cases the treasure belonged to the king, 
except a sixth part which was given to the finder if he honestly 
informed the king about the finding of the treasure. If a king 
himself found buried treasure, he was to distribute half of it 
among brahmanas and was to keep for himself the other half. 
Vide Gautama' (X. 43-45 ), Vas Dh. S. (III. 13-14), Manu 
(VIII. 37-38), Yaj. II. 34-35, Visnu Dh. S. (III. 56-64), 
Narada ( asvamivikraya verses 7-8 ). 

(7) The general rule about the property of one dying heir- 
less is that it escheats to the king, but there was an exception 
in the case of an heirless brahmana. Such property was to be 
distributed among srotriyas or brahmanas. Vide Gautama 820 
28. 39-40, Vas. Dh.S.17. 84-87, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 118-122, Manu

(8) The rule of the road was in favour of brahmanas even 
as against the king. If on a road there was a crowd or obstruc- 
tion, precedence was to be given to the cartman, to a very old 
man, to one suffering from a disease, to a woman, to a snataka,to 
the king; but a king was to give precedence to a 6rotriya-Gaut.

Ch. Ill ] Brahmana and precedence on a raid 147 

give precedence to fools, patita % the intoxicated and lunatics 
and a person of a lower varna should give precedence to one of 
a higher varna. The Mahabharata ( Vanaparva 133. 1 ) adds 
the blind and the deaf, ( Anu^asana 104. 25-26) cows, a pregnant 
woman and a weak man. Vas. Dh. S. (13.58-60) enumerates the 
same persons, but says that the snataka ( one who has just 
returned from his stay with his guru ) has precedence over the 
king and that the bride has precedence over all when being 
taken in a procession ( to the house of the bridegroom ). Manu 
II. 138-139 has the same list and prefers the snataka to the 
king ; Yaj. I. 117 has the same rules. Sankha ( quoted in the 
Mit. on Yaj I. 117) mentions the view of some that the king has 
precedence over the brahmana, but disapproves of it. Vide 
Brahmapurana 113. 39 for a list. The Markancleyapurana ( 34. 
39-41) has a long list which includes a prostitute and one who is 
an enemy. The Visnu Dh. S. ( V. 91 ) prescibes a fine of 25 
karsapanas for him who does not give precedence on the road to 
one who deserves it. It will be conceded by every one that the 
above rules ( except the one about the precedence of brahmanas 
over even the king ) are quite reasonable and are informed by a 
spirit of humanity and chivalry. The rule about learned 
brahmanas probably owes its origin to the emphasis laid on the 
importance of the diffusion of learning ( which was not the 
direct concern of the state in those days, but of the brahmanas ) 
and the superiority of knowledge over mere brute force or 
military achievements. 

(9) The person of the brahmana was regarded as very 
sacred from ancient times and so brahmahatya ( killing a

( V. 3. 12. 1-2 ) says that he who performs the horse-sacrifice

murder. The Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1 narrates how Indra incurred the

him down as ' brahmahan \ In the Sat. Br. XIII. 3. 1. 1 we

a verse declaring hrShmana murder as one of the five mortal sins 
(mahapatakas). Gaufc. (21. 1) places the murderer of a brahmana 
at the head of his list of patitas ( persons guilty of mortal sins ). 
Vas. Dh. S. ( I. 20 ) uses the word bhruriahatya} u Manu XL 54, 
Visnu Dh. S. 35. 1, Yaj. III. 227 enumerate five mahapatakas of 
which brahmana-murder is one. Manu VIII. 381 declares that 
there is no worse sin in the world than brahmana-murder. 

A question that very much exercised the minds of all 
smrtikaras and writers of digests 8 * 5 was whether a brahmana 
who was himself guilty of violence or serious offences could be 
killed in self-defence by one attacked. The dicta of the smrtis 
are somewhat conflicting. Manu IV. 162 lays down a general 
rule prohibiting himsa ( death or injury ) of one's teacher ( of 
Veda), expounder (of the meaning of the Veda ), one's parents, 
one's other teachers ( or elders ), brahmanas, cows and all 
persons engaged in austerities. Manu XL 89 lays down that 
there is no expiation ( prayascitta ) that will wipe off the sin 
of intentionally killing a brahmana. But Manu himself 
(VIII. 350-351 = Visnu Dh.S. V. 189-190 =Matsyapurana 227. 
115-117 = Vrddha-Harita IX. 349-350) says 'one may surely 
kill without hesitation a man who comes down upon one as an 
atatayin 326 ( a desperate character or violent man ), whether he 
be a teacher, a child or an old man or a learned brahmana. In 
killing an atatayin, the killer incurs no sin ( or fault ), whether 
he kills him in the presence of people or alone ; (in such a case) 
wrath meets wrath \ Vas. Dh. S. ( III. 15-18 ) expressly says 
* by killing an atatayin they say the killer incurs no sin 
whatever f and quotes three verses * an incendiary, a poisoner, 
one armed with a weapon, a robber, one who wrests a field or 
carries away one's wife â these six are called atatayin. When 

334. The word 'bhru*na' has several meanings. Baud. Gr. (I. 4. 8) 
says that bbruna is one who knows the whole Vedic lore of his 6akha up 
to sutra and pravacana (bhasja ? ) ; Vaik. (LI) says that bhrHna is a 
brahmana learned in the Veda who has performed soma sacrifices. Vide 
note 290 above. Gaut. 21. 9 uses the word in the sense of 'garbha (foetus), ' 
while in Gaut. 17. 9 * bbrHnaha ' is equal to * brahraaha \ Both Baud 
Dh. S. I. 5. 94 and Vas. Dh. S. It. 42 quote a verse where bhrQnaha 
means brahmaha, while Vas. Dh. S. 20. 23 gives two meanings to it. 

335. Vide VisVarupa on Yaj. III. 222 and the Mit. on Yaj II. 21, 
AparSrka pp. 1042-44, Sm. C. ( VyavahSra pp. 313-15. ).

an atatSyin comes ( to attack ) with the desire to kill (or harm), 
one may kill him even though he be a complete master of 
Vedanta; by so doing one does not become a brahmana- 
murderer. If a person kills one who has studied the Veda and 
who is born of a good family, because the latter is an atatayin, 
he does not thereby become a brahm ana-murderer as in that 
case fury meets fury.' m In the Santiparva ( 34. 17 and 19 ) 338 
we have similar verses ' If a brahmana approaches wielding a 
weapon in a battle and desirous of killing a person, the latter 
may kill him even if the former be a complete master of the 
Veda. If a person kills a brahmana atatayin who has swerved 

from right conduct, he does not thereby fury \ Udyoga- 

parva ( 178. 51-52 ) says that, if a man kills in a battle a 
brahmana who fights like a ksatriya, it is a settled rule that he 
does not incur the sin of brahm ana- murder. Santi ( 22. 5-6 ) 
is to the same effect. The Visnu Dh. S. ( V. 191-192 ) speaks 
of seven persons as atatayin viz. * one who has a weapon ready 
to strike, one who is about to set fire or administer poison, one 
who has raised his hand to give a curse, who sets about to kill 
by the magic rites mentioned in the Atharvaveda ( e. g. suoh 
suktas as 1. 19, II. 19, III. 1-2, VII. 108 ), one who is a back- 
biter and informs the king, one who violates or assaults 
another's wife.' The Matsyapurana (227. 117-119) is practically 
to the same effect. Sumantu as quoted by the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 21) 
and by Apararka ( p. 1043 ) "says * there is no sin in killing 
an atatayin except a oow or a brahmana \ SS9 This implies that 
a brahmana even if an atatayin should not be killed, but if he 
be killed sin is incurred. Katyayana 3 * ( quoted in the Sm. C. 
and other digests ) declares that one should not kill a brahmana 
who is eminent by reason of his tapas, Vedic study and birth, 
even though he be an atatayin; Bhrgu allows killing when the 
offender is of a lower caste than that of brahmana'. Brhaspati 841 
also says that he who would not kill a brahmana atatayin 

337. This last vorse is also quoted in Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 14 and the 
latter half of it is tho same as Santiparva 15. 55.

deserving to be killed for his violence would obtain the merit 
of an A&vamedha sacrifice. 

Commentators and writers of digests differ in their interpre- 
tations. Visvarupa uz ( on Yaj. III. 222 ) remarks that he is 
guilty of brahmana-murder who kills a brahmana except in 
battle or except when the latter is an atatayin, or who kills a 
brahmana ( not an atatayin nor fighting ) on his own account 
without being employed by another or who brings about the 
death of such a brahmana by hiring another to perpetrate the 
murder for money. He further adds that the man who kills a 
brahmana at the instigation of another for money is not guilty 
of the sin of brahmana-murder, but it is the instigator who is so 
guilty on the analogy of the rule that the merit or fruit of a 
sacrifice belongs to him on whose behalf the rfcviks perform it. 
The Mit. 343 on Yaj. ( II. 21 ) says that the real purport of Manu 
VIIL 350-351 is not to ordain that a brahmana must be killed 
if he is an atatayin, but those two verses are only an arthavada 
( laudatory or recommendatory dicta), the real meaning being 
that even a guru and a brahmana who are most highly honoured 
and who are not fit to be killed at all, may have to be killed if 
atatayins ( then what of others ? ). The final conclusion of the 
Mit. is that if a brahmana who is an atatayin is being opposed 
in self-defence without any desire to kill him and if he dies 
through mistake or inattention, then the killer incurs no 
punishment at the hand of the kirn? and has to undergo a slight 
prayascitta i. e. there is really a prohibition to kill an atatayin 
brahmana and verses like Manu VIII. 351 refer to an atatayin 
who is not a brahmana. Medhatibhi appears to have held 
the Bame view ( on Manu VIII. 350-351 ). Kulluka explains 
Manu VIII. 350 as meaning that * a guru or a brahmana or others 
coming as atatayins may be killed when it is impossible to save 
oneself even by fleeing from them '. Apararka is of opinion m

that where an atatayin brahmana cannot be prevented from his 
wicked intent exoept by killing him, there only the 6astras 
allow the killing of a brahmana but where it is possible to ward 
him off by a mere blow ( i. e. without actually killing him ) 
there would be the sin of brahmana-murder if he were actually 
killed. The Sm. C. in a long note appears to hold that an atatayin 
brahmana rushing upon a man to kill him may be killed by the 
person attacked (there is no sin and no punishment nor penance 
for it ), that a brahmana atatayin ( who does not come to kill 
but ) who only siezes one's fields or wife should not be killed 
( but lesser harm may be done to him with impunity ) and that 
ksatriyas and others if atatayin may be killed outright. The 
Vyavahara-Mayukha 245 adds a rider that, on account of the 
prescription contained in the section on kalivarjya ( actions 
forbidden in the Kali age ) viz. ' the killing in a properly 
conducted fight of brahmanas that are atatayin ' ( is forbidden 
in Kali), an atatayin brahmana even when about to kill a person 
should not be killed by that person in the Kali age, that such a 
brahmana was allowed to be killed in former ages, that an 
atatayin brahmana other than one bent upon killing another 
was not be killed in all ages. The Vlramitrodaya ( pp. 19-27 ) 
has a long disquisition on this subject but space forbids us 
from giving even a brief summary of it. It will have been 
noticed how the sacredness of the brahrnana's person went on 
increasing in later ages. 

(10) Even threatening a brahmana with assault, or 
striking him or drawing blood from his body drew the severest 
condemnation from very ancient times. The Tai. 248 S. ( II. 6. 
10. 1-2 ) contains these words * He who threatens a brahmana 
should be fined a hundred, he who strikes a brahmana should be 
fined a thousand, he who draws blood would not reach ( or find ) 
the abode of pitrs for as many years as the dust particles that 
may be made into a paste by the quantity of blood drawn. 
Therefore one should not threaten a brahmana with assault, nor 
strike him nor draw his blood'. Gaut. (22. 20-22) has a

similar 847 dictum, viz. that threatening a brahmana with assault 
in wrath prevents entry into heaven for a hundred years ( or 
leads to hell for a hundred years ) &c. Jaimini III. 4. 17 
considers the question whether the passage in the Tai. S. is 
kvatvartha or purusartha. 

(11) For certain offences a brahmana received lesser 
punishment than members of other classes. For example, Gaut. 
says 848 'if a ksatriya reviled a brahmana the fine was one 
hundred ( karsapanas ), if a vaisya did so it was 150 ; but if a 
brahmana reviled a ksatriya the fine was 50; if he reviled a vai&ya 
it was only 25, and if a brahmana reviled a sudra he was not 
to be fined.' Vide Manu VIII. 267-268 ( but Manu prescribes a 
fine of twelve for a brahmana reviling a 6udra ) which are the 
same as Narada ( vakparusya verses 15-16 ), Yaj. II. 206-207. 
But in the case of certain crimes the brahmana was to receive 
heavier punishment. For example, in the case of theft, if a 
6udra thief was fined m eight, a vaisya 16 and a ksatriya 32, a 
brahmana was fined 64, 100 or 128. Vide Gaut. 21. 12-14 and 
Manu Vin. 337-338. 

(12) According to Gaut. 350 ( XIII. 4 ) a brahmana could 
not be cited as a witness by a litigant who was not a brahmana 
and the king would not summon him, provided he ( the 
brahmana) was not an attesting witness on a document. 
Narada ( rnadana verse 158 ) lays down that 251 ' 6rotriyas, those 
engaged in austerities, old men, those who have become 
ascetics, are not to be witnesses because the authoritative texts 
so prescribe but there is no cause assigned for this rule. ' So 
Narada's view was that a sirotriya could never be cited as a 
witness by any litigant ( even by a brahmana litigant ). Gaut. 
impliedly shows that even a 6rotriya could be cited as a wit- 
ness by a brahmana. Manu VIII, 65, Visnu Dh. S. VIII. 2 also 
forbid citing a fcrotriya as a witness.

Ch. Ill ] Minor privileges of brahmanas 153 

(13) Only certain brahmanas were to be invited for 
dinner in fcraddhas and in rites for gods. Vide Gaut. 15. 5 and 
9,Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 4, Manu III. 124 and 128, Yaj. I. 
217, 219, 221. 

(14) Certain sacrifices could be performed only by 
brahmanas. For example, the Sautramanl sacrifice and the 
sacrifices called sattras could be performed only by brahmanas. 588 
But it has to be noted that the Rajasuya sacrifice could 
performed only by ksatriyas and that according to Jairnini 
VI. 6. 24-26 even brahmanas of Bhrgu, Sunaka and Vasistha 
gotras could not perform a sattra. 

(15) The periods of mourning were less in the case of 
brahmanas. Gaufc. 14. 1-4 prescribes ten days of mourning 
for brahmanas, eleven for ksatriyas, twelve for vaisyas and a 
month for sudras. Vas. Dh. S. IV. 27-30, Visnu Dh. S. 22. 1-4, 
Manu V. 83, Yaj. III. 22 contain similar provisions. Later 
on ten days' mourning came to be prescribed for all castes. 353 

Several other lesser privileges are enumerated by Narada 
(praklrnaka, verses 35-39) 'The king shall show his face 
in the morning before brahmanas first of all and shall 
salute them all. When nine or seven persons ( of different 
rank ) meet, they shall first make room for the brahmana 
to pass 354 by. Further privileges assigned to brahmanas 
are : free access to the houses of other people for the purpose of 
begging alms ; the right to collect fuel, flowers, water and the 
like without its being regarded as a theft 355 and to converse 
with other men's wives without being restrained ( in such 
conversation ) by others ; and the right to cross rivers without 
paying any fare for the ferry-boat and to be oonveyed ( to the 
other bank) before other people. When engaged in trading 
and using a ferry boat, they shall have to pay no toll. A

nothing to eat, commits no wrong by taking two canes of 
sugar or two esculent roots. 

There were some disabilities also in the case of brahmanas 
which have been indicated in the above discussion ( viz. as 
to avocations, selling articles &c. ). 

It may be convenient to bring together the disabilities of 
the siidra : 

(1) He was not allowed to study the Veda. Many of 
the smrfcikaras and writers of digests 256 quote several Vedio 
passages on this point. A sruti text reads ' ( The Creator ) 
created the brahmana with Gayatrl ( metre ), the rajanya with 
Tristubh, the vaisya with JagatI, but he did not create the 
siidra with any metre; therefore the siidra is known to be 
unfit for the samskara ( of upanayana ) \ The study of the 
Veda follows after Upanayana and the Veda speaks of the 
Upanayana of only three classes 857 * one should perform 
upanayana for a brahmana in spring, for a rajanya in summer 
and in sarad ( autumn ) for a vaisya. 9 Not only was the siidra 
not to study the Veda, but Veda study was not to be carried 
on in his presence ( vide note 75 above ). 858 This attitude 
need not cause wonder. The sacred Vedic literature was largely 
created and preserved entirely by the brahmanas ( the ksatriyas 
contributing if at all a very small share in that task ). If the 
brahmanas desired to keep their sacred treasure for the twice- 
born classes in these circumstances, it is understandable and for 
those ages even excusable. In the 20th century there are vast 
majorities who are not allowed by small minorities of imperial- 
istic and capitalistic tendencies to control the just and equitable 
distribution of the material goods produced mostly by the 
labour and co-operation of those majorities and doctrines are 
being openly professed that certain races alone should be 
imparted higher and scientific knowledge while other so-called 
inferior races should be only hewers of wood and drawers 
of water.

Ch. Ill ] &udra not allowed to study Veda 455 

There are however faint traces thai; in ancient times this 
prohibition of Veda study was not so absolute and universal as 
the smrtis make it. In the Chandogya Upanisad IV. 1-2, we 
have the story of JanaSruti Pautrayana and Raikva where the 
latter addresses Janasruti as sudra and imparts to him the 
Samvarga ( absorption ) vidya** 9 It appears that Janasruti was 
a 6udra to whom the vidya embodied in the Chandogya ( which 
is also Veda ) was imparted. It is no doubt true that in the 
Vedantasutra 860 ( I. 3. 34 ) the word 6udra is explained not as 
referring to the class, but as meaning that sorrow ( kuc ) arose in 
Janasruti on hearing the contemptuous talk of the flamingoes 
about himself and he was overcome ( from dru ) by that ( i. e. 
sudra is derived from sue and dru ). But this far-fetched 
explanation had to be given because of the practice current in 
the times of the Vedanfcasiitras that the 6udra is not entitled to 
study the Veda. Gaut. XII. 4 went so far as to prescribe * if the 
sudra intentionally listens for committing to memory the Veda, 
then his ears should be filled with ( molten ) lead and lac ; if he 
utters the Veda, then his tongue may be cut off ; if he has 
mastered the Veda his body should be hacked ' S61 . 

Though the sudra could not study the Veda, he was not 
debarred from hearing the itihasas ( like the Mahabharata ) and 
the Puranas. The 862 Mahabharata ( Santi 328. 49 ) expressly says 
that the four varnas should hear the Mahabharata through a 
brahmana as reader. The Bhagavatapurana 262 says that as the 
three Vedas cannot be learnt by women, sudras and brahmanas 
( who are so only by birth ), the sage ( Vyasa ) composed the 
story of the Bharafca out of compassion for them. The Sudraka- 
malakara m ( pp. 13-14 ) cites several passages from the puranas

to the effect that the sudra could not study the smrtis and pur&nas 
by himself. Even Manu II. 16 seems to suggest that only the 
dvijatis had the privilege to listen to the Manusmrti ( and not 
sudras ). The only privilege conceded by the Sudrakamalakara 
to the sudra is that he can acquire knowledge by listening to 
the puranas read by a brahmana (p. 17) ; the Kalpataru and other 
works allowed the sudra to read and repeat Purana mantras. 
Samkaracarya on Vedantasutra ( I. 3. 38 ) quotes Santi 328. 49 
and says that the sudra has no adhikara ( eligibility ) for bra- 
hmavidya based upon a study of the Veda, but that a sudra can 
attain spiritual development ( just as Vidura and Dharma- 
vyadha mentioned in the Mahabharata did ) and that he may 
attain to moksa, the fruit of correct knowledge. In certain digests 
we find a smrti quotation to the effect that sudras are Vajasa- 
neyins. This is 865 explained as meaning that the sudra should 
follow the procedure prescribed in the grhyasutra of the Vajasa- 
neya Sakha and a brahmana should repeat the mantra for him- 
This h probably based on the Harivamsa ( Bhavisyat-parva, 
chap. III. 13 ) "all will expound brahma ; all will be Vajasane- 
yins ; when the yuga comes to a close sudras will make use of

(2) The sudras were not to consecrate sacred fires and to 
perform the solemn Vedic sacrifices. Vide note 73 above. Jaimini 
( I. 3. 25-38 ) elaborately discusses this question and arrives at 
the conclusion that the sudra cannot consecrate the three sacred 
fires and so cannot perform Vedic rites. Among the reasons 
given are that in several Vedic passages only the three higher 
classes are referred to in the case of the consecration of fires, 
about the samans to be sung, about the food to be taken when 
observing vrata. 266 It is however interesting to note that at least 
one ancient teacher ( Badari ) S67 was found who advocated that

even sudras could perform Vedic sacrifices. The : Bharadvaja 
Srauta sutra 368 (V.2.8) states the opinion of some that; the sudra 
can consecrate the three sacred Vedic fires. The Katyayana- 
srautasutra ( I. 4. 5 ) prescribes that all can perform Vedic rites 
except those who are deficient in a limb, who are not learned in 
the 369 Veda, who are impotent and sudras; but the commentary 
thereon states by way of purvapaksa that there are certain 
Vedic texts which lead to the inference that the Sudra had the 
adhikara for Vedic rites e. g. in Sat. Br. I. 1. 4. 12 ( S. B. E. vol. 
XII. p. 28 ) it is said with reference to the Haviskrt call "Now 
there are four different forms of this call, viz. 'Come hither* 
( ehi ) in the case of a brahmana ; ' approach * ( agahi ) and 
4 hasten hither ' (adrava) in the case of a vaisya and a member 
of the military caste and ' run hither * ( adhava ) in that of a 
sudra." Similarly in the Sornayaga in place of the payovrata 
( vow to drink milk only ) mastu ( whey ) is prescribed for sudra 
( indicating thereby that the sudra could perform Somayaga) 
and in Sat. Br. (XIII 8. 3. 11, S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 435 ) with 
reference to sepulchral mounds it is said 4 for the ksatriya he may 
make as high as a man with upsfcretched arms, for a brShmana 
reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, for a 
vaisya up to the thighs, for a sudra up to the knee \ The 
commentary on the Katyayana Srauta I. 1. 6 says that the word 
sudra here stands for rathakara because ( ace. to Yaj, I. 91 ) his 
mother's mother is a sudra woman. 

Though the sudra was not authorized to perform Vedic 
rites, he was entitled to perform what is called pur(a-dharma m 
i. e. the building of wells, tanks, temples, parks and distribution 
of food as works of charity and gifts on such occasions 
as eclipses and the Sun's passage from one zodiacal sign 
into another and on the 12th and other tithis. He was 
allowed to perform the five daily sacrifices called Mahayajnas

in the ordinary fire, he could perform Sraddha, he was to think 
of the devatas and utter loudly the word ' namah * which was 
to be the only mantra in his case ( i. e. he was not to say 
* Agnaye svaha ' but to think of Agni and say 871 * namah' )â¢ 
Manu X. 127 prescribes that all religious rites for the sudra 
are without (Vedic) mantras. According to some the 6udra 
could also have what is called Vaivahika fire ( i. e. fire kindled 
at the time of marriage ) in Manu III 67 and Yaj. I. 97, but 
Medhatithi (on the same verse), the Mit. ( on Yaj. I. 121 ), the 
Madanaparijata ( p. 231 ) and other works say that he should 
offer oblations in the ordinary firo and that there is no Vaivahika 
fire for the sudra. All persons including the Sudras and even 
candalas were authorized to repeat the Ramamantra of 13 letters 
( Sri Rama jaya Rama jaya jaya Rama ) and the Siva mantra 
of five letters ( namah Sivaya ), while dvijatis could repeat 
the Siva mantra of six letters (Ora namah Sivaya). Vide 
Sudra- kamalakara pp. 30-31, where passages of Varaha, Vamana 
and Bhavisya Puranas are cited to show that siidras are entitled 
to learn and repeat mantras of Visnu from the Paficaratra texts 
and of Siva, the Sun, Sakti and Vinayaka. The Varahapurana 
( 128. 22-31 ) describes the initiation ( dlksa) of a 6iidra as a 
devotee of Visnu ( as a bhagavata ). 

(3) As to Samskaras, there is some apparent conflict 
among the authorities. Manu X. 126 says * The sudra incurs 
no sin ( by eating forbidden articles like onions and garlic ), 
he is not fit for samskaras, he has no adhikara for ( authority to 
perform ) dharma nor is he forbidden from performing dharma ' 
and in IV. 80 ( which is the same as Vas. Dh. S. 18. 14 and Visnu 
Dh. S. 71. 48-52) we see * one should not give advice to a sudra, 
nor give him leavings of food nor of sacrificial oblations, one

should not impart religious instruction to him nor ask him to 
perform vratas \ Laghuvisnu m ( 1. 15 ) contains the dictum that 
the 6udra is devoid of any samskara. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 
explains the words of Manu IV. 80 about vratas in the case of 
fcudras as applicable only to those sudras who are not in 
attendance upon members of the three higher oastes and esta- 
blishes that sudras can perform vratas ( but without homa and 
muttering of mantras ). Apararka on the same verse ( Manu IV. 
80 ) explains that the sudra cannot perform vratas in person, 
but only through the medium of a br&hmana. The Sudra- 
kamalakara ( p. 38 ) holds that sudras are entitled to perform 
vratas, fasts, mahadanas and praya^citfcas, but without homa 
and japa. Manu X. 127 allows religious sudras to perform all 
religious acts which dvijatis perform, provided they do not use 
Vedio mantras. On the other hand Sankha (as quoted by 
Vtevarupa on Yaj. I. 13 ) opines that saihsk&ras may be 
performed for sudras but without Vedic mantras. Yama quoted 
in Sm. C. ( L p. 14 ) says the same. Veda-VySsa (I. 17 ) 
prescribes that ten samskaras ( viz. garbhadhana, pumsavana, 
slmantonnayana, jatakarma, namakarana, niskramana, anna- 
prasana, caula, karnavedha and vivaha ) can be performed in 
the case of sudras, but without Vedic mantras. Haradatta ( on 
Gautama X. 51 ) quotes a grhyakara to the effect that even in 
the case of the sudra the rites of niseka, pumsavana, slmanton- 
nayana, jatakarma, namakarana, annaprasana and caula are 
allowed but without Vedic mantras. When Manu prescribes 
( II. 32 ) that the sudra should be given a name connected with 
service, he indicates that the sudra could perform the ceremony 
of namakarana. So when Manu ( IV. 80 ) states that he deserves 
no.samskara, what he means is that no samskara with Vedic 
mantras was to be performed in his case. Medhatithi on Manu 
IV. 80 says that the prohibition to give advice and impart 
instruction in dharma applies only when these are done for 
making one's livelihood, but if a sudra is a friend of the 
family of a brahmana friendly advice or instruction can be 
given. Vide Sudrakamalakara p. 47 for several views about 
the samskaras allowed to sudras. 

(4) Liability to higher punishment for certain offences. 
If a 6udra committed adultery with a woman of the three

higher castes, Gaut. m ( XII. 1-2 ) prescribed the cutting off of 
his penis and forefeiture of all his property and if he was 
guilty of this offence when entrusted with the duty of pro- 
tecting her, he was to suffer death in addition. Vas. Dh. S. 21. li 
Manu VIII. 366 prescribe death in the case of a sudra having 
intercourse with a br&hmana woman whether she was willing 
or unwilling, On the other hand, if a brahmana committed 
rape on a brahmana woman he was fined a thousand and five 
hundred if he was guilty of adultery with her (Manu VIII. 378) 
and if a br&hmana had intercourse with a ksatriya, vaisya or 
sudra woman, who was not guarded, he was fined five hundred 
( Manu VIII. 385 ). Similarly in the case of Vdkparusya 
( slander and libel ) if a sudra reviled a brahmana he received 
corporal punishment or his tongue was cut off ( Manu VIII. 
270 ), but if a ksatriya or vaisya did so they were respectively 
fined 100 or 150 (Manu VIII. 267 ) and if a brahmana reviled 
a siidra, the brahmana was fined only 12 ( Manu VIII. 268 ) 
or nothing ( ace. to Gaut. XII. 10 ). In the case of theft, how- 
ever, the siidra was fined much less. Vide above p. 152 ( No. 11 
among the privileges of brahmanas). 

(5) In the matter of the period for impurity on death or 
birth the sudra was held to be impure for a month, while a 
brahmana had to observe ten days' period only. Vide above 
p. 153 (No. 15 among the privileges of brahmanas ). 

(6) A siidra could not be a judge or propound what 
dharma was. Manu ( VIII. 9 ) and Yaj. I. 3 lay down that 
when the king does not himself look into the litigation of 
people owing to pressure of other business, he should appoint a 
learned brahmana as a judge. Manu ( VIII. 20 ) further says 
that a king may appoint as his judge even a brahmana who is 
so by birth only ( i. e. who does not perform the peculiar 
duties of brahmanas ), but never a sudra. Katyayana ( as quoted

In parts of America the penalty for an attempt to commit a rape

akin. As to Rome vide Westermarck's 4 The Origin and Development 
of moral Ideas ' ( 1912) vol. I. p. 433 "from the beginning of Empire 
the citizens were divided into privileged classes and commonalty- 
ulerque ordo and plebB â and whilst a commoner who was guilty of 
murder was punished with death, a murderer belonging to the 
privileged classes was generally punished with deportation only. " 



Ch. Ill J Disabilities of Sudras i61 

in m the Mit. on Yaj. I. 3 ) says that when a brahmana is not 
available ( as a judge ) the king may appoint as judge a 
ksatriya or a vaisya who is proficient in dharmasastra, but he 
should carefully avoid appointing a sudra as judge, 

(7) A brahmana was not allowed to receive gifts from a 
sudra except under great restrictions. Vide above note 239. 

(8) A brahmana could take 875 food at the houses of mem- 
bers of the three classes who performed the duties prescribed for 
them by the sastras ( according to Gaut. ), but he could not take 
food from a sudra except when the sudra was his own cowherd, oi 
tilled his field or was a hereditary friend of the family, or his 
own barber or his dasa. Vide Gaut. XVII. 6 and Manu IV. 253 
( = Visnu Dh. S. 57. 16 ), Yaj. I. 166, Parasara IX. 19. Ap. Dh. 
S. I. 5. 16. 22 says S76 ( that food which is brought by an impure 
sudra should not be eaten by a brahmana;' but Apastamba allows 
sudras to be cooks in brahmana households provided they were 
supervised by a member of the three higher classes and observed 
certain hygienic rules about paring nails, the cutting of hair. 
Manu IV. 211 forbade in general the food of a .sudra to a 
brahmana and by IV. 223 he laid down that a learned brahmana 
should not take cooked food from a sudra who did not perform 
sraddba and other daily rites ( mahayajfias ) but that he may 
take from such a sudra uncooked grain for one night, if he 
oannot get food from anywhere else. Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 1 ) 
requires a brahmana to avoid the food of vrsalas ( sudras ). 
Gradually rules about taking food fro-u sudras became stricter. 
The Sankhasmrti ( 13. 4 ) remarks that brahmanas fattened on 
the food given by sudras are Panklidusaka. Parasara 577 XI. 13 
ordains that a brahmana may take from a sudra ghee, oil, milk, 
molasses and food fried in oil or ghee, but should eat it on a 
river bank and not in the sudra's house and the Par. M. adds

( II. 1. pp. 411-12 ) that this permission is meant to apply only 
when the brahmana is tired by travelling and no food from a 
member of another class is available. Haradatta on Gaut. 
XVII. 6 remarks that a brahmana could take food from a 6udra 
who was a cowherd &c. only in the case of very extreme cala- 
mities. Apararka also (p. 244 on Yaj. I. 168) says the same. 
In the kalivaTJya ( actions forbidden in the kali age ) the old 
practice of eating the food of cowherds, barber &c. was for- 
bidden. 878 

(9) The sudra gradually came to be so much looked 
down upon that he could not touch a brahmana, though at one 
time he could bo a cook in a brahmana household and a brah- 
mana could eat food from his house. In the Anusasanaparva 
( 59.33 ) it is said S79 * a brahmana should be served by a 
siidra from a distance like blazing firei while he may be 
waited upon by a ksatriya or vaisya after touching him.* 
Apararka ( p. 1196 ) quotes two smrti texts ' a brahmana on 
touching a sudra or nisada becomes pure by acaraana ( ceremo- 
nial sipping of water ) ; on touching persons lower than these, 
he becomes pure by bathing, pranayama and the strength of 
tapas; on seeing a ram, a cock, a crow, a dog, a sudra and an 
antyavasayin ( an antyaja ), one should stop the rite that is 
being performed and on touching them one should take a bath \ 
On this ApaTarka explains that if a man who touched a 6udra 
cannot bathe then he may resort to sipping water, but if able he 
must take a bath or that on touching a sat-6udra one may have 
recourse to acamana and on touching an asaWudra one must take 
a bath. We find from the Grhyasutras 380 that in Madhuparka 
offered to a snataka the feet of the guest ( even if he was a 
brahmana ) were washed by a sudra male or female. So there 
could have been no ban against a sudra touching a brahmana 
then. The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 3. 6. 9-10) says that two 6udras should 
wash the feet of a guest, according to some teachers ( in the 
case of a householder who has several dasas ), while ApaBtamba

himself says that one' Sudra should wash the guest's feet and 
another should sprinkle him with water, 281 

(10) As the Sudra could not be initiated into Vedio 
study, the only aSrama out of the four that he was entftled to 
was that of the householder. In the Anusasanaparva ( 165. 10 ) 
we read 888 ' I am a Sudra and so I have no right to resort to the 
four asramas \ In the Santiparva 383 ( 63. 12-14 ) it is said, ' in 
the case of a Sudra who performs service (of the higher classes ), 
who has done his duty, who has raised offspring, who has 
only a short span of life left or is reduced to the 10th stage 
( i. e. is above 90 years of age ), the fruits of all asramas are 
laid down ( as obtained by him ) except of the fourth.' Medha- 
tithi on Manu VI. 97 explains these words as meaning that the 
sudra by serving brahmanas and procreating offspring as a 
house-holder acquires the merit of all asramas except moksa 
which is the reward of the proper observance of the duties of 
the fourth asrama. 

(11) The life of a sudra was esteemed rather low. Yaj. 
III. 236 and Manu XL 66 include the killing of a woman, 
a sudra, a vaisya and a ksatriya among upapatakas ; but the 
prayaSoittas and gifts prescribed for killing these show that the 
life of the sudra was not worth much. On killing a ksatriya, the 
prSyaSoitta prescribed was brahmaoarya for six years, gift 
of 1000 cows and a bull; for killing a vaisya, brahmaoarya 
for three years and gift of 100 cows and a bull ; for killing 
a Sudra brahmacarya for one year, gift of 10 cows and a bull. 
Gaut. XXII. 14-16, Manu XI, 126-130, Yaj III. 266-267 say 
practically the same thing. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 25. 14-1. 9. 26. 1 ) 
says that on killing a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a cakravaka, 
flamingo, bhasa, a frog, ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog, a cow and 
draught ox the piayascitta is the same as that for killing a 
Sudra. Manu ( XL 131 ) says ' on killing a cat, an ichneumon,

oasa, a frog, a dog, iguana, owl and crow, the prSyasoitta is the 
same as that for killing a sudra. 884 

If the sudra laboured under certain grave disabilities, he 
had certain compensating advantages. He could follow almost 
any profession except the few specially reserved for brahmanas 
and ksatriyas. Even as to the latter many sudras became 
kings and Kaut, in his Arthasastra ( IX. 2 ) speaks of armies of 
sudras ( vide note 266 above). The sudra was free from the 
round of countless daily rites. He was compelled to undergo 
no saihskara (except marriage), he could indulge in any kind 
of food and drink wine, he had to undergo no penances for lapses 
from the rules of the sastras, he had to observe no restrictions of 
gotra and pravara in marriage. Those western writers who turn 
up their nose at the position of the sudras in ancient and 
medieval India conveniently forget what atrocious crimes 
were perpetrated by their people in the institution of slavery 
and in their dealings with the Bed Indians and other backward 
coloured races; how nations of Europe out of false pride of 
race have passed in the 20th oentury laws prohibiting marriages 
between the so-called Aryans and non-Aryans and preventing 
the latter from htlding state offices and carrying on several 
occupations and how discrimination is made against coloured 
men on railways, in hotels and other places of public resort 
and how even in India separate third class compartments were 
reserved on railways for Europeans, for entering which Indians 
were prosecuted and sentenced in their own country. Vide 
Emperor vs Narayan 25 Bom. L. R. 26 for such a case. 



384. Those who are familiar with the cases decided in India in which 
Indian servants or coolies were kicked by European employers and died 
as a result and in which the offenders were either acquitted or let off 
on a small fine (on the ground that the deceased had an enlarged spleen) 
need not feci surprised at the above statement of affairs in India over 
two thousand years ago. 



CHAPTER IV 

UNTOUCHABILITY 

Those who have written on the Indian caste system have 
always been struck by the fact of the existence of certain 
castes that are treated as untouchables. But it should not be 
supposed that this is something confined only to India. Even 
nations that have no caste system at all have often carried out 
complete segregation of certain people dwelling in their midst, 
which in essentials is the same as the system of untouchability 
in India, The Encyclopaedia of social sciences vol. XI. p. 339 
says that in the southern States of U. S, A. discrimination 
against Negroes took the form of 'residential segregation, 
separation of the races in public conveyances and places of 
amusement, exclusion of Negroes from public institutions and 
educational discrimination. Disenfranchisement and social 
discrimination had their economic counterpart in all branches 
of industry except agriculture and domestic and personal 
service, 385 occupations to which Negroes had been habituated 
under the slave regime. ' It is also within living memory that 
Mahatma Gandhi had to lead a movement of satyagraha in 
South Africa against the discriminating treatment of Indians 
and even now in Natal and other parts of British Africa there 
is legislation restricting Indians in the matter of residence 
and nurchases of land. 

In the early Vedic literature several of the names of castes 
that are spoken of in the smrtis as antyajas occur. We have 
carmamna ( a tanner of hides ? ) in the Rgveda ( VIII. 5. 38 ), 
the Cfindala and Paulkasa occur in the Vfij. S., the Vapa or 
VaptS ( barber ) even in the Rg., the Vidalakara or Bidalakara 
( corresponding to the buruda of the smrtis ) occurs in the 
Vaj. S. and the Tai. Br., VSsahpalpulI ( washerwoman ) correspond- 
ing to the Rajaka of the smrtis in the V5j. S. But there is nc

indication in these passages whether these, even if they formed 
castes, were at all untouchables. The utmost that can be said 
is that as the Paulkasa is assigned to bibhatsa ( in Vaj. S. 30. 17 ) 
and Candala to Vayu ( in the Purusamedha ), the Paulkasa lived 
in such a way as to cause disgust and the Candala lived in the 
wind ( i. e. probably in the open or in a cemetery ). The only 
passage of Vedic literature on which reliance can be placed for 
some definite statement about candalas is in the Chandogya 
Up. 388 V. 10. 7. where while describing the fate of those souls 
that went to the world of the moon for enjoying the rewards of 
some of their actions it is stated * those who did praiseworthy 
actions here, quickly acquire birth in a good condition, viz. in 
the condition of a brahmana, a ksatriya or vaisiya, while those 
whose actions were low ( reprehensible ) quickly acquire birth 
in a low condition i. e. as a dog, or a boar or a candala. ' 
This occurs in Pancagnividya, the purpose of which is to teach 
vairagya and disgust with the transmigratory world. This 
passage does not enjoin anything, it is a bare statement by way 
of explanation or elucidation. All that can be legitimately 
inferred from this is that the first three varnas were commended 
and that candalas were looked upon as the lowest in the social 
scale. It is to be noticed that the Sudra varna does not occur 
in this passage at all. So probably even in the times of the 
Chandogya the candala was looked upon as a sudra, though lowest 
among the several Sudra subcastes. The candala is equated 
with the dog and the boar in this passage, but this leads hardly 
anywhere. It is no doubt stated in the Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 4 m 
that 'three beasts are unclean in relation to a sacrifice viz. the 
vicious (filthy) boar, the ram and the dog. ' Here it is clear that 
every boar is not unclean, but probably only that variety that 
subsists on the village offal. On the other hand the flesh of 
boars was said to cause great delight to the Pitrs when offered 
in giraddha (vide Manu III. 270 and Yaj. I. 259 ). Therefore this 
Upanisad passage does not say anything on the point whether the 
Candala was in its day untouchable. This passage may be com- 
pared with another in which the dudra is said to be a walking

cemetery. If the Sudra was not untouchable in the Vedio 
literature, and if he was allowed to be a cook for brahmanas and 
to wash the feet of brShmana guests in spite of that passage ( as 
stated in the Dharmasutras quoted above pp. 161-162 ), there is 
no reason to suppose that the Ch&ndogya passage indicates that 
the candala was untouchable in the remote ages. Another 
passage is relied upon by orthodox writers to support the theory 
that untouchability of candalas is declared in Vedic writings. 
In the Br. Up. I. 3 the story is narrated that gods and asuras 
had a strife and the gods thought that they might rise superior 
to the asuras by the Udgltha. In this vidya occurs the passage 388 
4 this devata ( Prana ) throwing aside the sin that was death 
to these devatas ( vak etc. ) sent it to the ends of these quarters 
and he put down the sin of these devatas there ; therefore one 
should not go to people ( outside the Aryan pale ) nor to the 
ends ( of the quarters ) thinking ' otherwise I may fall in with 
papman i. e. death*. In the first place there are no peoples 
expressly named here. Samkara explains that by ' end of the 
quarters * are meant regions where people opposed to Vedio 
culture dwell. This description can only apply to people like 
the mlecchas and not to candalas who are not opposed to 
Vedio knowledge (but who have no adhikara to learn it). 
Besides candalas might stay outside the village* but they do 
not stay at the end of the quarters 389 ( or at the end of the arya 
territory ). Hence this passage does not help in establishing 
the theory of untouchability for Vedic times. 

Next comes the consideration of the evidence derived from 
the sutras and smrfcis. But certain preliminary observations 
must be made to clarify the position. The theory of the early 
smrfcis was that there were only four varnas and there was no 
fifth varna, Vide Manu X. 4 and Anu^asanaparva 47.18.* 90 
When in modern times the so-called untouchables are referred 



389. The Mlecchas were known to the Sat. Br. (III. 2. 1. 24

to as the pancamas}^ that is something against the smrti tradi- 
tion. Pan. II. 4. 10 and Patafijali 898 say that a Samahara- 
dvandva compound can be formed from several subdivisions of 
sudras that are not niravasita e. g. we can have the compound 
* taksayaskaram * meaning carpenters and blacksmiths, but not 
% mridala-rnrtapam\ because candalas and mrtapas are niravasita 
6udras ( and so the compound will be ' candalamrtapah). There- 
fore it follows that Pan. and Patanjali included candalas and 
mrtapas among Sudras. When Angiras ( note 171 above ) 
includes ksatr, suta, vaidehika, magadha and ayogava ( that are 
pratiloma castes) among antyavasayins along with candala 
and fcvapaca, he makes it clear that he regarded candalas as 
inoluded among sudras, for Manu X. 41 declares that all 
pratiloma castes are similar to sudras in their dharma and 
because the Santiparva 297.28 s93 expressly says that the 
vaidehika is called siudra by learned dvijas. Gradually how- 
ever, a distinction was made between Sudras and castes like 
candalas. Fresh castes were then added to the list of untoucha- 
bles by custom and usage and the spirit of exclusiveness, though 
there is no warrant of the Sastras for such a procedure. 

Untouchability did not and does not arise by birth alone. 
It arises in various ways. In the first place, persons become 
outcasted and untouchable by being guilty of certain acts that 
amount to grave sins. For example, Manu IX. 235-239 prescri- 
bes that those who are guilty of brahmana-murder, theft of 
brahmana'g gold or drinkers of spirituous liquors should be 
excommunicated, no one should dine with them or teaclithem, 
or officiate as priests for them, nor should marriage relationship 
be entered into with them and they should wander over the 
world excluded from all Vedic dharmas. But if they perform 
the proper prEyaÂ§citta they are restored to caste and become 
touchable. Secondly, persons were treated as untouchables 
simply through religious hatred and abhorrence because they 
belonged to a different sect or religion. For example, Apararka

( p. 923 ) and Sra. C. m ( I. p. 118 ) quote verses from the SaV 
trim6an-mata and Brahm&ndapurana that 'on touching Bauddhas, 
Pa6upatas, Jainas, Lokayatikas, Kapilas ( Sariikhyas ) and 
br&hmanas guilty of doing actions inconsistent with their oaste 
one should enter water with the clothes on and also on touching 
Saivas and atheists'. It is worthy of note that Apararka m p. 923 
quotes a verse of Vrddha-Ysjnavalkya that on touohing 
c&ndalas, pukkasas, mlecohas, Bhillas and Paraslkas and persons 
guilty of mahSpatakas one should bathe with the clothes on. 
Thirdly, certain persons, though not untouchable ordinarily, 
became so, if they followed certain occupations, e. g. if a person 
touches a brahmana who is devalaka ( i. e. has been doing wor- 
ship to an image for money for three years ) or who is a priest 
for the whole village, or a person who sells a soma plant, then 
he has to bathe with his clothes on. 398 Fourthly, persons become 
untouchable when in certain conditions e. g. a person if he 
touches even his wife in her monthly period or during the 
first ten days after delivery or if he touches a person during 
the period of mourning on the death of some relative or a 
person who has carried a corpse to the cemetery and has not 
yet bathed, he then has to take a bath with his clothes on ( vide 
Manu V. 85 ). Fifthly, certain races such as mlecchas and 
persons from certain countries and the countries themselves 
were regarded as impure ( vide notes 40, 42, 49 ). Further the 
smrtis say that persons following certain filthy, low and dis- 
approved avocations were untouchable e. g. Samvarta m quoted

170 History of Dharmainstra [ Ch. IV 

by Apararka p. 1196 says 'on touching a fisherman, a deer-hunter, 
a hunter, a butcher, a bird-catcher, and a washerman one must 
first bathe and then take one's meal'. It is to be remarked that such 
texts do not expressly make a man of those castes untouchable 
even if he does not pursue the occupation stated, but they have 
rather the occupation in view. Such occupations were thought 
impure, as it was believed that if one was to secure the final goal 
of liberation, one must cultivate purity of mind as well as body, 
and as great importance came to be attached to cleanliness 
and the ceremonial purity of the body for spiritual purposes ; 
and emphasis was laid upon not coming in contact with 
persons carrying on filthy or impure pursuits, but also with 
animals and even inanimate objects. These restrictions were 
not inspired by any hardness of heart or any racial or caste 
pride as % ; is often said, but they were due to psychological or 
religious views and the requirements of hygiene. Ap. Dh. S. 
I. 5. 15. 16 says ' a person touched by a dog should take a bath 
with his clothes on \ Vide also Vas. Dh. S. 23. 33, Visnu Dh. 
S. 22. 69. Vrddha-Harlfca ( chap. 11. 99-102) enumerates certain 
vegetables and herbs ( such as leek ) and other articles on 
touching which one was to bathe- Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 4. 9. 5 ) 
requires every house-holder to give food after Vaisvadeva to all 
including candalas, dogs and crows. And this practice is 
followed even now by those who perform Vaisvadeva. The 
ancient Hindus had a horror of uncleanliness and they desired 
to segregate those who followed unclean professions like those 
of sweepers, workers in hide, tanners, guardians of cemeteries 
&c. This segregation cannot be said to have been quite unjus- 
tifiable. Besides those who are not familiar with ancient or 
even modern Hindu notions must be warned against being 
carried away by the horror naturally felt at first sight when 
certain classes are treated as untouchable. The underlying 
notions of untouchability are religious and ceremonial purity 
and impurity. A man's nearest and dearest women relatives 
such as his own mother and wife or daughter are untouchable 
to him during their monthly periods. To him the most 
affectionate friend is untouchable for several days when the 
latter is in mourning due to death in the latfeer's family. A person 
cannot touch his own son (whose thread ceremony has been 
performed ) at the time of taking meals. In this latter case 
there is no idea of impurity and in most of these cases there is 
no idea of superiority or inferiority. As many professions and 
crafts were in ancient times hereditary, gradually the idea arope 



Oh. IV] tJntoUchability 111 

that a man who belonged to a caste pursuing certain filthy or 
abhorred avocations or crafts was by birth untouchable. Medie- 
val and modern usage had no doubt reached the stage that if a 
man belonged by birth to a caste deemed by custom to be untou- 
chable he remained an untouchable whatever profession or craft 
he may pursue or even if he pursued no profession. But ancient 
and medieval writers thought otherwise and there was also great 
divergence of view as to who were untouchables and to what ex- 
tent. The only caste that is said by the most ancient Dharma- 
sutras to be untouchable by birth is that of candalas and the word 
cSndala has a technical meaning in these works as stated above 
( p. 81 ) under candala. Gaufc. ( IV. 15 and 23 ) says that the can- 
dala is the offspring of a sudra from a brahmana woman and that 
he is the most reprehensible among the pratilomas. Ap. Dh. S. II. 
1. %. 8-9 898 states that on touching a candala one should plunge 
into water, on talking to him one should converse with a brah- 
mana ( for purification ), on seeing him one should look at the 
luminaries ( either the Sun or moon or stars ). We have seen 
above that there were three kinds of candalas and they were all 
so by virtue of the circumstances of their birth. Manu ( X. 36, 
51 ) makes only the andhra, meda, candala and sivapaca stay 
outside the village and makes the antyavasayin ( X 39 ) stay 
in a cemetery. That leads to the inference that other men even 
of the lowest castes could stay in the village itself. Harlta 399 
quoted by A par ark a ( p. 279 ) states 4 if a dvijati's limb other 
than the head is touched by a dyer, a shoemaker, a hunter, a 
fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a dancer ( nata ), a man 
of actor caste, oilman, vintner, hangman, village cock or 
dog, he becomes pure by washing that particular limb and by 
sipping water ( i. e. he need not bathe )'. Here most of the 
seven antyajas are included and it is expressly said that 
their touch is not so impure as to require a bath. Angiras 
( verse 17 ) states that a dvija when he comes in contact 
with a washerman, a shoemaker, a dancer ( na^a ), a fisher- 
man or a worker in bamboo becomes pure by merely acamana (by

sipping water ). The Nityacarapaddhati ( p. 130 ) quotes a 
verse 400 to the effect that even on ooming in contact with 
candalas and pukkasas one need not bathe, if the latter stand 
near a temple of Visnu and have come for the worship of 
Visnu. Alberuni in his work on India ( tr. by Sachau vol. !â¢ 
ohap. IX ) refers to two classes of antyajas, the first of whioh 
had eight guilds ( seven of which were practically the same as 
the seven in note 170 above, the eighth being the weaver ) and a 
second group of four viz. Hadi, Doma, Chandala and Bhadatau. 
As to the first group he says that they intermarried except the 
fuller, shoemaker and weaver. Alberuni seems to have been 
misinformed as to this and what caste he means by Bhadatau 
is not clear. Medhatithi 401 in his commentary on Manu X. 13 
is positive that the only pratiloma who is untouchable is the 
c&ndala and no bath is necessary on coming in contact with the 
other pratilomas ( viz. suta, magadha, ayogava, vaidehika and 
ksatr ). Kulluka also says the same. Therefore it follows that 
in spite of the smrti texts ( notes 170, 171, 173 ) including the pra- 
tilomas among antyajas along with the candalas, such authorita- 
tive and comparatively early commentators as Medhatithi (about 
900 A. D.) were firmly of opinion that they were not untouchable. 
Manu 408 V. 85 and Angiras 152 prescribe a bath for ooming in 
bodily contact with a divaklrti (a candala ), udakyS ( a woman 
in her monthly period ), patita ( one outcasted for sin &o. ), 
sutika ( a woman after delivery ), a corpse, one who has touched 
a corpse. It follows therefore that the only antyaja who was 
asprsya according to Manu was the candala. But gradually the 
spirit of exclusiveness and ideas of ritual purity were carried to 
extremes and more and more castes became untouchable. Some 
very orthodox writers of smrtis went so far as to hold that on 
touching even a 6udra a dvijati had to bathe. 403 Among the

earliest; occurrences of the word asprsya ( as meaning untouch- 
ables in general ) is that in Visnu Dh. S. V. 104 ; Kfityfiyana 
also uses the word in that sense 404 . It will have been seen from 
the quotations above that candalas, mlecchas and Paraslkas are 
placed on the same level as regards being asprsya. Atri 40 * 
( 267-269 ) says * if a dvija comes in contact with a candala, 
patita, mleocha, a vessel containing intoxicating drink, a woman 
in her monthly course, he should not take his meals ( without first 
bathing ) and if he comes in contact with these while taking his 
meal, he should stop, throw away the food and bathe \ Vide 
Visnu Dh. S. 22. 76 about talking with mlecchas and candalas. 
But so far as mlecchas are concerned these restrictions of 
untouchability have been given up long ago at least in public 
Similarly the washerman, the worker in bamboo, the fisherman, 
the nata, among the seven well-known aviyajas^ are no longer 
untouchable in several provinces (though not in all ) and were 
not so even in the times of Medhatithi and Kulluka. 

Once the spirit of exclusiveness and exaggerated notions of 
ceremonial purity got the upper hand they were carried to 
extremes. It does not appear from the ancient smrtis that the 
shadow of even the candala was deemed to be polluting. Manu 
V. 133 ( which is nearly the same as Visnu Dh. S. 23. 52 ) 
declares ' flies, spray from a reservoir, the shadow ( of a man ), 
the cow, the horse, the sun's rays, dust, the earth, the wind and 
fire should be regarded as pure. ' Yaj. I. 193 is a similar verse 
(Mark. Purana 35.21 is almost the same). Manu IV. 130 
prescribes that one should not knowingly cross the shadow of 
the image of a deity, of one's guru, of the king, of a snataka, of 
one's teacher, of a brown cow or of a man who has been initiated 
for a Vedic sacrifice. Here no reference is made to the shadow of 
a candala. Medhatithi on Manu V. 133 expressly says that 
4 shadow * means ' shadow of a candala and the like '. Kulluka, 
however, adds on Manu IV. 130 that on account of the word 
4 ca ' in that verse the shadow of candalas was included in the 
injunction of that verse. Therefore it is legitimate to infer 
that Manu and Yaj. did not prescribe that even the shadow of

a candala was impure and caused pollution. Not only bo, 
Aparftrka 40c quotes a verse ' the shadow of a candala or patita, 
if it falls on a man, is not impure \ But Apararka himself 407 
adds on this verse the comment that this favourable rule about 
the shadow of a candala or patita is applicable only if he is at 
a greater distance from a man than the length of a cow's tail. 
Bana in his Kadambarl ( para 8 ) describes how the candala 
girl entered the royal assembly-hall though she was untoucha- 
ble and stood at some distance from the king. It appears that 
there was no difficulty about her entering the hall of audience 
or polluting the assembly by her shadow. Gradually some 
smrtis prescribed a bath for a brahmana coming under the 
shadow of a candala. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 30 quotes a verse 
of Vyaghrapada that if a candala or patita comes nearer to a 
person than the length of a cow's tail, then the latter must 
take a bath and another verse of Brhaspati to the effect 
* a patita, a woman in her monthly period, a woman freshly 
delivered and a candala should be kept respectively at a distance 
of one yuga, two, three and four'. As yuga is four cubits, 
this means that a candala cannot approach within 16 cubits of 
a caste Hindu. 408 

As regards public roads Yaj. I. 194 says that they become 
pure by the rays of the sun and the moon and by the wind even 
when they are trodden by candalas. In Yaj. I. 197 it is stated 
that the mud and water on public roads and on houses built of 
baked bricks, though touched by candalas, dogs and crows, are 
rendered pure by the mere blowing of the wind over them. 409

These rules show that the srartis followed a reasonable rule 
about the public roads and do not countenance the restrictions 
maintained in some parts of South India, particularly in 
Malabar, about the use of publio roads by the untouchables 
viz. that an untouchable must not approach within a certain 
distanoe of a high caste Hindu, must leave the road to allow 
him passage or must shout to give warning of his presence in 
order to avoid pollution to the ens lie Hindu. Vide Wilson's 
4 Indian Castes ' vol. II p. 74 ( footnote ) for details of the distance. 
In South India also there are various grades of distances within 
which members of the several lowest castes cannot approach 
high caste Hindus. 

Certain provisions were made in the smrtis by way of 
exceptions to the general rules about the untouchability of 
certain castes. Atri 41 Â° ( verse 249 ) says ' there is no taint of 
untouchability when a person is touched by an untouchable in 
a temple, religious processions and marriages, in sacrifices, and 
in all festivals \ Satatapa quoted in the Sm. C. declares that 
there is no dosa ( lapse ) in touching ( untouchables ) in a village 
( i. e. on the publio road ), or in a religious procession or in an 
affray and the like, and also when the whole village is involved 
in a calamity. 411 Brhaspati also remarks that there is no fault 
( and so no prayasoitta ) if one comes in contact ( with untouch- 
ables ) at a sacred place, in marriage processions and religious 
processions, in battle, when the country is invaded, or when the 
town or village is on fire. The Sm. C. adds that these verses 
were variously interpreted; some saying that they apply only 
where one does not know that the man who has touched him is 
an untouchable, while others hold that they apply to the touch of

( p. 79 ) summarises the places where no blame in inourred on 
the ground of mixing with untouchables viz. in battle, on 
public roads leading to a market, in religious processions, in 
temples, in festivals, in sacrifices, at sacred places, in calamities 
or invasions of the country or village, on the banks of large 
sheets of water, in the presence of groat persons, when there 
is a sudden fire or other great calamity. It is somewhat 
remarkable that the Smrfcyarthasara speaks of untouchables 
entering temples. The Par. M. ( vol. II part I p. 115 ) says that 
there is no dosa when candalas take water from a large tank 
( used by higher castes ), but as regards small reservoirs the 
same rules apply to them that apply to the purification of wells 
touched by untouchables. 4l3 Vide Vrddha-Harlta IX 405-406 
for the purification of a well. 

The Visnu Dh. S. ( V. 104 ) 4U prescribed that if an untou- 
chable deliberately touched a man of the three higher castes he 
should be punished with beating, while Yaj. II. 234 prescribes 
that if a candala ( deliberately ) touches any one of the higher 
castes the candala should be fined one hundred panas. 

Elaborate rules are laid down about the penance for drink- 
ing from the wells or vessels of untouchables, for partaking of 
their food ( either cooked or uncooked ), for staying with them 
and for having sexual intercourse with untouchable women. 
These matters will be briefly dealt with under prSyascitta, 

The so-called untouchables were not entirely excluded from 
worship. When it is said ( as in Yaj. I. 93 or Gaut. IV. 20 ) 415 
that the candala is outside all dharma, the meaning is that he is 
outside su chVedic rites as upanayana, not that he cannot worship 
the Hindu deities nor that he is not bound by the moral code. 
He could worship images of the avataras of Visnu ( vide note 364 
above ), The Nirnayasindhu quotes a passage of the DevIpurSna 
that expressly authorizes antyajas to establish a temple of 
Bhairava. The BbagavatapurSna 418 X. 70. 43 says that c even the

antyavasSyins are purified by listening to the praises or names 
of Hari, by repeating the names of Hari and by contemplation 
on Him, much more therefore will those ( be purified ) who can 
see or touch your images'. This however shows that to the 
author of the Bhagavata it never occurred that an untouchable 
could see or touch the image of Visnu enshrined in a temple of 
caste Hindus. In south India among the famous Vaisnava saints 
called Slvars, TiruppSna Alvar was a member of the depressed 
classes and Nammalvar was a Vellala. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 
remarks that the pratiloma castes (which include candala) have 
the right to perform vrafcas. 417 

In modern times the eradication of the system of untoucha- 
bility is engaging the minds of great leaders like Mahatma 
Gandhi whose fast for 21 days for effecting a change of heart 
among caste Hindus is famous throughout the world. The princi- 
pal matters of concern to the so-called untouchables or depressed 
classes are facility for education in schools, removal of 
restrictions about places of public resort such as public wells, 
roads, restaurants and eating houses and entry in public 
temples. A good deal has been done by a few zealous workers 
from among the higher castes in these respects. The 
Christian missionaries have been doing good work among the 
untouchables, but their efforts are mainly devoted to direct or 
indirect proselytization. The conscience of the educated among 
the higher castes has been roused. But the total removal of un- 
touohability is yet a matter of the distant future. The greatest 
draw-back is illiteracy among the masses of India. Hardly 
twelve per cent of the population are literate. The diffusion 
of literacy and the spread of the idea of the equality of all 
men before the law and in public are the only sure solvents 
of the evils associated with untouchability which have exis- 
ted for ages. Popular Governments in the provinces are doing 
what they with their limited resources can do to ameliorate 
the condition of the untouchables. The Government of India 
Act ( of 1935 ) has given special representation to the 
Scheduled Castes (the name given to the depressed classes 
or untouchables ) in the Provincial and Federal Legislatures of 
India. The Government of India Scheduled Castes Order of 1936

sets out the names of the numerous scheduled castes in the 
several provinces of British India. The Provincial Govern- 
ments have issued circulars to enforce the rule that no 
discrimination be made against the scheduled castes in places 
of public resort and have tackled to some extent the question of 
the entry of untouchables in temples by passing such acts as the 
Bombay Act XI of 1938 viz. Bombay Harijan Temple Worship 
( Removal of disabilities Act ) and the Madras Temple Entry 
Authorisation and Indemnity Act of 1939. Much will depend 
upon the untouchables themselves. As am ong the caste Hindus* 
the Untouchables also have inter se numerous divisions and 
subdivisions each of whioh regards itself as superior to several 
others of them and will not condescend to mix with them in the 
public or dine with them. They must also throw up from among 
themselves selfless and capable leaders. This is a vast problem 
and the appalling evils which have been growing for ages can- 
not be wholly removed in a day. The leaders of the so-called 
untouchables also should not make exaggerated claims. For 
the present they should rest content with equality in public 
places, public services and before the law and at the most 
entry into public temples. But if they indulge in the tall talk 
of destroying the caste system at one stroke and requiring that 
all caste Hindus should dine with them and inter-marry with 
them, they may find that at least two hundred millions of 
caste Hindus will be dead opposed to them, and the cause 
of the removal of the evils of untouchability is bound to 
suffer a set-back. Besides it should not be forgotten that 
the amelioration of the condition of untouchables is bound 
up with the problem of the poverty of the entire rural 
population of India. It should not be supposed that all the 
untouchables are the poorest of the poor. I know from personal 
knowledge that many among certain classes of untouchables 
like the Mahars and Ohambhars of the Decoan are economically 
better off than the ordinary oultivators in many villages. The 
mahars are hereditary village servants in the Deccan and they 
recover from every householder bread every day as part of 
their remuneration or a certain measure of corn from the 
threshing floor. Vide Grant Duff's * History of the Marathas â¢ ( ed. 
of 1863 vol. I p. 23 ) for the balutedars ( village servants ) among 
whom the makir occupies an important place and Hereditary 
Offices Act (Bombay Act III of 1874, section 18) for Legislative 
recognition of their ancient rights. The population of untou- 
chables in India has been estimated at various figures from three 



Oh. IV ] Untouchability 179 

crores to six crores. The Simon Commission Report ( 1930 ) vol. 
I. p. 40 estimated that there were about 43 millions of untoucha- 
bles in the whole of India, the criterion adopted being whether 
pollution by touch or approach within a certain distance is 
caused. The ratio of untouchables to the total population of 
India or to the Hindu population varies greatly in different parts 
of India. The total Harijan ( the name given to untouchables 
by Mahatma Gandhi ) population is 14 per cent of the whole 
population of India. In the Bombay Presidency the ratio of 
Harijans to Hindus is only about eleven per cent being the 
lowest of all provinces and States in India, while in Bengal the 
ratio is about 32 per cent which is the highest in India except 
in Assam. 418 The High Courts in India have held that the 
untouchables are included among sudras for purposes of 
marriage. Vide Sohan Singh vs. Kabla Singh 10 Lahore 372, 
Muthusami vs. Masilamani 33 Mad. 342. 419

question of untouchables in India. Vide "The Psychology of a

CHAPTER V 

SLAVERY 

Slavery has existed as a constant element in the social and 
economical life of all nations of antiquity such as Babylon, 
Egypt, Greece, Rome and also of many nations of Europe. **Â° 
It was however left to such Christian nations of the West as 
England and the United States of America to carry on the 
institution of slavery in the most horrible manner possible 
never dreamt of by any nation of antiquity, viz. by sending out 
kidnapping expeditions to Africa to collect slaves, to huddle 
them in ships in such unspeakably filthy conditions that half 
of them died on the voyage, to sell them to plantation owners 
and others like chattel. Westermarck in his ' Origin and 
Development of the moral ideas' vol. I ( 1912 ) p. 711 was 
constrained to observe ' This system of slavery, which at least 
in the British colonies and slave states surpassed in cruelty the 
slavery of any pagan country ancient and modern, was not 
only recognised by Christian Governments but was supported 
by the large bulk of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant alike. * 
Slavery was abolished in the British Dominions only in 1833 
and in British India by Act V of 1843. 

It has been seen above (pp. 26-27) that the word 'dasa* in the 
Rg. generally stands for the opponents of the aryas. It is possible 
that when the dasas were vanquished in battle and taken 
prisoners they were treated as slaves. In the Rgveda, however, 
there are not many passages where the word ' dasa ' can be said 
to have been used in the sense of slave. In Rg VIII. 56. 3 421 we 

420. Vide Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, vol. XIV, p. 74 'To the 
ancient mind slavery was a fixed and accepted element of life and no 
moral problem was involved. That slavery already was established as 
a recognized institution in the Sumerian culture of the Babylonian area 
in the 4th millenium B. C. may be confidently assumed from the frag- 
ments of Sumerian legislation upon slaves which date from the first half 
of the 3rd millenium 1 .

read ' thou madest a gift to me of one hundred donkeys, of one 
hundred fleece-bearing ewes and one hundred dSsas \ It appears 
that here dasa means slaves or serfs. In Rg VIII. 5. 38 the sage 
praises his patron Caidya Kasu * the common people sit down at 
the feet of Caidya Ka&u like men crowding round tanners of 
hides, ( Caidya ) who honoured me by giving me ten noblemen 
that were like gold in appearance \ Hare probably there is an 
allusion to the gift of ten captured nobles made to the sage by 
Caidya KaSu, the victor. A sage declares in 5g. VIII. 19. 36 
' Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, gave me fifty young women \ 
This probably refers to the gift of female slaves ( daals ). The 
Tai. S. VII. 5. 10. 1 says ' dasls ( girl slaves ) place on their 
heads jars full of water and singing this madhu and beating 
their feet against the ground dance round the marjaliya ' &o. 428 
The Tai. S. II. 2. 6. 3. refers to the gift of a horse or a male 
( slave ). ' He obtains a portion of himself who aocepts ( in gift ) 
a being with two rows of teeth, ( such as ) a horse or a human 
male ; on accepting an animal with two rows of teeth one should 
offer to VaiSvanaTa a mess cooked on twelve potsherds' 428 . 
The Ait. Br. 39.8 mentions large gifts such as 10,000 girls 
( dasl ) and 10,000 elephants made by a king to his purohita 
performing coronation. When the angel of Death tries to dissuade 
Naciketas from his curiosity to know the destiny of a person 
after death, he tempts the inquirer ( Katha Up. 1. 1. 25)* Here are 
such handsome women with chariots and musical instruments 
as cannot be secured ( ordinarily ) by men ; make them, when 
gifted by me, serve you ; do not ask me what happens after 
death'. The women referred to were probably meant to be 
serving ( or slave ) girls who attended on a man as maids and 
who could dance and sing. In the Br. Up. IV. 4. 23 Janaka 
after receiving instruction in Brahmavidya from YajSavalkya 
exclaims ' I make a gift to your honour of the Videhas together 
with myself for being your slave \ We read in the Chan. Up. 
1 In this world they speak of cows and horses, elephants and 
gold, wives and slaves, fields and houses as mahima (greatness).*

Vide also Chan. Up. V. 13. 2 and Br. Up. VI. 2. 7 for references 
to dssls. These passages show that in the Vedio period men 
and women had become the subjects of gifts and so were in 
the condition of slaves. 

Though Manu ordained ( I. 91, VIII. 413, 414 ) that the 
principal duty of the 6udra was to wait upon the three higher 
oastes or that the siidra was created by the Creator for the 
service of brahmanas, the siidra who thus served a dvijati as 
a duty was not his slave. Jaimini ( VI. 7. 6 ) 424 makes this 
perfectly clear by saying that when a man makes a gift in the 
Visvajit sacrifice of everything belonging to himself he cannot 
make a gift of the siidra who waits upon him as his duty. 
Sahara in his bh5$ya adds ' the siidra may not desire to serve 
the man to whom the sacrificer gives his all and the latter has 
no power over him if he is unwilling. * 

We have seen how the Grhya Sutras speak of dasas 
being employed to wash the feet of honoured guests. It 
appears that the ideal placed before the masters was to 
treat the slave humanely. Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. II 485 says that 
one may indeed stint oneself, one's wife or son ( as to food ) 
if guests come, but never a dasa who does one's menial 
work ( or a dasa and hired servants ). In the Anu6asana- 
parva 4 * 8 it is stated ' one should not sell a human being who 
is a stranger; how much more one's own children*. In the 
Mahfibharata gifts of dasas and dasls are very frequently men- 
tioned. In Sabhfiparva 52. 45, Vanaparva 233. 43 and Virata 
18. 21 gifts of 30 dasls to each of 88000 snataka brahmanas are 
spoken of. In Vanaparva 185. 34 Vainya is said to have given 
a thousand handsome dfisls with ornaments on to Atri. Vide 
Dronaparva 57. 5-9. Manu ( VIII, 299-300 ) places a slave on 
the same level as one's son in the matter of corporal punish- 
ment ' the wife, the son, the slave, a menial servant, one's full 
brotherâ these when guilty of wrong may be beaten with a rope

punished as a thief. * 

Slavery was probably not much 427 in evidence in India 
in the 4th century B. C. or the treatment of slaves in India was 
so good that a foreign observer like Megasthenes accustomed 
to the treatment of slaves in Greece thought that there was no 
slavery, Megasthenes ( MacCrindle, p. 71 ) states that none 
of the Indians employs slaves ( vide Strabo XV. 1. 54 ). That 
slavery existed then admits of no doubt. The Emperor Asoka 
when proclaiming his Law of Piety enjoins in his 9fch Rock 
Edict that the Law of Piety consists ( among other things ) in 
the kind ( or proper ) treatment of slaves ( dasas ) and hired 
servants. In the Arthasastra ( III. 13 ) Kautilya 428 gives very 
important provisions about slaves. He says that the mlecchas 
are not punishable if they sell or pledge their children, but an 
ftrya cannot be reduced to slavery. He then prescribes that if 
a relative sells or pledges a sudra ( who is not born as a slave ) 
or a vaisya or ksatriya or a brahmana ( all being minors ), he 
should be respectively fined 12, 24, 36 and 48 panas and that if 
a stranger sells or pledges the above then the vendor, the vendee 
and the abettors will be liable to the first, middle and highest 
ammercements and whipping respectively ( i. e. first ammerce- 
ment for sale of a sudra by a stranger and whipping 
for the sale of a brahmana). But he allows the pledge of 
even an arya in family distress. He refers to several kinds 
of slaves viz. dhvajahrta ( captured in battle ), atmavifcrayin 
( who sells himself ), udaradasa ( or garbhadasa, one who is 
born to a dasl from a slave ) or those so made for a debt 
( ahitika ), or for a fine or court's decree ( dandapranlta ). He 
then prescribes how they are set free from slavery. One who 
sells himself or is pledged or is born a slave becomes a free 
man by paying off respectively the amount for which he was 
purchased or pledged or what would be a proper price. One 
who is made a slave for a fine may pay off the fine by doing 
work. One captured in war may become free by paying accor- 
ding to the time he has been in bondage and the work he did 
or by paying half of it. The child of one who sells himself 

427. Vide Rhys Darids in * Buddhist India Â» ( 1903 ) p. 263. 
III. 18. 



184 History of Mormaiastra [ Ch. V 

remains an arya ( free man ). He prescribes that if a master 
makes a pledged slave carry a corpse or sweep ordure, 
urine or leavings of food, or keeps him naked, beats him or 
abuses him or violates the chastity of a female slave, he forfeits 
the price paid by him. He prescribes the first ammercement 
for a master having intercourse with a pledged slave girl 
against her will and middle ammercement for a stranger 
doing so. 

Mauu (VIII. 415) speaks of seven kinds of dasas, viz. one 
captured in battle, one who becomes so for food ( i. e. in scarcity 
or in a famine), one born in the house ( i. e. of a female slave ), 
one bought, one given ( by his parents or relatives ), one inheri- 
ted ( as part of the patrimony ), one who becomes so for paying 
off a fine or judicial decree. He states the general rule ** 9 that 
the wife, the son and the slave have no wealth and whatever 
they earn belongs to him whose wife, son or slave they are. 
Manu prescribes a fine of 600 panas for a brahmana making a 
member of the dvijati castes after his upanayana a slave 
against his will. 

NSrada ( abhyupetyasusrusa ) and Katyayana among the 
smrtikaras contain the most elaborate treatment on slavery. 
Narada first says that a susrusaka ( one who serves another ) is 
of five kinds viz. a Vedic student, an antevasin ( an apprentice 
who is learning a craft ), adhikarmakrt ( a supervisor over 
workmen), bhrtaka (hired servant) and dasa. The first four are 
called hat ma kara. They can be called upon to do only work 
that is pure, while a dasa may have to do impure work 43 Â° such 
as cleaning the entrances to the house, filthy pits (for leavings 
of food ), the road, dunghill heaps, touching ( or scratching ) 
private parts, taking up and throwing away ordure and urine 
( verses 6-7 ), doing bodily service to the master if he so desires. 
Narada mentions 15 kinds of slaves viz. one born in the 
house, one bought, one acquired ( by gift or other means ),

one Inherited, one saved in a time of famine, one pledged 
by the master, one discharged from a large debt, one cap- 
tured in a battle, one vanquished in a bet, one who accepts 
slavery by saying * I am yours \ an apostate from the 
order of asceticism, one who stipulates to be a slave ( for 
a certain time ), one who is a slave for food ( as long as food is 
given to him ), one who i3 tempted to become a slave out of 
love for a female slave, and one who sells himself. Narada says 
that the first four of these are not freed from slavery except by 
the favour of the master ( v. 29 ), while one who sells himself is 
the worst kind of slave and he also does not become free from 
slavery (v. 37). Narada (v. 30) and Yaj. (II. 182) state a 
rule applicable to all slaves, viz. that when a slave saves a 
master from imminent danger to the latter's life the slave 
becomes a free man and ( Narada adds ) that he gets a share in 
the inheritance as a son. One who is an apostate from the 
order of ascetics is a slave of the king till the former's death 
( Yaj. II. 183 ). One saved in a famine becomes free by giving 
a pair of cows, one pledged 421 if the master who pledged him 
repays the debt, the slave in lieu of discharge of debt by paying 
off the debt with interest, one who accepted slavery or who was 
captured in battle or became so under a bet is freed by giving 
a substitute who is equal to him in work, one for a stipulated 
period by the lapse of the period, one who is a bhakta-dasa 
becomes free by the master ceasing to give food, one who is 
' vadavahrta ' ( tempted by a female slave ) by abandoning his 
intercourse with her ( Narada vv. 31-34, 36 ). Yaj. ( II. 182 ) and 
Narada ( v. 38 ) say that one who was made a slave by force 
or was carried away by raiders and sold should be set free by 
the king. Yaj. ( II. 183 ) and Narada ( v. 39 ) prescribe that a 
man can be a slave to a master only in the proper order of 
varnas 438 i. e. the three varnas next to a brahmana may be 
slaves to a brahmana, a vaisya or a 6udra may be a slave 
to a ksatriya but a ksatriya cannot be the slave of a vaisya or 
a 6udra, nor a vai&ya of a sudra. There is one exception viz. an 
apostate from asceticism may be the slave of a vaisya or a 6udra 

431. A slave who is pledged becomes the slave of two till the 
pledge is redeemed.

king. K&tySyana emphasizes that a brahmana 4 ** cannot be 
made a slave even to a brahmana, but if he himself chooses, he 
may do pure work for a brahmana endowed with charaoter and 
Vedic learning, but no impure work. Katyayana ( v. 721 ) 
says that when a brahmana becomes an apostate from the order 
of asceticism he should be banished from the kingdom and the 
ksatriya or vaisya apostate may become a slave to the king* 
Daksa ( VII. 33 ) quoted by Apararka ( p. 787 ) adds that the 
apostate's head should be branded with the mark of dog's foot. 

Kautilya 484 and Katyayana ( v. 723 ) both declare that if a 
master has sexual intercourse with a female slave and she is 
delivered of a child, both the slave and the child should be 
given freedom by the master. 

Kautilya declared that the heirs to the wealth of a slave 
are his relatives and if none of them exist then the master, 
while Katyayana 435 says that the only wealth that the slave 
can call his own is the price he received for selling himself or 
what the master gave as a gift through favour. 

Narada ( vv. 42-43 ) describes the ceremony of the manu- 
mission of a slave " when a master being pleased with a slave 
desires to make him a free man, he should take, from the slave's 
shoulder, a jar full of water and break it, he should sprinkle 
water mixed with whole grains of rice and flowers on the slave's 
head and thrice uttering the words * you are no longer a slave * 
he should dismiss him with the ( slave's ) face to the east. " 

The Vyavaharamayukha m quotes a verse from the 
Kalikapurfina about an adopted son, which is very interesting 
4 persons adopted and the like on whom the sarhskaras of ca^a 
( tonsure ) and Upanayana are performed by the gotra of the 
adopter, become sons of ( the adopter )> otherwise the person ( on 
whom such ceremonies are not performed ) is held to be a slave

(of the adopter).* The VyavaharamayGkha remarks that this 
passage Is not reliable as it is not found in several mss. of the 
KalikSpurana. Narada mentions 15 kinds of slaves, but this is 
not one of them. All that the Kalikapurana probably means is 
that when a boy is adopted into another family after his cuda 
and upanayana are performed in the family of birth, he is 
not fully affiliated in the family of adoption, he does not 
become a son and so does not take the inheritance but is only 
entitled to maintenance in the family of adoption, just as a 
slave is to be fed. No digests have recognised such a person as 
a slave proper. 

Narada* 37 ( rnadana 12) and Katyayana declare that a 
debt contracted by a Vedic pupil, an apprentice, a slave, the 
wife, a menial servant and a workman for the benefit of the 
family even though it was incurred in his absence, was bind- 
ing on the owner of the house. Ordinarily a slave was not a 
competent witness, but Manu VIII. 70 and Usanas ( quoted in 
VyavahSramayukha p. 37 ) say that when no other witness is 
available, a minor, an old man, a woman, a pupil, a relative, a 
slave'or a hired servant may be a witness. 

There are numerous works dealing with slavery in its 
various aspects. The latest book on the subject is ' Slavery 
through the ages' by Sir George Mac Munn ( 1933 ). Mr. D. R. 
Banaji has published a very painstaking and interesting study 
on ' Slavery in British India ' from 1772 to 1843 (2nd ed. 1937) 
The Carnegie Institution of Washington has published studies 
on several aspects such as ' Judicial Cases * ( by Mrs. Catterall 
in 1926 ) and * Documents of the history of the Slave Trade to 
America, 1930 ' by Prof. Elizabeth Donnan. Dr. H. J. Nieboer's 
* Slavery as an Industrial System ' ( 1910 ) is a well- 
documented study of slavery in various countries and at 
various times.

CHAPTER VI 

SAMSKARAS 

Gautama ( II. 1 ) says that before upanayana, a boy may 
act, speak and eat as and what he likes ( i. e. may follow his 
inclinations ). Haradatta explains that this does not mean that 
he can kill a brahmana or drink liquor, but that there is no 
restriction, although he be a brahmana's son, to his selling 
what is forbidden to a brahmana to sell, or he may eat onions 
and garlic or stale food or may eat four or five times a day, 
Â£p. Dh. S. 428 ( II. 1. 6. 15. 17-20 ) states several views on this 
point. 'Up to the time when they begin to take cooked food 
infants do not become impure ( by the touch of a rajasvala &c. ); 
according to some ( teachers ) up till they are one year old ; or 
till they are not able to distinguish the cardinal points; another 
view is that till upanayana (they do not become impure ) '. 
Aparfirka ( p. 28 ) also explains that a boy may ( before upa- 
nayana) eat the leavings of the food of his parents, but he 
cannot eat or drink what would cause loss of caste as in that 
case he may become unfit to have the samskara of upanayana 
performed on him. The Smrtyarfchasara gives the view of some 
that in case an infant touches a candala before it reaches the 
age of taking cooked food, only water need be sprinkled on 
it, before caula acamana need be done by it and after caula 
( and before upanayana ) a bath would be necessary. Vas. Dh. 
S. ( II. 6 ) quotes a verse of Harlta to the effect * up till investi- 
ture with the girdle of munja grass ( i. e. till upanayana ) there 
is no action that is obligatory on him, as long as he is not born 
again for Vedic study he may be in his conduct like a sudra' 48 *. 
This verse occurs also in Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 6 and Manu II. 
171 and 172. Daksa I. 3-4 says * Till a boy is eight years old 
he is like one newly born and only indicates the caste in which 
he is born. As long as his upanayana is not performed the

eaten, as to what should ( or should not ) be drunk, as to what 
he should or should not speak, as to telling a falsehood \ 440 
But this does not hold good as to mahapatakas. As to praya- 
Soitta when a child is guilty of the commission of a mahft- 
pStaka, see under prayascitta later on and the Mit. on Yaj. III. 253. 
The smrtis look upon upanayana as the second birth of a boy 
(the first being his physical birth) 441 . Gaut. (X. 1 and 51 ) 
says that the three higher classes are called dvijatis ( having 
two births ), while the Â£udra is only ekajati. 44a ip. Dh. S. says 
( 1. 1. 1. 16-18 )/ the teacher causes him ( the boy who is initiated 
into Vedio study ) to be born from vidya ( i.e. by imparting Vedic 
knowledge ), that birth is superior, the parents produce only the 
body M4S . Upanayana is like Baptism and St. John (3. 3 ) also 
says * except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom 
of God.' Manu H. 147-148 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 30. 45-46) 
convey the same idea. Manu ( II. 169 ) spea ks of three b irths 
in tbejtose ofaman U5rst_ birth from his mother, the second when 
the girdle is iJIeTjTi. e. on upanayana ) and ihe third when Jie 
is iruiiafed for a Vedic sacrifice. Upanayana is the foremo st 
of the samskSr as] A iri ( 111-142 ) says ' a person is known as 
a brShmana by birth, he is said to be a dvija ( twice-born ) on 
account of samskaras, he reaches the position o^Jkjmpra by 
learning ( sjudy of the Veda ) ; he is called 6r otriya on account 
oj L^Uhese three *. 444 PanTsara (VIII. 19) contains a fine 
image to illustrate this * just as a work of painting gradually 
unfolds itself on account of the several colours ( with which it 
is drawn), so brahmariya ( the status of a brahmana) is similarly

brought out by samskaras performed according to prescribed 
rite* ' 

Therefore it is now time to speak of sarhskSras. 

The word samskara hardly ever occurs in the ancient 
Vedic literature, but the root ' kr ' with ' sam ' and the past 
passive participle ' samskrta ' occur often enough. In Rg. 

V. 76. 2 the word samskrta is applied to 'gharma* (vessel) 
'the two A&vins do not harm the gharma that has been purified.' 
In ftg. VI 28. 4 we have the word samskrtatra' and Rg. 
VIII. 33. 9 has ' ranaya samskrfcah \ Sat. 445 Br. L 1. 4. 10 speaks 
of preparing (or purifying) offering (havis) for the gods. 
So in Sat. Br. III. 2. 1. 22 ' therefore a woman approaches 
a man who stands in a well-trimmed (samskrta) bouse.' 
Vide Vaj. S. IV. 34 for a similar use of samskrta. In 
Chan. Up. IV. 16. 2, we 446 read "of that sacrifice there 
are two ways, by mind, by speech; the Brahm& (priest) 
prepares ( or polishes ) one of them by his mind." The word 
samskftra is used several times in the sufcras of Jaimini ( as in 
III. 1. 3, III. 2. 15 and 17, III. 8. 3, IX. 2. 9, 42, 44, IX 3. 25, 
IX 4. 33, IX 4. 50 and 54, X, 1. 2 and 11 &o. ). It generally 
means some purificatory act in a sacrifice e. g. in Jaimini 
III. 8. 3 the word is applied to the actions of shaving the head, 
washing the teeth and paring the nails on the part of the 
saorificer in Jyotistoma ; in IX 3. 25 the word samskara is 
applied to proksana ( sprinkling with water ), in X 2. 49 it is 
applied to the shaving of the head and face. In Jaimini 447 

VI. 1. 35 the word samskara stands for upanayana. Sahara 
explains 448 samskara as that which being effected makes a 
certain thing or person fit for a certain purpose and the Tantra- 
vSrtika says that samskaras are those aotions and rites that

impart fitness and it further says **â¢ ' fitness is of two kinds ; 
it arises by the removal of taints ( sins ) or by the generation 
of fresh qualities. Samskaras generate fresh qualities, while 
tapas brings about the removal of taints. He who performs such 
sacrifices as Jyotistoma and others has certain blemishes in 
him due to not doing in this life or a previous life duties laid 
down for him or doing what is forbidden. If they ( blemishes ) 
are not removed they obstruct the ( acquisition of the ) reward 
of the sacrifice even if it be entirely free from any defects 
whatever, as they ( blemishes ) produce (for the sacrificer ) the 
experience of their own fruits that are opposed to the ( fruit 
of the ) sacrifice.' The Vlramitrodaya 450 ( on sarhskara ) defines 
* sarhskara ' as ' a peculiar excellence due to the performance 
of rites ordained ( by the sastra ) which resides either in the 
soul or the body ' and says that it is of two kinds, one kind 
making a person eligible for performing other actions ( e. gâ 
upanayana renders a person eligible for Vedic study ), while 
another kind removes the evil taint that may have been gene- 
rated ( e. g. Jatakarma removes the taint due to seed and uterus ). 
The word samskara does not occur in most of the grhyasutras 
( it occurs in Vaik. ), but ifc occurs in the Dharmasutras ( vide 
Gaut. VIII. 8, Ap. Dh. 1. 1. 1. 9, Vas. IV. 1 ). 

The principal matters that fall to be discussed under 
samskaras are : the purpose of samskaras, the classification of 
samskaras, the number of samskaras, the procedure of each of 
the samskaras and the persons authorized to perform them and 
the persons for whom they are to be performed. 

First as to the purpose of samskaras. Mann ( II. 27-28 ) 
says 'In the case of dvijatis, the taints ( or sins ) due to seed 
and the uterus ( i. e. derived from parents ) are wiped off by 
the homas (burnt oblations) performed during pregnancy and by 
jatakarma ( ceremonies on birth ), caula ( tonsure ) and the tying 
of the girdle of munja grass. This ( human ) body is rendered fit 
for the attainment of brahma by the study of the Veda, by 
( observance of ) vratas, homas ( oblations in fire ), by the 
vrata called traividya, by worship ( of gods, sages and manes ), 
by generation of sons, by the performance of the five daily

sacrifices and by ( solemn Vedic ) sacrifices/ The view of 
Yaj. ( 1. 13 ) is that ' thus ( i. e. by the performance of samskftras ) 
the taint arising from the seed and uterus ( i. e. from the 
physioal defects of parents ) is removed.' These words of 
Manu and Yaj. are variously interpreted by the commentators. 
Medhatithi says 'seed and uterus are not the causes of sin 
and therefore all that is meant by enas ( in Manu II. 27 ) is 
impurity.' Kulluka explains that blemishes of seed are those 
arising from intercourse in a prohibited manner and the 
'gSrbhika' blemish is what arises from having to stay in the womb 
of an impure mother. The Mit. 451 on Yaj. I, 13 makes it clear 
that samskaras are deemed to remove bodily defects trans- 
mitted from parents ( such as defective limbs, diseases &c. ) 
and are not intended to remove the taint of being born of sinful 
parents. Manu II. 66 also states that all the samskaras are 
performed on a woman also for the purification of the body. 
Harlfea 458 as quoted in the Samskaratattva says ' when a person 
has intercourse according to the procedure of garbhadhana he 
establishes in the wife a foetus that becomes fit for the reception 
of the Veda, by the rite oipumsavana he makes the garbha become 
a male, by the ceremony of Slmantonnayana he removes from 
the foetus the taint derived from the parents and the accumu- 
lated taints ( which are five ) due to seed, blood and womb are 
removed by jatakarma, namakarana, aunapra&ana, cudakarana 
and samavartana. By these eight samskaras ( from garbha- 
dhana) purity arises.' The exact significance of samskaras 
in the development of higher human personality was left rather 
vague in our authorities and their treatment of the purpose of 
samskaras is not very elaborate or exhaustive. The sarhskftras 
had been treated from very ancient times as necessary for 
unfolding the latent capacities of man for development and as 
being the outward symbols or signs of the inner change which 
would fit human beings for corporate life and they also tended 
to confer a certain status on those who underwent them. If 
we look at the list of samskaras we shall find that the purposes

of samskaras were manifold. Some like Upanayana served 
spiritual and cultural purposes, they brought the unredeemed 
person into the company of the elect, they opened the door to 
Vedio study and thus conferred special privileges and exacted 
duties. They have also psychological values impressing on the 
mind of the person that he has assumed a new role and must 
strive to observe its rules. Other samskaras like nSmakarana, 
annaprSfiana, and niskramana were more or less of a popular 
nature. They afforded opportunities for the expression of 
love and affection and for festivities. Other samskaras like 
garbhadhana, purhsavana, slmantonnayana had also mystical 
and symbolical elements. Vivaha (marriage) was a saorament 
which brou-^+j about a union of two personalities into one for 
the purpose of the continuance of society and for the uplift 
of the two by self-restraint, by self-sacrifice and mutual 
co-operation. 

The samskaras were divided by Harlta into two kinds, 
brahma and daiva. 452 The samskaras of garbhadhana and 
others which are described only in the smrfcis are called brahma 
and the man who is purified by performing them attains 
equality with sages, stays in the same world with them and is 
joined with them ; pakayajfias ( offerings of cooked food ), 
yajiias with burnt offerings and sacrifices in which soma is 
offered are called daiva ( samskaras ). The last two varieties, 
viz. those in which there is burnt offering and those in which 
soma is offered, are dealt with in the srauta sufcras, which have 
been left outside the purview of this work ( except in the note 
at the end of this volume ). 

There is a great divergence of views among the writers 
on smrtis as to the number of samskaras. Gaut. ( VIIL 14-24 ) 
speaks of forty samskaras and eight virtues of the soul. The 
forty samskaras are : garbhadhana, purhsavana, slmantonnayana, 
jatakarma, namakarana, annaprasana, caula, upanayana (8

but no soma) viz. Agnyadheya, Agnihotra, DarsapurnamSsa, 
Agrayana, CaturmSsyas, NirudhapaSubandha and Sautramanl); 
seven soma sacrifices ( Agnistoma, Atyagnistoma, Ukthya, 
Sodasin, Vajapeya, 6 Atiratra, Apfcoryama). Gautama uses the word 
sarhskSra in the most extended sense. Sankha as quoted by the 
Sm. 0. (I. p. 13) and the SubodhinI on Mit. II. 4 follow Gautama. 
Vaik. speaks of eighteen 6arlra samskaras ( in which he includes 
utthSna,pravSs5gamana,pindavardhana, which are seen nowhere 
else as samskaras ) and twenty-two yajfias ( i. e. five daily yajnas 
as one and seven pakayajnas, seven havir-yajfias, and seven 
soma yajnas ). Most grhyasutras, dharmasutras and smrtis do 
not enumerate so many. Angiras ( quoted in the Sarhskara- 
mayukha, Sarhskara-prakaSa p, 135 and other digests) mentions 
twenty-five samskaras. They include all samskaras of Gautama 
from garbhadhana to the five daily yajnas ( which latter are 
reckoned as one sarhskara by Angiras ) and after namakarana 
niskramana is added. Besides, Visnubaii, Agrayana, Astaka, 
SravanI, AsvayujI, Marga&IrsI ( same as AgrahayanI ), Parvana, 
Utsarga and Upakarma are enumerated as the remaining 
samskaras by Angiras. Veda-Vyasa I. 14-15 enumerates 
Bixteen samskaras. Manu, Yftj., Visnu Dh. S, do not give the 
number of samskaras but simply say that they are those from 
niseka ( garbhadhana ) to smaSana ( i. e. antyesti ). This last 
one is not treated of in Gautama and several grhyasutras. In 
most of the digests the principal samskaras are said to be 
sixteen; but there is some difference of opinion even as to 
these sixteen. 455 For example, Jatukarnya as quoted in Sam. 
Pr. ( p. 135 ) enumerates the 16 as garbhadhana, purhsavana, 
slmanta, jatakarma, namakarana, annasrasiana, caula, mauiijl 



454. According to some the seven pakayajnas are : aupBsanahoroa, 
vaUvadeva, pSrYaoa ( sthailpska), astafri^Vfr&^WnfniJr ), sarpabali 
and I^Snabali. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 13. The Baud. gr. I. 1. gives the seven 
pSkayajnas as huta, prahuta, ahuta, riulagava, baliharana, pratyavarohana 
and astaka homa. Vide S. B. E. Vol. 30 p. 358 for several differing

( upanayana ), vratas ( four ), godana, samavartana, vivaha and 
antyesti. These slightly differ from the sixteen of Veda-Vyasa. 

The grhyasutras deal with samskaratf in two different 
sequences. Many of them begin with vivaha ( marriage ) and 
then proceed up to samavartana. Some like the Hiranya- 
ke&igrhya, Bharadvajagrhya and Manavagrhya begin with 
upanayana. 456 Some samskaras like Karnavedha and Vidyfi- 
rambha are conspicuous by their absence in the grhyasutras, 
but are added by later smrfcis and puranas. The following is 
the list of all the samskaras usually so called in most of the 
smrti works together with a few remarks against each as to the 
work or works in which each is mentioned or described. The 
samskaras are arranged in the sequence of the times at which in

garbhadhana ; it calls it niseka also ( VI. 2 ) and describes it 
in III. 9 and garbhadhana in III. 10. The Vaik. commence* 
the samskaras with niseka. 

Garbhadhana : Niseka : Caturthikarma or-homa : â Manu ( IL 
16 and 26 ), Yaj. 1. 10-11, Visnu Dh. S. ( 2. 3 and 27. 1 ) employ 
the word niseka as equivalent to garbhadhana. In the Sankha* 
yana grhya ( 1. 18-19 ), Par. gr. I. 11, and Ap. gr. ( 8. 10-11 ) 
the rite called caturthikarma or caturthlhoma takes the 
place of the rite called garbhadhana elsewhere and there is no 
separate description of garbhadhana in these and some similar 

456. For detailed treatment of some of the samskaras, vide Dr. 
(Mrs.) Kamalabai Deshpande's work 'the Child in ancient India* (with 
copious references to the grhya siltras ); Mrs. Stevenson's * the Rites of 
the twice-born' (1920), which exhaustively reviews in the minutest 
details the rites of brShmanas ( particularly in Kathiawar and Gujarat ) 
as observed at present. This work however gives hardly any ref erenoei 
to original Sanskrit authorities, is permeated by the spirit of a Christian 
missionary and commits the mistake, usual with most Western writers, 
of comparing hoary Indian customs, usages and the position of women 
with those of the West only in the latter half of the. 19th century, alto- 
gether ignoring what existed in Europe over a few hundred years ago, 
though it is generally written with sympathy and understanding.

grhyasutras. The Baud. gr. ( IV. 6. 1 ), the Katbakagrhya 
( 30. 8 ), Gaut. ( VIII. 14 ), Yaj. 1. 11 employ the word garbhS- 
dhana. According to Vaik. ( III. 10 ) the garbhadhana rite 
follows niseka or rtu-samgamana ( union of married pair after 
menstruation ) and consists in ensuring conception. 

Pumsavana: â occurs in almost all the grhyasutras, in 
Gaut., in Yaj. ( I. 11 ). 

Oarbharaksana : â mentioned in the Sankhayana gr. ( I. 21 ). 
It seems to be the same as the Anavalobhana which according 
to the Asvalayana gr. ( 1. 13. 1 ) occurs in the Upanisad and which 
is described in As v. gr. ( I. 13. 5-7 ). 

Simantonnayana : â This occurs almost everywhere. Yaj. I. 
11 uses the word slmanta. 

Vtsnubali : â mentioned in Baud. gr. ( I. 10. 13-17 and 
I. 11. 2 ), Vaik. ( III. 13 ), Angiras. It is not mentioned by 
Gautama and several other ancient sQtrakaras. 

Sosyantuharma or-homa: â described in Khadira and Gobhila. 
It is called Sosyantl-savana in Kathaka-grhya and Ksiprasuvana 
in Ap. gr., Bharadvaja gr. and Ksipraprasavana in Hir. gr. 
( S. B. E. vol. 30, p. 210 ). It occurs in Budhasmrti ( as quoted 
in Samskara-prakasa p. 139 ). 

Jatakarma : â This is described in all stttras and smrtis. 

Utthana :â mentioned only in the Vaik. ( III. 18 ) and in 
6an. gr. I. 25 ( S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 51-52 ). 

Namakarana :â mentioned in all smrtis. 

Niskramana or Upaniskramar^a or Adityadarsana or Nirna- 
yana:â Yaj. I. 11 speaks of it as Niskramana, Par. gr. ( 1. 17 ) as 
Niskramanika, Manu II. 34 speaks of it as Niskramana. The 
Kausikasfttra 58. 18 calls it Nirnayana; while Baud. gr. 
(II. 2 ) employs the word upaniskramana ; Manava gr. ( I. 
19. 1 ), Visnu Dh. S. ( 27. 10 ), Sankha ( in verse, II. 5 ) employ 
appropriately the name Adityadarsana. Gaut., Ap. gr. and 
several other sutras omit it. 

Karyavedha : â -omitted in almost all ancient smrtis ; men- 
tioned in Veda-Vyasa srarti ( I. 19 ), Baud. gr. sesa-sutra ( I. 
12. 1 ), Katyayana-sutra ( a supplement to Par. gr. ) 

Annapraiana : â mentioned by almost every smrti. 

Varsavardhana or Abdapurti :â 'mentioned in Gobhila, San, 
Par., Baud. 



Oh. VI ] Samskaras 19^ 

Caula or CudaJcarma or Cudakarana ' â mentioned by all 
smrtis. 

Vidyarambha : â not mentioned in any smrti but only in 
Markandeyapurana quoted by Apararka (p. 30 ) and Sm. C. 
(I. p. 26). 

Upanayana : â mentioned by all. It is called vratadesa in 
Veda-Vyasa I, 14. 

Vratas ( four ) : â mentioned by most of the grhyasutras. 

Kesanta or Oodana : â Mentioned by almost all. 

Samavartana or Snana : â there is great divergence about 
these two. Manu ( III. 4 ) seems to keep snana ( ceremonial bath 
after the period of studentship is over ) as distinct from sama- 
vartana. Gaut., ip. gr. V. 12-13, Hir. gr. I. 9. 1, Yaj. I. 51, 
Par. gr. ( II, 6-7 ) employ the word snana for both the ceremo- 
nial bath and the rites of return from the teacher's house on 
finishing one's studies, while Asv. gr. ( III. 8. 1 ), Baud, gr, 
( II. 6. 1 ), San. gr. III. 1, Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 2. 7. 15 and 31 ) employ 
the word Samavartana. 

Vivaha : â Mentioned by all as a sarhskara. 

MahayajHas : â five daily yajfias ; mentioned by Gaut, 
Angiras and others. 

Utsarga : â ( seasonal giving up of Veda studies ) is men- 
tioned as a sarhskara in Vaik (LI) and by Angiras. 

UpWcarma : â ( yearly commencement of Veda study ) men- 
tioned as a sarhskara by Vaik. (LI) and by Angiras. 

Antyesti : â mentioned by Manu II. 16 and Yaj 1. 10. 

It is laid down that the samskaras from jatakarma to 
cudakarma were to be performed in the case of the twice-born 
classes with Vedic mantras when the child was a male and 
that in the case of girls the ceremonies were to be performed 
but without Vedic mantras ; vide Asv. gr. ( 1. 15. 12, I. 16. 6, 1. 
17. 18), Manu II. 66 t Yaj 1. 13. But marriage in the case of the 
girls of the three higher classes was to be performed with Vedic 
mantras ( Manu II, 67. Yaj. I. 13 ). 

The samskaras 488 from garbhadhana to upanayana alone 
were absolutely necessary in the case of all twice-born persons ;

the samskaras of snSna and vivfiha were not obligatory, as a 
man was allowed to become a samnySsin ( ascetio) immediately 
after finishing the period of studenthood (according to the J&balo- 
panisad ). The SarhskaraprakaSa enters upon an elaborate 
discussion as to whether jatakarma could be performed for 
a child that is neither a male nor a female ( pp. 195-197 ) and 
arrives at the conclusion that jatakarma and other samskaras 
cannot be performed for a Mlba ( impotent ) child. 

Another question was as to what samskaras could be per- 
formed for the Sudra. The view of Vedavyasa that he could 
have ten samskaras performed ( but without Vedio mantras ) has 
been stated above ( p. 159 ). The Baijavapa 459 grhya says that 
seven samskaras are allowed to the Sudra viz. from garbhadhana 
( or niseka ) to caula. The view of Apararka 48 Â° appears to be that 
the eight samskaras from garbhadhana to caula ( in Yaj. 1.11-12) 
were meant for all varnas (including the Sudra). According 
to the Madanaratna, Rupanarayana and the bhasya of Harihara 
as quoted in the Nirnayasindhu, the Sudras were entitled to 
perform six samskaras viz. jatakarma, namakarana, niskra- 
mana, annapraSana, cuda and vivaha and the five daily maha- 
yajnas. The Sudrakrtya-tattva of Raghunandana ( p. 634 ) 
quotes a verse from the Varahapurana 4M * this very procedure 
(rabout Sraddha ) has been declared in the case of Sudras but 
without mantras ; for the Sudra who is not entitled to repeat a 
mantra, a brahmana repeats the mantra ' and then remarks that 
for a Sudra a mantra from the puranas is to be repeated by the 
brahmana priest employed, that the Sudra is not to repeat even 
the purana mantras but has only to eay ' namah '. The 
Nirnayasindhu 462 mentions with approval the same view of 
Sulapani that in all religious ceremonies for Sudras the man- 
tras are to be taken from the puranas and that they are to be 
repeated by the brahmana priest. The Brahmapurana 46J quoted

in the Sm. 0. ( I. p. 24 ) and other digests states that no other 
samsk&ra than vivSha is allowed to the sudra. On this the 
Ninpayasindhu remarks that these conflicting views are to be 
reconciled by holding that the liberal ones apply to good ( sat ) 
sudras and the stricter ones to low ( asat ) sudras or that the 
rules are different in different countries. 

It is to be noted that in modern times most of the sams- 
karas (except garbhSdhana, upanayana and vivaha) have fallen 
into oblivion and are hardly ever performed even by brahmanas 
in the manner and at the times prescribed by the smrtis. Owing 
to the rapid rise in the marriageable age of brahmana girls, 
even the samskara of garbbadhana is falling into abeyance. 
Namakarana, annaprasana are performed in a popular way 
but without Vedic mantras or without calling a priest to 
officiate. In most cases caula is performed on the day of the 
upanayana and samavartana is also performed a few days 
after upanayana. Jatakarma and annaprasana are performed 
on the same day in some parts (e. g. in Bengal). It appears 
that this state of things has continued for centuries. The 
Smrfcy arthasara 46 * (p. 3) says 'if the samskaras (except upa- 
nayana) are not performed at the prescribed times, the Vyahrti- 
homa should be offered and then the samskaras should be per- 
formed ( though late ). For each samskara that is not performed 
the penance called pSdakrcchra should be performed ( if the non- 
performance is due to some difficulty or distress ), and for non- 
performance of caula the penance is ardha-krochra. If the sams- 
karas were knowingly omitted or if there was no distress then the 
penance is double 465 of this/ The Nirnayasindhu quotes verses 
of Saunaka 466 to this effect and then remarks that there was 
a conflict of views, some holding that after the penance the 
samskaras passed over should be performed all at one time, 

464. The VyBhrtihoma consists in offering clarified butter with the 
mystic syllables, bhuh, bhuvah, svah (or surah) uttered separately 
and then together. Vide Hir. gi. I. 3.' 4 ( S. B. E.' Vol. 30 p. 144 ).

while others held that they should not be performed at all after 
undergoing penance and a third view was that if caula was 
left unperformed it may be performed on the same day as 
upanayana. The Dharmasindhu ( 3rd pariccheda, purvfirdha ) 
states various substitutes ( which are comparatively easy ) for 
these penances. For example, one prajapatya penance is equal 
to three Padakrcchras. In place of prajapatya the person guilty 
of the lapse may make the gift of a cow or ( in the absence 
of a cow ) may give one niska ( 320 gufijas ) of gold or one half 
or one-fourth of it ; one who is very poor may give one-eighth 
of a silver niska or corn of that value. There being these easy 
substitutes (pratyamnaya as they were called ) people gradually 
left off performing the several samskaras and concentrated 
themselves only on upanayana and vivalia. The whole life of a 
person was so very minutely worked out and overlaid with so 
much ritual in the grhyasmtras and smrtis that the tendency to 
neglect and change became insistent and inevitable. This 
tendency was helped by the accommodating spirit of the brahmana 
authors of later smrtis and digests that were ready to prescribe 
easier and easier substitutes for non-observance of the elaborate 
sacraments, pre-natal and post-natal. Haradatta in commenting 
on Gaut. I. 6 ( upanayanam brahmanasya astame ) remarks ' the 
teacher ( Gautama ) expounding upanayana first and passing 
over the samskaras like garbhadhana that precede upanayana 
in time conveys that upanayana is the principal samskara. 
Therefore even if the samskaras like garbhadhana did not take 
place owing to adverseness of fate, upanayana can be performed, 
but it follows that if upanayana be not performed there is no 
adhikara ( eligibility ) for marriage which follows only after 
upanayana/ m In modern times in undergoing prayascitta for 
non-performance of the samskaras up to caula rupees two have 
to be paid to the priest ( annas four for each of the samskaras 
not performed up to caula and annas eight for caula ). 468

The samskaras will now be described in detail. The 
material contained in the sutras, smrtis and nibandhas is so 
vast that only very concise statements can be made here. The 
method followed will be as follows. Each samskara will be 
described from a few representative grhya and dharma sutras 
such as the Asv. gr., Ap. gr., and references will be given to 
other important works. Only important parts of procedure can 
be noted, minute divergences among the several works being 
passed over. Greater details will be given in the caBe of the 
two ohief samskaras viz. upanayana and marriage which are in 
vogue even now. 469 

Oarbhadhana : â The beginnings of this ceremony are found 
very early. Atharvaveda V. 25 appears to be a hymn intended 
for the garbhadhana rite. Atharva V. 25. 3 and 5 are verses 
which occur in the Br. Up. VI. 4. 21 ; the passage of the Br. Up. 
VI. 4.13, 19-22 may be rendered thus: * At the end of three 
days ( after menstruation first appears ) when she ( wife ) has 
bathed, the husband should make her pound rice ( which is then 
boiled and eaten with various other things according as he 
desires a fair, brown or dark son or a learned son or a learned 
daughter ) ... and then towards morning, after having according 
to the rule of the SthallpSka performed the preparation of the 
clarified butter, he sacrifices from the Sthallpaka little by little, 

469. Besides the grbya sUtras, the dharmasntras, Manu, YSjnavalkya 
and other smrtis, the principal digests on samskSra relied upon here are 
the SamskSratattva of Raghunandana, the SamskaTamayukba of Nlla- 
kautha, the SarhskaTa-prakSia of Mitramidra, the Saihska*rakaustubha of 
Anantadeva and the SaraskararatnamttlS of GopinStha. Further, one 
should never lose sight of the fact that in a vast continent like India 
the various items in daily rites and ceremonies have always varied from 
age to 8ge, from province to province and from caste to caste. Innumer- 
able modifications were introduced and usages cropped up among the 
people, particularly owing to the influence of women, of which smrtis 
and digests take no notice. This was the state of things even several 
centuries before Christ. The Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 11. 20. 15 ) closes with the 
aphorism 'some teachers hold that the rest of the dharma a (not 
described here) may be understood from (the usages of) women and of all 
varnas \ The 2L4v, gr. ( I. 7. 1 ) states 'various indeed are the usages of 
the different countries and of the different villages ; one should observe 
them in marriage ceremonies.' This work does not profess to give the 
bewildering differences of the several dakhffs and the several pro- 
vinces of Modern India, but will restrict itself principally to Western 
India and the &6v. sntra, though important variations have been 
pointed out in many places.

saying 'This is for Agni, svfiha ; this is for Anumafci, sv5h& ; 
this is for divine Savifcr the true creator, svaha ! Having sacrificed 
he takes out the rest of the sice, eats it and after having eaten 
he gives some of it to his wife. Then he washes his hands, fills a 
water jar and sprinkles her thrice with water saying * Rise, oh 
VisvSvasu, seek another blooming girl, a wife with her husband.' 
Then he embraces her and says ' I am Ama, thou art Sa. Thou 
art S5, 1 am Ajna. I am the Saman, thou art the Rk. I am the 
sky, thou art the earth. Come, let us strive together that a male 
ohild may be begotten * ( VI. 4, 21-22 cannot be literally trans- 
lated for reasons of decency ). Briefly the husband has inter- 
course with her and repeats certain mantras * may Visnu make 
ready your private parts, may Tvasta frame your beauty, may 
PrajSpati sprinkle and may Dhata implant an embryo into you; 
Oh Sinlvall ! Oh Prthustuka ! implant embryo ( in her ), may the 
two Asvins who wear a garland of lotuses plant in thee an 

embryo... > As the earth has fire inside it, as heaven has 

Indra inside it, as the wind is inside ( as the embryo of ) the 
quarters, so I plant a garbha in thee, oh, so and so ( the name of 
the woman being taken)'. 470 In the Asv. gr. (I. 13. 1 ) it is 
expressly stated that in the Upanisad the ceremonies of Garbha- 
lambhana ( conceiving a child ), Pumsavana ( securing a male 
child ) and Anavalobhana ( guarding against dangers to the 
embryo ) are mentioned. Evidently this is a reference to the Br. 
Up. quoted above (where four mantras used in the garbhadhana 
samskara by Hir. and other grhya sutras occur ). 

The rite called caturthikarma is described in the SSnkhayana 
gr. ( I. 18-19, S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 44-46 ) as follows " Three 

470. Vido Appendix for text and 8. B. E. vol 15, pp. 220-221 for 
the translation of the passage. Max Muller notes that the passage 
'amohasmi ' occurs in the Atharvaveda XIV. 71, that a similar passage 
(where instead of 'sa" Warn' there is 'sa tram') occurs in Ait. Br. VIII. 27 
and that in the Chandogya Up. 1. 6. 1 sa" is explained as earth and â¢ ama â¢ 
as fire. The mantra 'may Visnu.. .embryo into you ' is Rg. X. 184. 1 = 
Atharraveda V. 25. 5, and the mantra ' oh Sinlvall.. .an embryo/ is Rg. X. 
184. 2= Atharva V. 25. 3 (where * Saras vati Â» is road for 4 prthustuke \ 
The Nirukta ( XI. 32. on #g. II. 32. 6 where we have an invocation to 
Sinivali in the words 'give us progeny', srstf ^fir f^f^T:) explains 
* prthuftuke â¢ as 'prthujaghane ' (having large buttocks or largo mass 
of hair ). The words * garbham dadhatu ' probably suggested the name 
* garbhadhana given to this rite. The Hir. gr. I. 7. 25. 1. has the 
above two mantras and also the mantra *as the earth &c ' (and another 
mantra also) which four occur in Bp. Up. VI. 4. 21-22 ; vide S. B. B.

nights after marriage having elapsed, on the fourth the'husband 
makes into fire eight offerings of cooked food to Agni, Vayu, 
S&rya ( the mantra being the same for all three except the name 
of the deity ), Aryaman, Varuna, Pusan ( mantras being the 
same for these three ), Prajapati ( the mantra is Rg. X. 121. 10 ), 
to ( Agni ) Svistakrt. Then he pounds the root of Adhyanda 
plant and sprinkles it into the wife's nostril with two verses 
( Bg. X. 85. 21-22 ) with svaha at the end of each. He should 
then touch her, when about to oohabit, with the words * the mouth 
of the Gandharva Vi^vavasu art thou \ Then he should murmur 
' into the breath I put the sperm, Oh ! so and so ( the name of the 
wife ) or he repeats the verse * as the earth has fire inside &c. 
( quoted above from Br. Up. VI. 4. 22 ) or several other verses in 
this strain ' may a male embryo enter thy womb as an arrow 
into the quiver ; may a man be born here, a son, after ten 
months '\ 471 The Par. gr. ( 1. 11, S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 288-290 ) 
also has a similar procedure. Ap. gr. ( 8. 10-11, S. B. E. vol. 30, 
pp. 267-268 ), Gobhila II. 5 ( S. B. E. vol. 30, pp. 51-52 ) give 
briefly a similar procedure, but refer to mantras given in the 
Mantrapatha ( e. g. Ap. M. P. 1. 10. 1. to I. 11. 11 ). To modern 
minds it appears strange that intercourse should have been 
surrounded by so much of mysticism and religion in the ancient 
sutras. But in ancient times every act was sought to be invested 
with a religious halo ; so much so that according to Hir. |gr. L 7. 
25.3. (S. B. E. vol. 30, p. 200) Atreya held that mantras were to be 
repeated at each cohabitation throughout life, while Badarfiyana 
prescribed that this was necessary only at the first cohabitation 
and after each monthly course. 478 The Hir. gr. ( I. 7, 23. 11 to 7, 
25, S. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 197-200 ) gives a very elaborate rite, but 
on the same lines as the above grhyasutras. One of the mantras 
is interesting on account of its reference to the cakrav&ka birds 
( I. 7. 24. 6 ), ' The concord that belongs to the cakravaka birds, 
that is brought out of the rivers of which the divine Gandharva 
is possessed, thereby we are concordant * ( S. B. E. vol. 30, 
p. 198 ). The Vaik. ( III. 9 ) oalls this ceremony rtusaihgamana 
and is similar to Ap. gr. and Hir. gr. It will be seen that the

caturthlkarma is treated by the grhya writers as part of the 
marriage rites and the rite was performed irrespective of the 
question whether it was the first appearance of menses or 
whether the wife had just before the marriage come out of her 
monthly illness. This indicates that it was taken for granted 
that the wife had generally attained the age of puberty at the 
time of marriage. As the marriageable age of girls came down 
it appears that the rite of caturfchlkarma was discontinued and 
the rite was performed long after the ritual of marriage and 
appropriately named garbhadhana. 

The smrtis and nibandhas add many details some of which 
will have to be noticed. Manu ( III. 46 ) and Yaj. I. 79 say 
that the natural period ( for conception ) is sixteen nights from 
the appearance of menses. Ap. gr. 9. 1 says 47S that each of 
the even nights from the 4fch to 16th ( after the beginning of the 
monthly illness ) are more and more suited for excellence of 
(male) offspring. Harlta also says the same. These two 
appear to allow garbhadhana on the fourth night, but Manu 
( III. 47 ), Yaj. ( I. 79 ) lay down that the first four nights must 
be omitted. Katyayana, ParSsara ( VII. 17 ) and others say 
that a woman in her menses is purified by bathing on the 4th 
day. Laghu-Asvalayana ( III. 1 ) says that the garbhadhana 
ceremony should be performed on the first appearance of menses 
after the 4th day has elapsed. The Sm. C. suggests that the 4th 
may be allowed if thGre is entire cessation of the flow. 474 Manu 
( IV. 128 ) and Yaj. I. 79 added further restrictions viz. that new 
moon and full moon days and the 8fch and 14th tithis of the 
month were also to be omitted. Astrological details were added 
by Yaj. I. 80 (that the Mula and Magha constellations 
must be avoided and the moon must be auspiciously placed ) 
and other later smrtis, which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. 
In the later smrtis like Laghu-Asvalayana III. 14-19 and 
in nibandhas like the Nirnayasindhu and Dharmasindhu 
elaborate discussions are hold about the months, tithis, week-

days, naksatras, colour of clothes, that were deemed to 
be inauspioious for the first appearance of menses and about 
the iantis (propitiatory rites) for averting their evil 
effects. Ap. gr., Manu (III. 48), Yaj. (I. 79), Vaik. III. 
9 hold that a man desirous of male issue should cohabit on 
the even days from the 4th day after the appearance of menses 
and if he cohabits on uneven days a female child is born. 
Hir. gr. 47S I. 7. 24. 8 ( S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 199 ) and Bharadvaja 
gr. ( I. 20 ) prescribe that a woman in her menses who takes 
a bath on the 4th day should attire herself in white ( or pure ) 
clothes, should ornament herself and talk with ( worthy ) 
brahmanas ( only ). The Vaik. ( III. 9 ) further adds that she 
should anoint herself with unguents, should not converse with 
a woman, or a 6udra, should see no one else except her husband, 
since the child born becomes like the male whom a woman 
taking a bath after the period looks at. Sankha-Likhita convey 
a similar eugenic suggestion, 476 viz. * Women give birth to 
a child similar in qualities to him on whomsoever their heart 
is set in their periods/ 

A debatable question is whether garbhadhana is a samskara 
of the garbha ( the child in the womb ) or of the woman. 
Gaut. VIII. 24, Manu. I. 16, and Yaj. 1. 10 indicate that it is 
a samskara of the garbha and not of the woman. Visivarupa 47t 
on Yaj. I. 11 expressly asserts that all samskfiras except 
Siraantommyana have to be performed again and again ( as they 
are the samskaras of the garbha ), while Simantonnayana being 
a samskara of the woman has to be performed only once and 
this opinion was in consonance with the usage in his days. 
Laghu-Aivalayana ( IV. 17 ) also holds the same view. MedhS- 
tithi 478 on Manu II. 16 says that the garbhadhana rite with 
mantras was performed after marriage only once at the time of 
the first cohabitation according to some, while according to

others it was to be performed after every menstruation till 
conception. Later works like the Mit. (on Yfij. L 11 ), the 
Sm. C, the Samskaratattva (p. 909) hold that garbhadhana, 
pumsavana 479 and slmantonnayana are samskfiras of the 
woman and are to be performed only once and quote Harlta 
in support. Apararka holds that slmantonnayana is performed 
only once at the first conception, while pumsavana is repeated 
at each conception. He relies on Par. gr. I. 15; and the Sams- 
kara-mayukha and the SariiskaraprakaSa (pp. 170-171) hold 
the same opinion. Sm. 0. ( I. p. 17 ) quotes a verse of Visnu that 
according to some even slmantonnayana is repeated at each 
conception. About the rules for women who are rajasvcUa ( in 
their monthly course ) vide later on. 

According to Kulluka ( on Manu II. 27 ), the Sm. C. ( I. p. 14 ) 
and other works garbhadhana is not of the nature of homa. The 
Dharmasindhu says that when garbhadhana takes place on 
the first appearance of menses, homa for garbhadhana is to be 
performed in the grhya fire, but there is no homa when the 
cohabitation takes place on the second or later appearance of 
menses ; that those in whose sutra no homa is prescribed should 
perform the garbhadhana rite on the proper day after the first 
appearance of menses by reciting the mantras but without 
homa. The Samskarakaustubha ( p. 59 ) relying on Grhyapari- 
6ista prescribes homa in which cooked food is to be offered to 
PrajSpati and seven offerings of ajya are to be offered in fire, 
three with the verses ' Vis^ur-yonim * ( Rg. X. 184. 1-3 ), three 
with * nejamesa * ( Ap. L_ i/. 1. 12. 7-9 ) and one with Rg. X 121. 
10 ( prajapate na ). 

All samskaras other than garbhadhana can be performed 
by any agnate in the absence of the husband ( vide Samskara- 
praka&a 480 p. 165).

Ch. VI ] Sarhskaras and homa 207 

As boma is necessary in numerous ceremonies and rites, the 
grhyasutras give a description of a model homa. Therefore here 
also it would be well to set out the description from the 
A&valayana 481 Grhyasutra ( I. 3, & B. E. vol 29 pp. 162-163 ), 
a few important points of difference being added from other 
grhyasutras and other works. 

44 Now wherever ( a person ) intends 488 to offer a sacrifice he 
should besmear ( with cowdung ) a sthandila ( a slightly raised 
square surface of sand or loose earth ) of the dimension at least 
of an arrow on all ( four ) sides ; let him then draw six lines 
( in all ) on it, one to the west ( of that part of the sthandila on 
which the fire is to be placed) but turned northwards, two 
lines turned towards the east but separately at the two ends ( of 
the line first drawn ) ; ( then he should draw ) three lines in the 
middle (of the two) ; let him then sprinkle (the sacred sthandila) 
with water, establish the ( sacred ) fire ( on the sthandila ), put 
( two or three samidhs ) on the fire ; then he should perform 
parisamuhana (i. e. wiping or sweeping the ground round the fire), 
then paristarana ( i. e. strewing darbha grass round ) to the east 
to the south, to the west, to the north (in order ) ; in this way 
( all acts like parisamuhana, paristarana &c. ) should end in the 
north. Then silently he should sprinkle ( water ) round ( the 
fire ). (2) With two ( kusa blades used as ) strainers ( pavitra ) the 
purifying of the ajya is done. (3) Having 483 taken two kuSa 
blades with unbroken ends, which do not bear a young shoot in 
them, of the measure of a span, at their ends with his thumb 
and fourth finger, with hands turned the inside being upwards, 
he purifies the ajya ( from the west ) towards the east with (the 
words) 4 by the urging of Savitr I purify thee with this uninjured 
pavitra, with the rays of the Vasu ( i> e. rich or good ) sun \ once 
with this mantra, twice silently. (4) The strewing of kuSa 
grass ( paristarana ) round the fire may or may not be done in 
the ajya homas ( i. e. sacrifices in which clarified butter alone 
is to be offered into the fire ). (5) So also the two ajya portions 
( may optionally be offered ) in the Pakayajnas. (6) And ( the

employment in all Pakayajnas ) of the brahmfi priest is optional 
except in the Dhanvanfcari sacrifice and Sulagava sacrifice. (?) 
He should offer the sacrifice with the words ' to such and such 
a deity, svaha '. (8) If there is no specific direction ( as to the 
deities to whom the offerings are to be made ), the deities are 
Agni, Indra, Prajapati, Vi6ve Devas ( all gods), BrahmS. 484 At 
the end there is an offering to Agni Svistakrfc ( vide Appendix 
under note 481 for the mantra ). 

In the Sankhayana gr. I. 7 ( S. B. E. vol. 29 pp. 22-31 ) the 
prooedure described is more elaborate and contains some 
important differences. The performer ( I. 7. 6-7 ) draws one 
line in the middle of the sacrificial surface from south to north 
and from this line only three lines are drawn upwards, one to 
the south of it, one in the middle, and one to the north ( i. eÂ» 
there are only four lines and not six as in Asvalayana). 
Further it ( I. 8. 6-7 ) says that the seat of the brahmS priest is 
to the south of the sthandila and he is honoured with flowers. 
Sankhayana adds ( L 8. 8. ) the detail that the pranltS waters 
are carried forward on the north side and ( I. 8. 9-11 ) that 
paristarana follows after the carrying forward of the pranlta 
waters. It also adds ( I. 8. 24-25 ) that waters in the sruva 
spoon are purified just as ajya is purified and then a portion of 
the water in the sruva is poured on to the pranlta water and the 
rest of the water in the sruva is called the proksanl water with 
which the f havis, the idhma ( fuel ) and barhis ( kusas ) are 
sprinkled. Sankhayana I. 9. 1 lays down that sruva spoon is 
the vessel in all grhya rites ( and not juhu as in 6rauta rites ) 
except where a special rule to the contrary is stated. The 
Pfir. gr. I. 1 ( S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 269-270 ) and the Khadira gr. 
I. 2 ( S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 376-378 ) describe the model homa in a 
very concise manner. The Gobhila gr. (I. 1. 9-11, and I. 5. 
13-20, I. 7. 9, 1. 8. 21 ), Hir. gr. ( 1. 1. 9-L 3. 7 S. B. E. vol. 
30 pp. 138-145 ) describe it at great length. The sthandila 
should be prepared on a level spot or on a spot that slopes 
towards the east or north or north-east ( vide Hir. gr. 1. 1. 9, S. B. 
E. vol. 30, p. 133 ). The sthandila should be raised to the height 

484. In the grhya rites ordinarily no brahmS priest is present, but 
he is represented by a bundle of kuia grass ( 50 blade3 ). For qf^R - 
*r?T and ^*h vide respectively srr**. Â£. 1. 12. 7 and IV. 9. The deities

of two or four finger breadths or as much as the sand or loose

The brahma is the only priest ( out of the f oui ^ e pran ^ 

rtviks) in sacrifices that are offered in one fire ( n ^e gru J 
grhya fire) and are called pakayajftas and the k por *iiiaiia 
( sacrificer ) is himself the hotr priest. 486 The order of the 
several parts in the homa is as follows: 487 upalepana 
( smearing with cowdung ), arranging of sthandila with sand or 
earth ; drawing lines on the sthandila with a samidh (fuel stick), 
keeping the samidh on the lines with its end towards the east, 
sprinkling sthandila with water on its north or east, keeping the 
samidh ( with which lines were drawn ) outside the sthandila 
towards the north-east, then acamana ( by the sacrificer ), then 
placing fire ( either produced by attrition or brought from the 
house of a srotriya or the ordinary one ) on the sthandila facing 
the performer, placing two or three samidhs on the fire, keep- 
ing ready of idhma (15 samidhs) and a bunch of darbha grass. 
Then parisamuhana ( wiping the ground round the fire from 
north-east with the hand that has water in it ), then paristarana 
( strewing darbha grass round the altar first to the east, then to 
the south, then to the west and lastly to the north ), then silent

yana ( carrying forward the water to the north of the fire ) in a 
vessel of bell-metal or earthenware, then ajyotpavana ( purifica- 
tion of the clarified butter with two kuÂ§a blades as strainers 488 
thrice, once with mantra and twice silently ), the two Sgh&ras 
and the two oblations of ajya. Then the principal oblations as 
directed in the various sufcras, then finally an oblation to Agni 
Svistakrt. The method of offering an oblation is to repeat the 
mantra preceded by om and to add sv&ha at the end, to put the 
ahuti ( oblation ) on fire and to say ' this is for such and such 
a god and not mine \ 488 

The A6v. grhya-sutra ( I. 4 ) further adds that in caula, 
upanayana, godana and marriage there are ( as part of these 
ceremonies ) first four oblations of clarified butter to be made 
with the three mantras ( Rg. IX. 66. 10-12 ) ' Oh Angi, thou 
purifiest life &o ' and with the one verse * Prajapati ! no other 
than thou &c ' ( Rg. X. 121. 10) or with the vyahrtis, m or 

488. In some works pa"tra"sa"dana is taught after paristarana and 
paryuk8,ana ( Tide Narffyana on Hiv. gr. I. 3. 3. ). It consists in placing 
the several vessels to the north of the fire on darbha grass in pairs with 
both hands, the faces of the vessels being turned down. Then he takes 
two blades ( as described in Xiv. gr. I. 3. 4 ) as pavitras and plaoes them 
in the proks^auapStra the face of which is turned up and pours water in 
the proks,anapa"tra and thrice purifies the water with them, then the 
other vessels are turned upwards, the bundle of idhma is loosened and 
all vessels are sprinkled with water, then the pranlta"pa"tra is plaoed to 
the west of the fire, the two pavitras (kua'a blades used as strainers 
are placed inside it and water is poured into the pranita"pa"tra and 
sandalwood paste is mixed with it, the vessel is raised level with one's 
nose and placed to the north of the fire on darbhas, and oovered with 
darbhas. This is pa"tra"s5dana. NffrSyana mentions also other acts not 
specified by AdvalSyana which may be done even by a person following 
that sfltra viz. carrying a firebrand ( burning blade of darbha ) round 
the clarified butter and cleansing of Bruo and sruva, and throwing of the 
rope that tied together idhma into the fire at the end of the oblation 
to Sviftakrt.

according to some teachers with a combination ( of the rk verses 
and vyahrtis ), 490 while according to others there are no such 
special oblations. 491 

In modern times, after the sthandila is sprinkled with water, 
fire is established on it under various names depending on the 
rite to be performed e. g. in upanayana and marriage respec- 
tively the fire is called 492 ' Samudbhava ' and ' Yojaka \ Then 
fuel sticks already sprinkled with holy water are placed on the 
fire and it is fanned into a flame and prayer is offered to it in 
the words * agne VaiSvanara Sandilya mesadhvaja mama 
sammukho varado bhava*. Then follow parisamuhana and 
other acts stated above. 

Just as homa is required in most grhya rites there are 
certain matters common to almost all rites. One is that in all 
sarhskaras one has to feed .brahmanas learned in the Vedas. 498 
All rites begin with acamana by the performer, pranayama by 
him, reference to the deSa ( place ) and kala ( time ) and a samkcdpa 
( a declaration of what rite he is performing and for what 
purpose ). After these, according to medieval works, follow in 
all auspicious rites the worship of Ganapati, puny aha vacana , 
the worship of M5trs (mother goddessess) and NandlfirSddha . 
According to some there is only one sarhkalpa for all these ; 
according to others there is a separate sarhkalpa for each of 
puny&havacana, mStrkapujana and N&ndl&raddha. In all 
auspicious rites the performer takes a bath first, ties his topknot , 
has a piece of ground cowdunged and lines with coloured 
materials are drawn on a portion of the ground, two auspicious 
kalasas ( jars ) filled with water are placed on such ornamented 
ground with their mouths covered with a pot, all articles 
necessary for worship are placed to the north of the spot, two 

490. i. e. there will be eight oblations ( 4 with rks and 4 with 
vyBhrtis ). 

491. i. e. there are no oblations with the 4 verses nor with the 
four vyahrtis, but oblations will have to be offered to those deities that 
are prescribed as the deities where no special rule exists ( ride 5fl>. gr. 
1. 3. 8 set out above at p. 208 ). 

492. Vide #. *. ?rr. pp. 58-59 where these names of the fires in the 
several sarhskaras and rites are set out. The DanakriySkaumudi (pp. 
205-206 ) quotes from Kapila PancarStra over 80 names of the fires 
kindled in the several rites and ceremonies.

wooden low stools or planks are arranged to the west of the 
spot so decorated, the performer sits on one plank facing the 
east, his wife sits to his right and if the ceremony is meant for 
his son, the latter sits to the right of the wife ; the brahmanas 
are seated a little away to the right of the wife, facing the 
north and the performer sips water (takes acamana). Except 494 
where a religious rite is to be performed on a fixed day ( e. g, 
anniversary sraddha &o. ) all samskaras and other auspioious 
rites are to be performed at certain auspicious times only.

The well-known mantra ( 4 gananam tva ganapatim havamahe' 
Kg. II* 23. 1 ) which is used to invoke Ganeda is addressed to 
Brahmanaspati. Indra is addressed as Ganapati in Rg. X. 112. 
9. In the Tai. S. IV. 1. 2. 2 and Vaj. S. paSus ( and the horse 
specially ) are said to be the Ganapatya of Rudra. The Ait, 
Br. IV. 4 495 expressly says that the mantra 4 gananam tva ' 
is addressed to Brahmanaspati. In the Vaj. S. 16. 25 we have 
the plural ( GanapatibhyaSca vo namo ' ) and in 22. 30 we have 
the singular * Ganapataye svaha \ The peculiar features of 
Ganesa as described in the medieval works, viz. the head of an 
elephant, pot belly, mouse as vahana ( conveyance ) are entirely 
wanting in the Vedic literature. In Vaj. S. III. -57 the mouse 4M 
is said to be the paSu ( animal to be offered to ) of Rudra. In 
the Tai. Ar. (X. 15 ) there is a verse 497 * We contemplate 
Vakratunda, therefore may the tusked ( god ) impel us \ In the 
Grhya and Dharma sutras there is no reference to the worship 
of Gane&a at the beginning of all auspicious rites. That is 
comparatively a later cult. In the Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 5. 83-90, 
S. B. E. vol. 14. p. 254 ) the Devatarpana inoludes the propitia- 
tion of Vighna, Vinayaka, Vlra, Sthula, Varada, Hastimukha,

Vakratunda, Ekadanta and Lambodara. But this part of the 
Baud, Dh. S. is of doubtful authenticity. All the above are the 
appellations of Vinayaka (vide Baud. grhya-sesasutra III. 10. 6 ). 
In the Manaya grhya II. 14 it is said that the Vinayakas are 
four viz. Salakatankata, Kusmandarajaputra, Usmita and 
Devayajana. They are evil spirits and people when seized 
by them have bad dreams and see in them inauspicious sights 
such as shaved persons, persons with matted hair or wearing 
yellowish garments, camels, hogs, asses, candalas. When 
seized by them, princes, though capable, do not get their king- 
doms ; maidens, though endowed with all accomplishments, 
cannot secure husbands; married women have no children or 
even virtuous wives lose their children in infancy ; husbandmen 
lose their crops &c. The Manavagrhya then prescribes propi- 
tiatory rites to remove the effects of Vinayaka seizure. The 
Baijav&pagrhya (quoted by Apararka p. 563 on Yaj. I. 275) says 498 
that there are four Vinayakas, Mita, Sammifca, Salakatankata 
and Kusmandarajaputra and describes seizure by them and its 
effects in the same way as the Manavagrhya. These two 
show the first stage in the development of the cult of Vinayaka. 
Vinayakas are at this stage malevolent spirits who cause 
dangers and obstacles of various kinds. In this cult various 
elements from the terrific aspects of Rudra were probably first 
drawn upon and amalgamated with other elements drawn from 
aboriginal cults. The next stage is indicated by the Yaj. smrti 
( I. 271-294 ). Here Vinayaka ( I. 271 ) is said to be one appoin- 
ted by Brahma and Rudra to the over-lordship of the Ganas, he 
is represented not only as causing obstacles, but also as bring- 
ing success in the actions and rites undertaken by men. Yaj, 
enumerates the results of the seizure by Vinayaka in the 
same way as the Manavagrhya. Yaj. I 285 says that Mita, 
Sammita, Salakatankata and Kusmandarajaputra are the 
four names 4 " of the one Vinayaka and that Ambikft is the 
mother of Vinayaka. It is noteworthy that Yaj. does not

499. Though VidvarUpa and AparSrka take these to bo four, it is 
curious that the Mit. makes them to be six ( viz. Sffla and Katanka|;a as 
distinct and so also KQ^mSnda and RKjaputra). It is remarkable that 
Ksjira on Amarakoda expressly says that Heramba is a Desya word. Tbii 
adds some weight to the theory that Ganeda was taken over into the 
Vedic pantheon from some exotio tribe and affiliated to Rudra ( 6iya ).

employ any one of the well-known epithets of Vinayaka, viz. 
Ekadanta, Heramba, Qajanana, Lambodara &c. The Baud, 
gr. 6e$asutra III. 10 prescribes a somewhat different prooedure 
for propitiating Vinayaka and styles him ' the lord of bhiitas ', 
and also ' hastimukha * and ' vighneÂ§vara ' and prescribes the 
offerings of apupa and modaka to him. Thus Baudhayana is 
nearer to the medieval conception of GaneSa than even Yajfia- 
valkya. The Adiparva makes Gane6a write the Mahabharata 
to the dictation of Vyasa ; but this part is apocryphal as many 
mss. altogether omit this episode ( vide J. R. A. S. for 1898 
pp. 380-384, Winternitz ). The other references in Vanaparva 
65. 23 and Anusasana 150. 25 bear affinity to the description 
of Vinayaka in the Manavagrhya. 50 Â° 

The Gobhilasmrti (in verse) 1. 13 prescribes that at the begin- 
ning of all rites, the Matrs together with Ganadhipa (the lord of 
Ganas ) should be worshipped. The well-known characteristics 
of Gane&a and his worship had become fixed before the 5th oi 
6th century of the Christian era. Kalidasa does not refer to 
GaneSa. The Gathasaptasafcl has references to Gane&a. In thai 
work (IV. 72) an image of Ganesa is referred to as made use of 
as a pillow and the tip of his trunk is mentioned in V. 3. In 
Codrington's ' Ancient India ' plate XXXIX there is an image 
of Gape6a referable to about 500 A. D, Vide Dr. Bhandarkai 
in ' Vaisnavism and Sairism ' p. 147. Bana in his Harsacarita 
( IV Ucohvasa verse 2 ) speaks of the large tusk of Ganadhip* 
and in describing Bhairavacarya ( Harsacarifca III ) associate! 
Vinayaka with obstacles and learning and also indicate* 
that he had the head of an elephant. In the Vamanapurane 
(chap. 54) there is a fantastic legend about the birth ol 
Vinayaka. 

The Mahavlracarita ( II. 38 ) speaks of the tusk of Heramba 
The Matsyapurana ( chap. 260. 52-55 ) describes how the imagei 
of Vinayaka are to be made. Apararka ( p. 343 ) quotes a pass 
age from the Matsyapurana ( 289.7 ) on the mahadana callec 
Mahabhutaghata, in whioh it is said that Vinayaka should bi 
shown as riding a mouse. The Xrtyaratnakara p. 271 quotes * 
passage from the Bhavisyapurana for the worship of Ganesa or 
the 4th day of Bhadrapada. Vide Agnipurana chap. 71 and 313

In modern times a verse 501 is repeated in whioh the shrines of 
the eight Vinayakas in the Decoan are enumerated. 

Among the earliest epigraphic references to Ganapati is the 
one in the Nidhanpur plate of Bhaskarvarman ( middle of 7fch 
century ). Vide E. L Vol. XII. p. 73. 508 

The Ganapatipujana consists in the performer repeating 
the mantra Rg. II. 23. 1 ( * ganSnam tva Gariapatim ' ) as a 
prayer and then bowing to Gane6a with the words * Om MahS- 
ganapataye namo namah nirvighnam kuru ' ( salutations to the 
great Ganapati, make ( this rite ) free from obstacles \ 

Punyahavacana : â Although many elaborate descriptions of 
this are given in later digests like the Samskararatnamala, 
this was originally in ancient times a very simple and brief 
rite. The Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 4. 13. 8 ) says that in ordinary life in 
all auspicious rites ( such as marriage ) all sentences begin with 
* Om f as in saying * punyaham \ * svasti \ and ' rddhim 9 . The 
performer of a religious rite honours the assembled brahmanas 
with gandha ( sandalwood paste ), flowers and tambula ( betel 
leaves ) and requests with folded hands 'may you declare the 
day to be auspicious for such and such a ceremony which I, by 
name so and so, am 502 about to perform ' and then the brahmanas

three sentenoes ( with svasti, punyaham and rddhim ) is to be

of Yama says that the brahmanas should respond without the 
syllable * om * when the performer of the rite is a ksatriya or a 
vaisya. 

Matrkapuwna : â The Matrs ( the Mother Goddesses ) do not 
figure in the sutras. But that their worship was prevalent 
certainly in the first centuries of the Christian era throughout 
India can be proved from several sources. In the drama 
Mrcchakatika (I) Carudatta asks his friend Maitreya to offer 
bait to the Matrs. The Gobhila-smrti 504 ( in verse 1. 11-12 ) names 
14 matrs viz. Gaurl, Padma, Sad, Medha, Savitrl, Vijaya, JayS, 
Devasena, Svadha, Svaha, Dhrti, Pusti, Tusti and one's own deity 
( abhls^a-devata ). In the Markandeya ( chap. 88. 11-20 and 38 ) 
seven matrs have been named as Matrgana. The Matsyapurana 
( chap. 179. 9-32 ) names over a hundred mother goddesses (like 
MaheSvarl, Brahml, Kaumari, Camunda ), while in chap. 261 
( 24-36 ), there is a description of the images of some of the matrs 
like Brahmanl &c. The Brhat-Samhita of Varahamihira (chap. 58 # 
56 ) refers to the images of the mother goddesses. Bana in his Ka- 
dambarl frequently refers to the matrs, to their worship and to dila- 
pidated temples'of these goddesses. 505 The Krtyaratnakara quotes 
a passage from the Bhavisyapurana at p. 261 about the images of 
the seven matrs and pp. 305 and 307 quote the Devlpurana about 
the worship of matrs and the flowers dear to them. The worship 
of matrs is mentioned in the Bihar Stone Pillar Inscription of 
Skandagupta ( Gupta Inscriptions pp. 47, 49 ). The Calukyas 
are often described as ' cherished by the seven matrs * (LA. vol. 
VI. p. 73 in 535 sake and E. L vol. IX. p. 100 in 660 A. D. ). 
The Kadambas are described as meditating on Kartikeya-SvamI 
and on the group of matrs ( I. A. vol. VI. p. 25 ) 506 . Similarly a

temple to the Mates is said to have been ereoted by MayHr&ksa, 
the minister of ViSvavarman in 480 of the Malava Era i. e. 
423-24 A. D. ( Gupta Inscriptions p. 74 ). 

Whence the cult of matrs, which was not described in the 
Grhyasutras, was derived it is diffioult to say. Sir John Mar- 
shall in his famous work on Mohenjo-Daro ( vol. I. p. VII and 
pp. 49-52 and plates XII, XOIV and XOV ) shows how figurines 
of mother goddesses are common at Mohenjo-Daro. That shows 
that the cult prevailed in the remotest antiquity and was 
probably taken up by the followers of the Vedic religion and 
affiliated to the worship of Durga, the spouse of Siva. In 5g. 
IX 102. 4 507 the seven mothers are said to regulate soma when 
it is being prepared ( the seven mothers are probably the seven 
metres or the seven rivers ). 

Nandiiraddka : â This will be dealt with under Sraddhas 
later on. 

Pufnsavana : â This rite is so called because in virtue of it a 
male is born. 508 The word 'pumsuvana' occurs in the Afcharva- 
veda VI. 11. 1 where 509 it appears to be used literally ( in the 
sense of * giving birth to a male child ' ) * The Asvattha tree is 
on top of the SamI tree, there the birfch of a male has been 
effected*. The AÂ§v. gr. 1. 13. 2-7 describes the rite as follows: 
' he should in the third month of pregnancy, under the constel- 
lation Tisya ( i. e. Pusya ) give ( thrice ) to eat to the wife, 
after she has fasted, ( on the preceding Punarvasu constellation ) 
in the curds of a cow which has a calf of the same colour (wifch 
the cow ) two beans and one grain of barley for each handful 
of curds. On his asking ( the woman ) * what dost thou drink ? 
what dost thou drink ? \ she should thrice' reply ' pumsavana \ 
(generation of a male), * pumsavana'. In this way (he) 
should make her take three handfuls ( of curds with two beans 
and barley )/ M0 

There is some difference of view as to details. The Ap. gr.,

nayana and Ap. gays it may be performed when pregnancy 
becomes apparent Instead of two beans and a barley 511 grain in 
curds, he requires the bringing of a shoot of the branch of a 
nyagrodha tree which ( tree ) points eastward or northward and 
which has two ( fruits that look like ) testicles and the pounding 
of the shoot and fruits by a girl who has not attained puberty 
between two upper stones of ( two mills ) with water. He then 
prescribes that the wife should lie down on her back to the west 
of the fire herself facing the east and that the husband should 
insert in her right nostril the pounded substance with his thumb 
with the formula (pumsavanam-asi) found in Ap. M. P. (II. 11. 14). 
San. gr. ( I. 20, S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 46 ) says that the rite may 
be performed on Tisya or Sravana, while the Bharadvaja gr. 
( I. 22 ) says that it may be performed on Tisya or Hasta or 
Anuradha or Uttara or Prosthapada ; Paraskara and Baijavapa 
say it should be performed when the moon is in conjunction 
wifch a male naksatra. 512 Par. gr. 1. 14 and Jatukarnya (Sam.Pr. 
p. 167 ) and Baijavapa ( ibid. ) say that the rite should be per- 
formed in the 2nd or 3rd month of pregnancy, Asv., Hir., San., 
Gobhila, Khadira prescribe the third month. Ysj. I. 11, Par. 
gr. ( I. 14 ), Visnu Dh. S. 27. 2 and Brhaspati ( quoted in the 
Sin. C. ) say that pumsavana should be performed before the 
foetus begins to move or throb in the worab. In the Ka^haka 
gr. 32. 2 the proper time is said to be when the greater number 
of months of pregnancy are past ( i. e. after the 5th ) and the 
Manava gr. says that it should be performed in the 8th month 
of pregnancy. Devapala ( com. of Kathaka gr. ) says the usage 

511. NarSyana says that in this rite one has to perform at first the 
sthalipaka intended for Prajffpati up to the offering of the two Sjya- 
bhffgas and then one should perform what is specially prescribed here. 
He further notes that the curds may be of a cow the calf of which is of 
a different colour, if one of the same colour could not be had. The 
curds are to be poured from the vessel of curds on to the woman's hand 
thrice, she is to lick the curds every time with two boans and a grain of 
barley ; the beans and barley grain aro suggestivo. This is made clear

of Sistas is to perform it in the 8th month and Brahmabala 
( another com. ) says that the usage is to perform it in the 7th or 
8th month of pregnancy. Most of the grhyasutras refer to the 
pounding of the shoot 513 of the Nyagrodha tree (or some other plant) 
and inserting the pounded substance in the wife's right nostril. 
The mantras repeated when inserting the substance in her nostril 
are different according to most satras. Sankhayana (S. B.E. 
vol. 29, p. 46) prescribes the four verses Rg. I. 1. 3, III. 4. 9., V. 37 . 
2 and IX 3. 9. with svaha at the end of each verse. Paraskara 
( S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 292) prescribes Vaj. S. XIII. 4 ( Rg. X. 121. 1 ) 
and XXXI. 17; Khadira gr. ( S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 394) mentions 
Mantra-Brahmana I. 4. 8, the Kanaka gr. quotes Kathaka 
Sarhhita. The several sutras of the Black Yajurveda show the 
greatest divergence among themselves. 

It would be clear that the pumsavana rite has several 
elements, religious (homa and son's importance from ancient 
times), symbolical or suggestive (the drinking of curds with 
beans and grain of barley ) and medical ( inserting some 
substance in the woman's nostrils). For what purpose the 
placing of the v bile of a tortoise on the woman's lap was 
prescribed by Paraskara alone ( 1. 14 ) it is difficult to say. 

Later works like the Samskararatnamala prescribe a homa 
for pumsavana also and remark that when in the absence of the 
husband, the husband's brother or other relative performs the 
rite, it should be performed in ordinary kitchen fire ( p. 815 ). 
This latter rule applies to Slmantonnayana also. 

Anavcdobhana or Garbharaksaya : â This rite was apparently 
part of Pumsavana. Asv. gr., as already said, separately men- 
tions pumsavana and anavalobhana as referred to in the 
Upanisad. The Baijavapa gr, ( quoted in the Sarhskarapra- 
kasa p.171) says 'He performs the pumsavana and anavalobhana 
in the fortnight of the waxing moon on an auspicious day when 
the moon is in conjunction with a naksatra ( deemed to be ) a 
male \ This shows that both were performed on the same day. 
Another sutra of Baijavapa quoted in the Samskaramayukha 5M 
says that the two are to be performed in the 2nd or 3rd month 

513. According to the KStbaka gr. the pounding is to be done by a 
virgin or a brahmacarin or by a chaste brShinana woman.

of pregnancy. This rite is so called because by virtue of its 
performance the f oecus does not fall out or is not destroyed (i. e. 
it is really anavalopana from the root lup with ava ). AS v. gr. 
( I. 13. 5-7 ) describes it as follows : He then inserts in her right 
nostril in the shade of a round apartment the ( sap ) of an herb 
which is not faded ; 515 according to some ( teachers ), with the 
Prajavat and Jivaputra mantras. Having offered a sacrifice of 
cooked food to Prajapati he should touch the region of her heart 
with the verse 4 Oh thou whose hair is well parted, what is 
hidden in thy heart, in Prajapati, that I understand, ( mayst 
thou understand ) me who know that; may not injury to the 
son be my lot \ 

It will be seen that the inserting of durvarasa in the woman's 
nostril, touching her heart and prayers to the gods for the safety 
of the foetus are the principal features of this rite in Asv, 

According to Saunaka-karika ( Ms. in Bombay University 
Library, folio 13a ) that rite is called anavalobhana whereby the 
foetus remains undisturbed or does not fall out. 516 According 
to the Smrtyarthasara it is to be performed in the fourth month. 
According to Laghu-A6valayana IV. 1-2 anavalobhana and 
slmantonnayana were to be performed in the 4th, 6th or 
8th month of pregnancy and verses 6-7 give the same details 
as in Asv. gr. 

The feii. gr. ( I. 21. 1-3, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 47 ) speaks of 
a ceremony called Garbharaksana ( protection of the foetus ) : 
" In the fourth month the garbharaksana; offering six oblations 
into fire from a mess of cooked food with the six verses of the 
hymn ' brahmanagnih ' 517 ( Rg. X. 162 ) with svaha uttered at 
the end of each verse, with the verges 4 from thy eyes, thy nose ' 
( Rg. X, 163. 1-6 ), besmearing her limbs with clarified butter at 
each verse. " 

515. NaTSyana explains that the herb is dSrva" according to usage. 
The flap is put in the nostril silently or to the accompaniment of two 
mantras, which are respectively of the sage Praja"vat and Jivaputra.

This seems to be another version of anavalobhana. 

According to A&v. gr. karikas of Kumarila (I. 6. 5 ) this 
rite is to be repeated on every conception. Most other writers 
would hold that like pumsavana it is to be performed only once. 

Simantonnayana : â This is treated in the following gr. 
sutras : Asiv. I. 14. 1-9; San. I. 22, Ap. 14. 1-8, Hir. II. 1, Baud- 
I. 10, BhSradvaja I. 21, Gobhila II. 7. 1-12, Khadira II. 2. 24-28, 
Par. 1. 15, Kathaka 31. 1-5, Vaikhanasa III. 12. 

This word literally means * parting of the hair ( of a woman ) 
upwards,' Yaj. ( 1. 11 ), Veda-Vyasa ( 1. 18 ) call this sarhskara 
simply * slmanta', while Gobhila ( II. 7. 1 ), Manava gr. (1. 12. 2), 
Kathaka gr ( 31. 1 ) call it slmantakarana. Ap. gr. and Bhara- 
dvaja gr. ( I. 21 ) describe it before pumsavana. The 5iv. gr. 
( 1. 14. 1-9 ) desoribes it as follows : " In the fourth month of 
pregnancy the Simantonnayana ( should be performed ). In the 
fortnight of the waxing moon,when the moon may be in conjunc- 
tion with a naksatra that is ( regarded as ) male ( or the name 
of which is of the masculine gender, according to NSrayana ) ; 
then he establishes fire ( i. e. performs the details of homa up 
to offering of ajyabhagas ) and having spread to the west of the 
fire a bull's hide with its neck to the east and the hair outside, 
he makes eight oblations ( of ajya, clarified butter ), while his 
wife sits on it ( hide ) and takes hold ( of his hand ), with the 
two ( verses) ' may Dhatr give to his worshipper ' ( Atharvaveda 
VII. 17. 2-3 ), with the two verses, 'I invoke Raka' ( Rg. II. 32. 
4-5 ), with the three (verses) called 'nejamesa' ( a khilasukta 
after ftg. X. 184 and Ap. M. P. 1. 12. 7-9 ) and with the verse * Oh 
Prajapati, no one other than you ' ( Rg. X. 121. 10 ). He then three 
times parts her hair upwards ( beginning from the front and pro- 
ceeding backwards ) with a bunch of an even number of unripe 
fruits with a porcupine quill that has three white spots 518 ( or 
rings ) and with three bunches of ku&a grass, with the words 
* bhur, bhuvah, svar, om ' or he does so four times. He gives 
orders to two lute players * sing ( praise of ) king soma. ' ( They 
sing this gatha ) * may soma, our king, bless the human race. 

518. The porcupine quill with throe white spots is mentioned 
even in the Tai. Br. as an auspicious thing. * He should shave his head 
with a porcupine quill with three white spots since in the case of the 
gods three are auspicious things, viz. the three metres, the three 
savanas, these three worlds ( I. 5. 6. ) * ^<nrr sra^TT forcfft g Â« sfiVft Â§ %*r-

Fixed is the wheel ( dominion ) of this ( river ) ; ( here they take 
the name in the vocative ) of the river near which they dwell. 
And let them do whatever aged brahmana women whose hus- 
bands and children are alive direct. A bull is the fee ( for the 
sacrifice)". In the Ap. mantrapa^ha thirteen verses are 
devoted to this samskara in all, some of which occur in the Rg ., 
the Atharvaveda and Tai. S. 

We have here first the religious part of homa and oblations 
with mantras. But this rite is mainly of a social and festival 
nature intended to keep the pregnant woman in good cheer. 
The Samskaraprakasa ( pp. 172-173 ) quotes some verses from 
an 5ival5yana stating that this rite serves the purpose of 
driving certain female goblins that thirst for the destruction of 
the foetus ; the parting of the hair by the husband with the 
quill, bunch of unripe fruits and darbhas and tying a garland 
round her neck, giving her boiled rice mixed with mudga and 
ghee and asking lute players to sing indicate its festive 
character. There is a great divergence among the grhya sutras 
about the several details of this samskara and the order in 
which they take place. The Sm. 0. after pointing out a few 
divergences remarks that one should follow the rules of one's 
own grhya sufcra. A few important divergences are pointed out 
below. This samskara was to be performed in the 3rd month 
according to Kanaka gr. f in 3rd, 6th or 8th according to the 
Manava ; in the 4th month according to Asv., Ap., Hir. ( II. 1 ), 
in 4th or 6th according to Gobhila (II. 7. 2) and in the 4th, 6fch or 
8th according to Khadira, in 6th or 8th according to Paraskara, 
Yaj. (I. 11), Visnu Dh. S. (27. 3), Sankha; in the 7th 
according to San. gr, ( I. 22. 1 ), in the 8th according to 
Vaik. and Veda-Vyasa ( I. 18 ). Sankha as quoted m the 
Smrticandrika ( I. p. 17 ) says that it should be performed on 
the foetus beginning to move and up to the time of delivery. 
Â£6v M San, and Hir. require that the moon must be in conjunc- 
tion with a male naksatra. Hir. gr. alone prescribes that the 
samskara should take place in a round apartment. It is remark- 
able that A6v. alone requires that the woman should be seated 
on a bull's hide, which shows that till his day such a hide was 
not treated ( as is done in modern times ) as a very unholy 
thing. Paraskara makes her sit on a soft chair or seat, while* 
Gobhila prescribes a seat of northward pointed darbhas. There 
is great divergence as to the number of oblations and the verses 
to be repeated even in sutras of the same Veda, e. g. ASva- 
lftyana prescribes eight oblations and eight mantras, but 



224 History of Dharmaidstra [ Ch. VI 

SSnkhayana prescribes only six ( by omitting the verses Rg. 
II. 32. 4-5 ). Gobhila, Khadira, Bharadvaja, Paraskara and 
Sankhayana prescribe the preparation of boiled rice with 
ghee thereon or sesame and the first three of these say that 
the woman should be asked to look at the ghee on the mass of 
rice and be questioned * what do you see ' and she should be made 
to reply ' I see progeny ' ( Bharadvaja has the reply ' sons and 
cattle'). Almost all grhya sutras agree that in parting the 
hair the husband is to use a bunch of unripe fruit (Gobhila, 
Par. and San. specifying that it was to be Udumbara fruit), a 
porcupine quill with three white- spots and three bunches of 
ku6a grass. Paraskara and Gobhila add the use of a Vlratara 
stick and a full spindle. Some like Asv. prescribe that the 
parting must be done thrice, Gobhila seems to prescribe it six 
times, while Khadira ( II. 2. 25 ) expressly says that it is to be 
done only once. San. says that the unripe fruits are to be tied 
to a string of three twisted threads and the string is to be sus- 
pended from her neck as a garland. Par. also seems to suggest 
the same. Ap. also says that the husband should ( by way of 
ornament ) tie a string of barley grains with young shoots on 
the woman's head ( 14. 7 ) and Vaikhanasa says that the woman 
is to wear a garland and have fragrant unguents applied to her 
body. Many of the grhya sutras direct that lute players should 
sing a verse or verses. Gobhila, Khadira, Vaik. are silent on 
this point, but Gobhila prescribes that brahmana women should 
address auspicious words to her * Be you the mother of a valiant 
son.' There is divergence as to whose praise is to be sung. 
San and Par. say that the ballad sung must be in praise of the 
( ruling ) king or any one else who is very valiant. Asv., Hir., 
Baud., Bharadvaja and Par. prescribe a gatha in honour of king 
Soma ( the plant ). Apastamba refers to two verses, one of 
which praises king Yaugandhari and the other king Soma and 
prescribes that the first is to be sung for all varnas residing in 
the Salva countries, while the second is to be recited by 
brahmanas. Some of the sutras like Asv., Par., Bharadvaja 
allow that in the ballad to be sung by the lute players the river 
on which the woman and her husband dwell is to be invoked. 519

Asv. and San. expressly state thai; a bull is the fee in this 
eamskara for the officiating priest Apâ Par. and Bharadvaja 
say that brahmanas are to be fed in this rite. San. says that 
the woman is to sing merrily and wear gold ornaments if she 
likes. The A.p. and Bharadvaja gr. say that tho husband is 
to observe silence that day till the stars begin to appear and 
then after going out of the house from the east or north, he 
should first touch a calf and then mutter the vyahrtis ( bhuh, 
bhuvah, svah ) and give up his silence. 580 

The Manavagrhya ( 1. 12. 2 ) speaks of parting of hair in 
the marriage rite also. Laghu-Asvalayana (IV. verses 8-16) 
gives a faithful summary of the Asv. gr.

banks of tho Jumna and the BhSradraja gr on the Ganges. Haradatta 
explaining 5p gr. says that the country of Salva is on the Jumna and 
that Vaidyas are in abundance there. The country of Salva was included 
in the Kaccbadigana < Pffnini V. 2. 133, and MabSbhSsya, vol. II. p. 
300). Pffnini mentions Salva in IV. 1.173, IV. 2.135 and teaches the 
formation of Yaugandhara in IV. 2. 130 and of Yaugandhari in IV. 1. 
173. In the Vanaparva 14. 1-5 it is said that the king of Salva whose 
capital was at Saubha attacked Dvaraka. &&lyaparva ( 20. 1 ) calls the 
Salva king lord of mleccha tribes and speaks of him as fighting for 
Duryodhana and as killed by Satyaki. A Karika quoted by the Kas'ika 
makes Yaugandhara a division of Salva * 3"]g**mT%R7*a'c?T U4'*KI 31WI": â

the performer (karts) is the husband ; even in the 7th sutra grammar 
requires that if the karta of tying the garland ('abadhya') is the 
husband then the karts of * visrjet* also must be the husband. Sudarfona 
notes (in his com. ) that some read the sUtras as * ^i^r *l*sM s*T srsHfar:...

silence. He also notes that according to some the actions from tying 
the yava onwards spoken of by Ap. are done by the wife herself and 
not by the husband.

Apastamba, Baud., Bharadvaja and Par. expressly say 
that this samskara is to be performed only once at the first 
conception. For the difference of view among nibandhakaras 
vide above ( pp. 205-206 ) on garbhadhana. 

Visnu was of opinion that shnantonnayana is a samskara 
of the woman, but that according to some it is a samskara of 
the foetus and so was to be repeated at each conception. 521 On 
account of the great divergence of details one may conjecture 
that this samskara was not very ancient in the times of the 
Grhyasutras. 

It appears however that gradually this picturesque rite 
receded in the back ground, so much so that Manu does not 
even mention it by name, though Yaj. names it. In modern 
times in Western India some people perform a rite in the 8th 
month of pregnancy ( called in Marathi Athahgulem ) which 
retains some vestiges of the ancient rite ( such as the garland 
of udurabara fruit ). 

Visnubali :â According to Vasistha quoted in the Sarhskara- 
prakasa ( p. 178 ) this ceremony was to be performed in the 8th 
month of pregnancy, on the 2nd, 7ch or VZi\xtitfd of the bright 
fortnight and when the moon was in the Sravana, RohinI or 
Pusya constellation. The same work quotes verses of AsvalS- 
y ana describing the ceremony and stating its purpose viz. to 
remove harm to the foetus and for easy delivery of the woman 
and that it was to ba performed during every conception. On 
the preceding day Nandlsraddha was to be performed and then 
homa to fire was to be performed up to the offering of ajyabhagas. 
To the south of the fire another sthandila of the shape of a lotus 
or svastika was to be drawn on which 64 oblations of boiled 
rice with ghee thereon were to be offered to Visnu ( some offer 
them on the fire itself ) with the verses of Rg. I. 22. 16-21, 
Rg. 1. 154. 1-6, Rg, VI. 69. 1-8, Rg. VII. 104. 11, Rg. X. 90, 1-16, 
Rg. X. 184. 1-3. Then to the north-east of the fire, a square 
plot should be smeared with cowdung and be divided into 64 squ- 
ares with white dust and 64 offerings of boiled rice should be offer- 
ed with the same mantras and in their midst one ball of rice 
should be offered to Visnu with the mantra loudly uttered ' namo

NarayanSya ' and the husband and wife should partake separa- 
tely of two balls of the same rice. Then the offering to Agni Svi- 
stakrt should be made, daksina should be distributed and brah- 
manas should be fed. The Vaik. ( III. 13 ) describes Visnubali 
differently. The gods with Agni as the first are invoked unto the 
northern pranidhi vessel and then at the end Purusa is invoked 
four times with * om bhuh \ * om bhuvah, ' * om suvah,* * ona 
bhur-bhuvah-suvah \ then to the east of the fire he invokes 
Visnu on seats of darbha grass with the names, Ke6ava, 
Naray ana, Madhava, Govinda, Visnu , Madhusudana, Tri vikraraa, 
Vamana, Srldhara, Hrslke^a, Padmanabha, Damodara ; then he 
bathes Visnu, with mantras 'ApaV (Tai. S. IV. 1. 5. 11 =Rg. X. 9. 
1-3 ), 'Hiranyavarnah' (Tai. S. V. 6. 1) and the chapter boginning 
â¢pavamanah* (TaLBr. I. 4. 8); he doss worship (with sandal 
paste, flowers &c. } by each of Visnu's twelve names, then he 
offers 12 oblations of clarified butter with the mantras * ato deva ' 
( Rg. I. 22. 16-21 ), ' Visnor-nu kam ' ( Rg. I 154. 1-7 = Tai. S. I. 2. 
13), * tad-asya priyam ' ( Tai. Br. II. 4. 6 = Rg. I 154. 5 ), * pra 
tadvisnuh ' ( Tai. Br. II. 4. 3 = Rg. I. 154. 2 ), * paro matraya ' 
( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3 ), ' vicakrame trir-devah ' ( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3 ). 
Then he announcces as offering a mess of rice cooked in milk on 
which ajya has been poured to the god and sacrifices it to him 
with the twelve names repeating the twelve mantras ( Rg. I. 22. 
16-21, and Rg. I. 154. 1-6). Having praised the god with 
mantras from the four vedas he should prostrate himself before 
the god after taking twelve names with the word * namah ' at the 
end of each ( i. e. by saying * Kesavaya namah* &o. ). What 
remains of the rica cooked in milk is eaten by the wife. 

Sosyantikarma : â Vide Ap. gr. 14. 13-15 ; Hir. gr # II. 2. 8-

II 2. 29-30, Par. gr. 1. 16, Kathaka gr. 33. 1-3. This seems to be 
a very ancient rite. It means * a rite for a woman who is about 
to be delivered of a child \ Rg. V. 78. 7-9 givo the earliest 
indications of this rite. * Just as the wind moves a lake on all 
sides, so may the foetus move and come out, being ( now ) in the 
tenth month. Just as the wind, the forest and the sea are in 
movement, so mayst thou ( foetus ) that art ( now ) in the tenth 
month, come out together with the after-birth, may the male 
child having been sleeping ten months inside his mother, come 
out a living being, unharmed, from his mother, herself being 
alive/ Br. Up. VI. 4. 23 also refers to this rite " He sprinkles 
with water the woman who is about to be delivered ( with the 
mantras) 'just as the wind ... , may it come out with the 



228 History of Dharmainstra [ Oh. Vl 

after-birth ' ( same as Rg. V. 78. 7 except the last pada ). This is 
a pen 528 of Indra with a bolt and with a chamber for rest : oh 
Indra, leave it and come out; with the foetus and after-birth." 
j&p. gr. describes the ceremony as follows : ' Now is described the 
rite to secure a rapid delivery. With a cup that has not been dipped 
in water before he draws water in the direction of the current ( of 
a river or spring ); he places Tiiryantl plant at his wife's feet; he 
should then touch on the head (with both hands) the woman who 
is in child-birth with the verse ( Ap, mantra-patha II. 11. 15 ) t m 
should sprinkle her with the waters ( brought as above ) with the 
next three verses ( Ap. mantra-patha II. 11. 16-18 ). If the after - 
birth does not come out, he should pnrinkle her with the water

are slightly different from those of the Ap. M. P. Gobhila and 
Khadira are very brief and say that a noma with two oblations 
of clarified butter is to be performed with the verses of the 
Mantra-brahmana I 5. 6-7. Paraskara also speaks of the 
sprinkling of the woman with two verses of Vaj S. VIII. 28-29 
(the first being almost like Rg. V. 78.7) and prescribes the 
recital of Atharvaveda I. 11. 4 for the falling of the after-birth. 
Adityadarsana on Kathaka gr. ( 33. 1 ) remarks that this rite is 
not really a sarhskara and Devapala says that this is a rite 
which has a seen result ( while samskaras are deemed to have 
an unseen result). 

Jatakarma: â This appears to have been a rite of hoary 
antiquity. In the Tai. S. 525 II. 2. 5. 3-4 we read * one should

eon is bom (to a man) That son, for whom when born 

they perform this * isti \ does become pure, glorious, substantial 
in ( abundant ) food, full of vigour and possessed of cattle \ 
This shows that Vaisvanares^i was performed on the birth of a 
son. Jaimini ( IV. 3. 38 ) holds a discussion on this passage 
and establishes the conclusion that this isti is for the benefit of 
the son and not of the father and the bhasya of Sahara gives 
the further propositions that this is^i is to be performed after the 
jataJcarma rites are finished ( and not immediately at birth ) and 
that it is to be performed on a full moon day or a new moon day 
following ten days after birth. The Sat. Br. ( S. B. E. vol. 44 
p. 129 ) prescribes a certain rite before the navel string is cut 
u regarding a new born son let him say to five brShmanas 
before the navel string has been cut ' breathe over him in this 
way/ But if he should be unable to obtain them, he may even 
himself breathe over him while walking round him ". The 
Br. Up. I. 5. 2 contains the following interesting passage 826 
" when a boy is born they first make him lick clarified butter, 
and they make him take the breast ( of the mother ) after that.'* 
At the end of the Br. Up. ( VI. 4. 24-28 ) there is an elaborate 
description of the jatakarma. " When ( a son ) is born, having 
kindled the fire, having placed the son on one's lap, having 
poured curds mixed with ghee in a bell-metal vessel he offers 
oblations of the curds mixed with ghee with the mantras ' may 
I maintain a thousand, prospering in my house ; may there 
be no break with regard to progeny and cattle ; svaha 1 I offer 
to these in my mind my pranas, svaha! Whatever I have 
done in excess in my work or whatever I may have left defi- 
cient in this ( rite ), may the wise ( Agni ) ( called ) Svis^akrt 
make that well sacrificed and well offered for us, svaha I'. 
Then after bringing down his mouth up to the right ear 
of the son he should recite thrice the word 'speech' 5 * 7 , then 
having poured together curds, honey and clarified butter, 
he makes the (son) eat it by means of (a spoon of ) gold 
not covered with anything else with the mantras ' I place in thee 
bhuh, I place in thee bhuvah, I place in thee svah, I place in 

Â«r. I. 5.2. 

527. The idea of muttering * v5k ' thrice is that the father wishes 
that speech as manifested in the three Vedas may come to the boy in 
due course. Bhuli, bhuvah and avail represent the three Vedas or earth, 
air and heaven. 



280 History of Dharmaiaatra I Oh. YI 

thee bhur-bhuvah svah, I place in thee all '. Then he gives 
him ( the boy that is born ) a name with the words ' thou art 
the Veda \ That becomes his secret name. Then he hands the 
boy over to his mother and gives him the breast of the mother 
with the mantra ( Rg. I. 164. 49 ) ' Oh, SarasvatI I make that 
breast ready for being sucked, which lies on thy body, which 
engenders happiness, by which thou nourishest all blessings, 
which bestows gems, that wins wealth and is a generous donor*. 
Then he solemnly addresses the mother of the child with the 
following mantras ' Oh maitravarunl 528 ! Oh strong one ! thou 
art IJa, she ( the mother ) has given birth to a valiant ( boy ) ; 
mayst thou be endowed with valiant sons, since thou hast made 
us possessed of a valiant son. They say to him ( the newly 
born son) ' thou indeed excellest thy father, excellest thy grand- 
father ; he may attain the highest station by his prosperity, 
glory and spiritual eminence, who is born as a son of such a 
brShmana that knows this ". 

It will be clear from the above passages of the Br. Up. 
that the jatakarma rite contained the following parts: (1) homa 
of curds with gbrta to the accompaniment of mantras ; (2) repeat- 
ing in the child's right ear the word * speech' thrice; (3) 
making the child liok curds, honey and ghrta by means of a 
golden ladle ( or ring ) ; (4) addressing the child with a name 
which was to be his secret name ( namakarana ) ; (5) putting 
the child to the breast ; (6) addressing the mother with mantras. 
The Satapatha adds another detail viz. asking five brahmanas 
if available to breathe on the child ( from four quarters, east, 
south, west, north and one immediately above him ) or the 
father himself may do so. 

There is great divergence in the grhyasutras on the diffe* 
rent details that go to make up the jatakarma. Some give 
almost all the above seven details, while others omit some of 
them. The order of these components differs in the grhya- 
sutras and according to the Veda to which each sutra is attached 
the mantras differ. It would be impossible to give in a brief 
compass the details from all grhyasutras. Some description, 
however, of the details from important grhyasutras is given 
below :

The ceremony has to be performed by the very necessities 
of the case immediately after birth. But different sutras ex- 
press it in different ways, e. g. Aiv. I. 15. 2 says the rite should 
be done before any other person ( than the mother and nurse ) 
touches the child. Par. gr. ( 1. 16 ) says it is performed before 
the navel string is cut off. Gobhila ( II. 7. 17 ) and Kh&dira 
II. 2. 32 say that it is to be performed before the navel string 
is cut off and the breast is given to the child. 

In the Siv. gr. ( I. 15. 1-4 ) the ceremony is described as 
follows: "When a son has been born, he (the father) should 
before other persons touch him, give to the child to eat honey 
and olarified butter in which gold has been rubbed by means of 
a golden ( spoon ) with the verso * I give unto thee the Veda 
( wisdom or knowledge ) of honey and ghrfca, ( Veda ) which is 
produced by the god Savitr ( who urges on ) the bountiful ; may 
you have long life and may you live in this world for a hund- 
red autumns being protected by the gods \ Bringing near the 
child's two ears ( his mouth ) the father mutters medhajanana m 
' may god Savitr bestow on thee intelligence ; may the goddess 
SarasvatI bestow on thee intelligence and may the two gods 
ASvins wearing wreaths of lotus give to thee intelligence \ 5S0 
He touches the ( son's ) two shoulders ( with the mantra ) ' be a 
irtone, be an axe, be indestructible gold ; thou art indeed Veda, 
called son ; so live a hundred autumns' and (with the mantra ) 
' Oh Indra, bestow the best wealth * ( ^%. II. 21. 6 ) and 4 Oh 
Maghavan ( bountiful Indra ) ! m Oh ( Indra) partaker of rjlsa ! 
bestow on us' (Rg. III. 36. 10). And let them give him a name". 
The following sutras ( I. 15. 5-10 ) lay down rules about the 
name, which will be considered under Namakarana. 



629. Tbe vejsc is bo caUed because it was deemed to produce 
intelligence. 

530. Nffrffyana ( on My. gr. I. 15. 2 ) notes that some say that the 
mantra is muttered only once, when the mouth is brought near each ear 
one after another, others say that the mantra is recited twice. 

531. srsftq" is Soma from which the essence is taken away (i. o. 
dregs of Soma ). The com. NMyana &ays that as to these mantras (1) 
some hold that the three mantras should be repeated continuously, while 
tbe shouldeis are touched one after the other ; (2) others hold that the 
mantra s^pit *nr should be uttered when touching the right shoulder, 
while the two '%*% Sten^' and '3^ *nrp*r' should be uttered while 
touching the left ; (3) the three mantras should bo repeated together and 
the shoulders touched simultaneously. NSrSyaua prefers this last 
because the bb&>yaka"ra who went before did so. 



tSk History of Dharmaimra [ Oh. Vl 

It will be noticed that; out of the several components of the 
rite described in the Br. Up. and the Sat. Br., &bv. omits express 
mention of homa, of putting the child to the breast (stanad&na), 
the address to the mother ( matrabhimantrana ), and the brea- 
thing over the child by five brahmanas or the father. The San. 
gr. ( I. 24. 1-12 ) also omits homa, the stanadana and matrabhu 
mantrava, but refers to the father breathing over the new bom 
child thrice. Instead of ghrta and honey served with a golden 
spoon, San. prescribes mixing of curds, honey, ghrta and water or 
grinding together of rice and barley. It adds the tying of gold 
to a hempen string and fixing it on the right hand of the child 
till the mother gets up from child-bed. 

It will have been noticed that Asv. and 6an, both prescribe 
giving a secret name to the child on the day of birth and do not 
prescribe a separate Namakarana ceremony. San. gr. ( I. 24. 6 ) 
adds that a vyavaharika name may be given on the 10th day 
from birth. The Gobhila gr. (II. 7. 13-15) and Khadira gr. 
II. 2. 28-31 say that a secret name for the child that is to be 
born is to be uttered in the Sosyantl-karma. So Asv. probably 
carries on that tradition. 

We shall now take the several components of the rite and 
show how they are dealt with by the several grhyasutras. 

Homa : â This is prescribed by the Br. Up., the M&nava, 
the Kanaka gr. at the time of birth. The A6v. gr. parisista 
(1. 26) says that homa should be performed to Agni and other gods 
as stated above ; then the child should be made to eat honey and 
ghrta and then the offering be made to Agni. It is prescribed 
before birth ( in the Sosyantlkarma ) by Gobhila and Khadira. 
It is prescribed after the whole rite by Baud. gr. II. 1. 13. It is 
omitted by Asv. and San. The Par. gr. (1. 16), Hir. gr. f Bharadvaja 
gr. ( I. 26 ) say that the Aupasana ( i. e. grhya ) fire is taken 
away and a sutikagni set up ( which is also called Uttapanlya ) 5 * 8 
near the door of the lying-in chamber. The Vaik. ( III. 15 ) 
calls it jatakagni ( and also Uttapanlya ). These say that in 
this fire white mustard seed with_small grains of rice are offered 
at the time of birth and at the morning and evening twilights for 
ten days after birth with certain mantras. Ap. prescribes that 

532. The Sutikagni is prepared by placing the broken piece of a jar 
on the kitchen fireplace and heating it with tbe dried dung of a bull.

Ch. VI ] Safn&kUras- Jatakarma 233 

mustard seeds and rice chaff are to be offered in the fire when- 
ever any body enters the lying-in chamber for ten days. 

(2) Medhajanana :â Two meanings are given to this. This 
word does not occur in the Br. Up. But it speaks of muttering 
in the right ear of the boy the word ' vak ' thrice and making 
the boy lick from a golden spoon or ring curds, honey and 
ghrta. The first of these viz. muttering in the right ear of the 
boy some words or a mantra is called medhajanana in Asv. and 
San. ( L 24. 9 which prescribes ' vak ' ) ; wMle most of the other 
sutras viz. Vaik., Hir., Gobhila say that medhajanana is the 
action of making the child eat honey, ghee, curds or pounded 
barley and rice, to the accompaniment of mantras (like 
' bhilstvayi dadhSmi ' in Par. or * Bhur rcah ' as in VaikhSnasa, 
or * medham te devah ' as in Ap. ). The Baud. gr. ( II. 1. 7 ) 
prescribes the giving of curds, honey and ghrta ten times with 
each of the ten mantras ( Tai. Br. II. 5, 1 ) of the anuvaka 
beginning with *pr5no raksati visvam-ejat.' The Vaik. expressly 
says that the Vaca 883 plant, Pathya plant, gold, honey and clari- 
fied butter become medhajanana. Manu II. 29 seizes upon the 
making the child eat gold ( dust ), honey and clarified butter to 
the accompaniment of mantras as the central part of the rite. 
Later works like the Samskaramayukha regard this eating of 
honey and ghrta as the principal part of jatakarma. 584 

(3) AyuÂ§ya : â Some of the sutras speak of a rite called 
ftyusya in the jatakarma. This consists in muttering over the 
navel (as in Par. ) or in the right ear of the boy some mantra or 
mantras invoking the bestowal of long life on the boy. A6v. 
( vide p. 231 ) has such an invocation in conjunction with the 
eating of honey and ghrta. Bharadvaja also does the same. 
MSnava gr. prescribes the anuvaka ' Agne ayur-asi ' ( Ka^haka 
Sam. XI. 7 ) for 21 oblations ( this anuvaka is full of the word 
â¢ ayusmat ' )â¢ 

(4) Amsabhimarkana ( touching the child on the shoulder 
or shoulders ). Vide Aiv. above. Ap. begins his treatment with 
the direotion that the father touches the boy with the Vatsapra 
anuvaka. Par., Bharadvaja speak of touching the boy twice, 
once with Vatsapra anuvaka ( Vaj. S. XII. 18-29 or Tai. S. IV.

2. 2 ), and again with ' be a stone, be an axe * ( in Par. and with 
the mantra ' may he grow ' in Bhar. ). Some sutras like Sah. 
omit this. 

(5) Matrabhimantraria :â ( addressing the mother ). The 
mother is addressed by the father with the verse ' Thou art Ila 
&o ' ( vide Br. Up. above ), which occurs in Par. Many sutras 
omit this. Hir. has a different verse. 

(6) Pafica-brahmanasthapana : â We saw above that the 
Satapatha prescribes the breathing over the child by five brfth- 
manas or the father himself. Par. prescribes the same and 
gives an option ( the five brahmanas are to repeat in order from 
the east prana, vySna, apana, udana and eamana ). Sah. asks 
the father himself to breathe thrice over the boy with a verse 
referring to the three Vedas. Several sutras omit this. 

(7) Stana-pratidhana or stanapradana : â making the ohild 
take the breast. The Br. Up. and many of the sutras prescribe 
this, together with the recitation of a mantra or mantras e. g. 
Par. prescribes Vaj. S. 17. 87 and 38. 5 for the two breasts, Ap. 
and Bhar. prescribe Ap. mantrapatha II, 13. 2 only for the right 
breast ; Hir. and Vaik. prescribe the same verse for both. 

(8) Dehabhimantrava in (or-marsana): â touching the ground 
where the son is born and addressing the earth ( with one or 
two mantras ). Par,, Bhar., Ap., Hir. do this. 

(9) Namakaraw : â ( giving a name to the child ). The Br 
Up., Asv., Sah., Gobhila, Khadira and several others speak of 
giving a name to the boy on the day of birth. As v. (I. 15. 4 
and 10 ) prescribes the giving of two names on that date, one 
for common use ( for which he gives elaborate rules ) and the 
other a secret one which his parents only know till the boy's 
upanayana. Sah. reverses this and says the name for which 
similar elaborate rules are laid down by him is the secret name 
and a name for common use is to be given on the lQth day 
Ap. gr. ( 15. 2-3 and 8 ) says on the day of birth a name derived 
from the naksatra ( lunar mansion ) on which the boy is borr 
is given, which is the secret name and then on the 10th anothei 
name is to be given. According to Gobhila and Khadira a name 
is to be given in the Sosyantl-karma which is to be kept secret.

(10) Keeping off evil spirits : â Though AAv. and San. are 
entirely silent on this point several sutras devote large space to 
this topic and are full of mantras which are more are less magic. 
Ap. prescribes the offering of mustard seed and rice chaff in 
fire three times with each of eight mantras ( Ap. mantra- 
patha II. 13. 7-14 ). Bhar. gr. ( I. 23 ) also prescribes similar 
offerings with several verses. Hir. gr. requires the throwing of 
mustard seeds eleven times in the sutikagni with eleven mantras 
some of which are almost the same as in Bharadvaja. Par. gr. 
recites two of such mantras. 528 

It would not be out of place to mention a few other 
subsidiary matters. Baud., Ap., Hir. and Vaik. expressly say 
that the boy is to have a bath. The Hir. and Vaik. 537 say that 
the axe is to be placed on a stone and gold is to be placed on the 
axe, then these are to be turned upside down ( so that gold lies 
at the bottom and the stone is on top ) and then the boy is 
to be held head eastwards above the stone by a female in 
her two hands, while the father repeats the two mantras ' be a 
stone &c* and the mantra ' thou art produced from ( my ) limb 
by limb &c* This shows how what was once only symbolical 
(viz. uttering the mantras ' be a etone â¢ &c. indicating the desire 
that the boy should be strong, sharp and worthy like a stone, 
axe and gold ) became transformed into a rite requiring physical 
presence of these things. Par.. Ap., Hir., Bhar. and Vaik. 
prescribe that a pot full of water should be placed towards the 
head ( of the woman and her child ) with a mantra 'Oh waters !

watch while ( people are asleep ).' None of the sufcras ( except 
Vaikhanasa ) refers to any astrological details, Vaik. ( III. 14 ) 
says that when the child's nose appears, the position of the 
planets should he observed and his future welfare or otherwise 
should be examined, since the boy is to be so brought up as to 
enhance his good qualities. Both Ap. and Baud, say that the 
remnants of honey, curds and ghrfca should be mixed with water 
and poured out in a cowstable ( and not thrown about in an 
impure place ). This ceremony is comparatively brief in Ap., 
Sah. and a few others, but in Hirâ Par. and Bharadvaja it is 
most elaborate and would require an unduly long time consi- 
dering the state of the newly born child and the woman in 
child-bed. There is no wonder, therefore, that this ceremony 
gradually went out of vogue.. In modern times a few well-to-do 
families in Western India sometimes perform what is called 
1 putravana * ( in Marathi ) and make the boy lick honey and 
ghrta by means of a golden piece or ring. The dangers to the 
child of an elaborate ritual must have been apparent to all 
people even in ancient times. sZi 

The Sm. C. ( I. p. 19 ) 539 cites Harlta, Sankha, Jaimini to 
the effect that till the navel cord is cut there is no impurity, 
that the sarhskara may be performed till then and that gifts of 
jaggery, sesame, gold, clothes, cows and corn may be made and 
accepted. The same work quotes Samvarta and other smrfcia to 
the effect that the father must bathe before he can perform the 
jatakarma rite. This would involve some further loss of time 
and it is remarkable that the grhya sutras observe silence about 
this, though Manu V. 77 prescribes a bath on hearing of the 
birth of a son. The Sm. C. quotes Pracetas, Vyasa and others to 
the effect that a nandl&raddha ( which will be explained under 
Sraddha ) should be performed in jatakarma ( brahmanas are not 
to eat cooked food in this sraddha, but to receive corn or only 
money payment ). Later works like the Dharmasindhu say 
that in jatakarma as in other rights, svastivaoana, punyaha- 
vacana and matrkapujana are necessary. 

538. The author knows of an instance whore an old man jubilant over 
the birth of a son from his third wife entered upon the performance 
of the jatakarma according to his grhyasutra and by the time the 
ceremony was over, the helpless child that had already little vitality was 
dead owing to exposure and cold.

Medieval writers of digests give extensive descriptions of 
ianli rites 840 performed to counteract the inauspicious effects of 
birth on the 14th tithi of the dark half of a month or on the 
amSv&sya or on Mula, Silesa and Jyes^ha naksatras and certain 
astrological conjunctions like Vyatlpata, Vaidhrti, Samkr&nti 
( sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac into another ). These 
matters are passed over here for want of space, as of little 
importance in modern times and as new departures introduced in 
the ancient sutra rites by later works. A few general remarks will 
be made on these matters in the section on tfanti and Muhurta. 

In modern times on the 5th and 6th days after birth certain 
ceremonies are performed for which there is no warrant in the 
siltras. These probably arose in the times of the Puranas, since 
the only verses quoted on this point in the Nirnayasindhu, the 
Samskfiramaydkha and other works are the Markandeyapurana, 
Vyasa and Narada. On these days the father or other male 
relative bathes in the first part of the night, then invokes 
QaneSa, and certain minor deities called Janmada on handf uls 
of rice and also SasthldevI and BhagavatI ( i. e. Durga ) and 
worships them with sixteen upacaras. Then tambula and 
dakqina are offered to one or more brahmanas and the members 
of the family keep awake that night with songs ( in order to 
ward off evil spirits ). One text from the Markandeyapurana 
says * men fully armed should keep watch the whole night \ 
It must be noted here that fear springing from astrological 
considerations got better of even natural love and affection to 
such an extent that some writers advised that the child when 
born on certain inauspicious conjunctions should be abandoned 
and its face should not be seen till at least its eighth year. 
Vide Nityacarapaddhati pp. 244-255. 

Utthana .â(getting up from child-bed). According to Vaik. 
III. 18 on the 10th or 12th day after birth, the father shaves, bathes, 
purifies the house, performs in the jatakagni ( or in the ordinary 
fire, according to some) a sacrifice to the earth through some person 
belonging to another gotra. Then he brings back the aupaaana 
( grhya fire ), offers oblations to Dhatr and others (as in L 16), five 
obiations to Varuna ( 1. 17 ), the mulahoma ( I. 18 ) and feeds 
the brahmanas. San. gr. (I. 25 ) is more elaborate. It pre- 
scribes that a mess of cooked food is prepared in the sdtik&gni 

540 Vide ffci Hw mfim pp 846-47, sfchKHchW pp. 201-203. Â« *r*rt

and oblations are made to the tithi of the child's birth, 
and to three naksatras and to their presiding deities, two 
to Agni and then one ( i. e. 10th ) to Soma with Rg. L 91. 7. 
Hir. gr. IL 4. 6-9 ( S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 214 ) and Bharadv&ja 
(I. 26 ) also refer to uttham. Both say that the sfttikagni 
is taken away and the Aupasana fire is brought in and 
oblations of ghrfca ( 12 or 8 ) are offered in that fire with the 
mantras beginning with ' dhata dadatu no rayim \

( S. B. E. vol- 29, p. 50 ), Vaik. III. 19, Varaha gr. 2. 

There is great divergence of view as to the time when the 
child was named. Several times are suggested in the ancient 
literature and in the sutras and smrtis. 

(a) We have already seen ( p. 232 ) that a child was 
addressed by a name, according to Gobhila and Khadira, even 
in the Sosyantlkarma. 

(6) According to the Br. Up., Asv. and San., Kathaka gr. 
(34.1) a name was given to the child on the day of birth. This 
practice is supported by a passage of the Sat. Br. 54,< * * therefore 
when a eon is born ( the father ) should bestow on him a name ; 
thereby he drives away the evil that might attach to the boy ; 
( the father gives him ) even a second, even a third ( name ) '. 
The Mahabhasya of Patau jali appears to refer to this view. " In 
the world the parents give a name to the son when born in a 
closed space ( or room ) such as Devadatta, Yajfiadatta ; from 
their employment ( of that name for the boy ) others also come 
to know ' this is his appellation* ". 54 * 

541. For a comprehensive treatment of the way in which namei 
were given from Vedic times onwards, my paper * Naming a child or a 
person ' in the * Indian Historical Quarterly ' for 1938, vol. 14, pp. 24-44 
may be consulted. A summary of the points made in that paper is 
given below together with some fresh matter.

Cb. VI ] SaniskUras-Namakaraya 239 

(c) Ap., Baud., BhSr., and Par. prescribe the 10th day 
after birth for namakarana. The Mahabhasya quotes a passage 543 
from the Yajnikas that a name was given on a day after the 
tenth from birth. 

(d) Yaj. T. 12 prescribes it on the 11th day after birth. 

(e) Baud. gr. ( II. 1. 23 ) says that Namakarana may be 
performed on the 10th or 12th, while Hir. gr. says that it should 
be on the 12th. As Vaik. prescribes that the mother should get 
up from child-bed on the 10th or 12th and then speaks of 
namakarana, it follows that the ceremony was performed accord- 
ing to it on the 10th or 12feh. Manu II. 30 says it may be 
performed on the 10th or 12th day after birth or on an auspicious 
tithi, muhurta and naksatra thereafter. 

(/) Gobhila ( II. 8. 8, 8. B. E. vol. 30. p. 57 ) and 
Khadira 544 say that it should be on any day after ten nights, 
one hundred nights or a year from birfch. Laghu-Advalftyana 
( VI. 1 ) allows it on 11th, 12th or 16th day. Apararka (p. 26 ) 
quotes grhyaparisis^a to the 8ffect that it may be performed 
after the 10th night is passed or after 100 nights or a year and 
the Bhavisyat-purana to the effect that it may be performed after 
10 or 12 nights or on the 18th day or after a month. It is worthy 
of note that Ban a in his Kadambarl ( purvabhaga para 68 ) says 
that Taraplda named his son Oandraplda when the tenth day 
after birth fell on an auspicious muhurta and that the minister 
Sukanasa named his son Vaisampayana next day. 545 

The commentators were bewildered by these differences. 
Vtevarupa explains Manu II. 30 as ' when the 10th night is 
past ' and Kulluka does the same ( i. e. according to him it is 
performed on the eleventh day ). Medhatithi does not 548 like 
the addition of 'past' (atltayam) after * dasamyam * in Manu II. 
30 and says just as jaLakaniiA can be performed even when 
there is impurity due to birth, so namakarana may be performed 
on the 10th and that the only essential thing is that it is not to

be performed before the 10th or 12th. Apararka says that there 
is an option and one may follow one's own grhyasfttra. It 
appears that the namakarana S4T of HariSoandra, son of Jayat- 
candra, king of Kanoj, took place three weeks after jatakarma 
(on 31. 8. 1175 A. D. ). In modern times namakarana generally 
takes place on the 12th day after birth and no Vedio ceremony 
as prescribed in the sutras is gone through, but women assemble 
and after oonsulting the male members of the family beforehand 
announce the name and place the child in the cradle. 

In Bg. VIII. 80. 9 we read ' when you give us a fourth 
name connected with ( the performance of ) a sacrifice, we long 
for it ; immediately afterwards, you, our master, take us ' ( for- 
ward to glory ) 548 . This shows that a man could have a fourth 
name even in the times of fig. and the fourth was a name due to 
the performance of a yajna. Sayana explains that the four names 
are : naksatranama ( derived from the naksatra on which a 
person was born ), a secret name, a publicly known name and 
a fourth name like Somayajl (due to having performed a 
Somayaga ). In Rg. X. 54. 4 there appears to be a reference to 
four names ( though Sayana takes nama here to mean the body 
or deed ). In fig. IX. 75. 2 there is reference to a third name 
1 the son has a third name unknown to the parents and which is 
in the bright part of heaven \ The two names are the naksatra 
name and the ordinary name, while the third would be the name 
due to the performance of a sacrifice ( whioh the parents could 
not foresee at his birth ). In the Kg* frequent refeience is made 
to the secret name of a person. Vide Rg. IX 87. 3, X. 55. 1-2. 
We saw above ( note 541a ) that the Sat. Br. speaks of a second 
or even a third name for a person given to him by his parents. 
The same Brahmana 549 recommends * Therefore a brahmana

when he does nofc prosper should give himself a second name*. 
But how these names were formed is nofc stated anywhere in the 
Vedic literature. In the Tai. S. VI. 3. 1. 3 it is said Â§ therefore 
a brahmana who has two names prospers \ 5S0 The Sat. Br. ( II. 
1. 2. 11 ) says 4 Arjuna is the secret name of Indra and the 
constellation of Phalguuls being presided over by Indra they are 
really Arjunyah, but are called Phalgunyah in an indirect 
way \ 5S1 We saw above (p. 230) that the Br. Up. speaks of a secret 
name given by the father on the day of birth. Hardly any 
secret names are expressly mentioned in the Vedic literature 
except the name of Arjuna given to Indra ( and being secret they 
cannot be expected to be mentioned). How the secret name was 
given is not clear from the Vedic literature. In Vaj. S. 17. 89 
there is a reference to the secret name of ghrta 552 . The Tai. S. 
gives expression to the request that the ( ahavanlya ) } fire should 
bear the name of one who keeps sacred fires, while the person 
praying was away on a journey 853 . 

A few examples of the three names of a person from the 
Vedic literature may be given here. These are generally the 
ordinary name, a name derived from his father and a third 
from his gotra ( or from the name of some remote ancestor ). In 
Rg. V. 33. 8 we find Trasadasyu ( his own name ), Paurukutsya 
( son of Purukutsa \ Gairiksita ( descendant of Giriksita ). In 
the Ait. Br. ( 33. 5) Sunah&epa is spoken of as Ajlgarti ( son of 
Ajlgarta ) and also as Angirasa ( a gotra name ), while king 
Hariaicandra is mentioned ( Ait. Br. 33. 1 ) as Vaidhasa ( son of 
Vedhas ) and Aiksvaka ( descendant of Iksvaku ). In the 
Sat. Br. ( XIII. 5. 4. 1 ) Indrota Daivapa ( son of Devapi ) Saunaka 
( a gotra name ) is said to have been the priest of Janamejaya. 
In the Chan. Up. ( V. 3. 1 and 7 ) Svetaketu Aruneya ( son of 
Aruni ) is styled Gautama ( a gotra name ). In the Ka^hopanisad

%i% History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. VI 

(LI. land 11) Naciketas is the son of VajaSravasa and fa 
addressed as Gautama ( a gotra name ). 

Usually however a person is referred to in the Vedio 
literature by two names. In some oases it is his own name and 
a gotra name e. g, Medhyatithi Kanva ( Rg. VIII. 2. 40), 
Hiranyastupa Aiigirasa ( Rg. X. 149. 5 ), VatsaprI Bhalandana 
( Tai. S. V. 2. 1. 6 ), Balaki Gargya ( Br. Up. II. 1. 1 ), Cyavana 
Bhargava ( Ait. Br. 39. 7 ). In other cases a man is referred to 
by his own name and another name derived from a country 
or locality e. g. Kasu Caidya ( Rg. VIII. 5. 37 ), Bhlma Vaidarbha 
( Ait. Br, 35. 8 ), Durmukha Pancala ( Ait. Br. 39. 23 ), Janaka 
Vaideha ( Br. Up. III. 1. 1 ) K Ajatasiafcru Kasya (Br. Up. II. 1. 1). 
In some cases a matronymic is added to a person's name e. g. 
DlrghatamsP Mamateya ( Rg. I. 158. 6 ), Kutsa Arjuneya ( son of 
Arjunl, Rg. IV. 26. 1, VII. 19. 2, VIII. 1. 11 ), Kakslvat Ausija 
( son of a woman called Usik, Rg. I. 18. l f Vaj. S. III. 28 ), 554 
Prahlada Kayadhava ( son of Kayadhu, Tai. Br. I. 5. 10 ), 
Mahidasa Aitareya ( son of Itara, Chan. Up. III. 16.7 ). In the 
varhsa added at the end of the Br. Up. there are about forty 
sages with matronymic names. The practice of mentioning a 
man by reference to his mother's name or to his mother's father's 
gotra was continued till later times, as will be shown later on. 
The most usual method, however, of referring to a person in the 
Rg. and also in other Vedic works was to state his name along 
with another derived from his father's name. For example, 
Ambarlsa, Rjrasva, Sahadeva and Suradhas are all called 
Varsagira ( son of Vrsagir, Rg. I. 100. 17 ) ; king Sudas is called 
Paijavana ( son of Pijavana, Rg. VII. 18. 22 ), Devapi is 
A-TS^isena ( son of Rstisena, Rg. X. 98. 5-6), Sarhyu Barhaspatya 
( Tai. S.' IL 6. 10 ), Bhrgu Varuni ( Ait. Br. 13. 10 and Tai. Up. 
III. 1 ), Bharata Daussanti ( Satapatha XIII. 5. 4. 11, Ait. 
Br. 39. 9 ), Nabhanedistha Manava ( Ait. Br. 22. 9 ). 

The principal rules about names may now be set out from 
the grhyasutras. Asv. ( 1. 15. 4-10, S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 182-183 ) 
says * Let (them) give the boy a name beginning wifch a sonant, 
having a semivowel in it, with a vtsarga at the end, consisting of 
two syllables or of four syllables, of two syllables if (the father) 
is desirous of firm ( worldly ) position ( for his son ), of four 
syllables if he is desirous of spiritual eminence ( for his son ) ; 

554. ^rGfcR 7 on tm%ft VI. 1.37 explains the words srtfhRf V sftf^sr? 
( s^r. 1. 18. 1 ). Vide vsm** vol III. B . 33. 



Ch. VI ] Samskaraa-Namakaraya 243 

but (in all oases) with an even number of syllables in the cage 
of males and with an uneven number of syllables in the case of 
women. And let him find out (for the boy) a name to be 
employed at respectful salutations ( at Upanayana &c. ) ; that 
name ( the boy's ) mother and father alone should know till his 
upanayana' 555 . The San. gr. (S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 50) omits the rule 
about the name ending in a visarga and allows an option of *six 
syllables and adds that the name should be formed by a krt 
affix ( from a root ) and not by a taddhita ; that this name should 
be known only to his parents and that on the tenth day after 
birth the father should give the child a name for ordinary use 
which should be pleasing to brahmanas. It should be noticed that 
ASv. and San. differ on one very important point. According to 
Aiv. the name for which elaborate rules are laid down is to be 
the ordinary name and he lays down no rule about the forma- 
tion of the secret name ; while San. lays down for the secret 
name the same rules as A6v. does for the public one and San. 
says about the public name that it should be pleasing. 

Instead of quoting grhya sutras at length the principal 
rules about names deducible from them may be stated in the 
form of propositions with a few illustrations for each. 

(1) The first rule in almost all sutras is that the name 
for males should contain two or four syllables or an even 
number. This rule is deduced from Vedic literature where most 
of the names contain either two syllables ( e. g. Baka, Trita, 
Kutsa, Bhrgu ) or four syllables ( Trasadasyu, Purukutsa, 
Medhyatithi, Brahmadatta &c. ), though names of three sylla- 
bles ( like Kavasa, Cyavana, Bharata ) and of five syllables

( like Nabhanedistha, Hiranyastupa ) are not; wanting. Baija^ 
vapa 556 grhya allowed the name to be of one, two, three, four or 
any number of syllables. San. allowed a name even of six 
syllables and Baud, gr, ( II. 1. 25 ) of six or even eight. Exam- 
ples of names with two syllables and four syllables are given 
below. 

(2) Almost all grhya sutras contain the rule that the 
name should begin with a sonant and contain in the middle a 
semivowel. This is stated also in the ancient quotation from 
Yajnikas in the Mahabhasya. 

(3) Some sutras prescribe that the name should end in a 
visarga preceded 557 by a long vowel (e. g. Ap., Bhar., Hir.,Par.). 
Asv. only mentions that it should end in a visarga, while Vaik. 
and Gobhila say that it may end in a long vowel or in a visarga. 
These rules were probably based on such Vedic names as Sudas, 
Dlrghatamas, Prthusravas ( that occur in the Rgveda ) and such 
names as VatsaprI ( Tai. S. V, 2. 1. 6 ). 

(4) Ap. prescribes that the name should have two parts, the 
first being a noun and the second a verbal formation ( generally 
a past passive participle ). This rule is probably based on such 
ancient names as Brahmadatta ( which occurs in Br. Up. I. 3. 
24 and figures very much in Pali works ), Devadatta, Yajnadatta 
&c. 

(5) Many grhya sutras (like Par,, Gobhila, San., 
Baijavapa, VSraha ) say that the name should be formed from a 
root by a krt affix and should not be a taddhita (i. e. formed from 
a noun by an affix ), 

(6) Ap. and Hir. say that the name should have the 
upasarga * su ' in it as a Brahmana passage says that such a 
name has stability in it. Examples are Sujata, Sudarsana, 
Sukesas ( Prasna Up. 1. 1 ).

(7) Baud. gr. prescribes that, the name may be derived 
from a sage or a deity or an ancestor. 558 The Manava grhya, how- 
ever, forbids the giving of a name of a deity itself, but allows the 
giving of a name derived from the name of a deity or a naksa- 
tra. Examples of names derived from sages would be Vasistha, 
Narada &c. and of names taken from deities would be Visnu, 
Siva &c. The Mifc. on Yaj. I. 12 quotes a passage of Sankha 
that the name should be connected with one's family deity. It 
should be noticed that in modern times most names in many 
parts of India are the names of deities or of heroes supposed to 
be avataras of deities. In Vedic literature hardly any human 
being bears the name of any of the Vedic gods ( Indra, Mitra, 
Pusan &c ). There are only a few exceptions such as that of 
Bhrgu ( in Tai. Up. III. 1 ) who is said to have learnt from his 
father called Varuna and in the Prasna Up. ( I. 1 ) there is 
Saury ay ani Gargya whose name is derived from Surya. But in 
the Vedic Literature persons have names derived from the names 
of gods, such as Indrota ( Indra -f uta, protected ), Indradyumna. 
The names that occur in the Mahabhasya such as Devadatta, 
Yajnadatta, Vayudatfca ( vol. II. p. 296 ), Visnumitra ( vol. I. pp. 
41 and 359), Brhaspatidatfcaka (or Brhaspatika ), Prajapati- 
dattaka ( or-patika ), Bhanudattaka ( or Bhanuka ) and others 
set out in the Mahabhasya ( vol, II, p. 425 ) exemplify the rule 
of the Manavagrhya. It is difficult to say when the very names 
of deities began generally to be borne by human beings. 
Probably the practice began in the first centuries of the Christian 
era. From the fifth century onwards we have historic examples 
of such names, e. g. in the Eran stone inscriptions of Budha- 
gupta dated in the Gupta sarhvat 165 i. e. 484-5 A. D. ( Gupta 
Inscriptions No. 19 ) there is a brahmana Indra-Visnu, son of 
Varuna-Visnu, son of Hari-Visnu. 

(8) Baud., Par., Gobhila ( and the Yajnikas quoted by 
the Mahabhasya ) prescribe that the name of the boy may be the 
same as that of any of the ancestors of the father. The Manava 
gr. ( 1, 18 ) expressly says that the father's own name should not 
be given. This practice was observed in ancient times and 
continues even today, when the child is often given his grand- 
father's name. 559 Vide I. A. vol. VI. p. 73 where we see that 
Pulakesi II was grandson of Pulakesi I.

(9) The grhyasutras (except Par. and Manava) are agreed 
that a secret name is to be given to the boy by the parents, in the 
Sosyantlkarma according toGobhila and Khadira, at birth accord- 
ing to some (like Asv. and Ka^haka) and according to others (like 
Apâ Baud., Bhar. ) at the time of Namakarana on 10th or 12th 
day. We saw above that San. and Kathaka give elaborate rules 
about the secret name, which rules are those of the Vyavaha- 
rika 560 name according to Asv, and many other sutrakaras. 
Gobhila and Khadira give no rules about the secret name. Ap., 
Hir. and Vaik. only say that the secret name should be derived 
from the naksatra of birth, but give no further rules. Bhara- 
dvaja 581 speaks of the giving of two names in Namakarana, one 
being derived by applying the intricate rules described above 
and the other being a naksatra name ; but it is not quite clear 
which was to be the secret name ; it is probable, however, that 
the naksatra name was to be the secret one. According to A6va- 
layana the secret name was called Abhivadanlya ( which was 
to be known to the parents only till the boy's upanayana and 
which was to be used by the boy for announcing himself in 
respectful salutations ) ; but he does not say how it was to be 
derived. Gobhila, Khadira, Varaha (5) and Manava speak of an 
abhivadanlya name. Gobhila prescribes that this name was to be 
given to the boy at the time of upanayana by the acarya and was 
to be derived from the naksatra of birth or from the presiding 
deity of that naksatra. Gobhila 568 further adds that accord- 
ing to some teachers the abhivadanlya name was derived from 

560. According to the Kathaka grhya < 34. 1-3 and 36 ) only one 
is given ( on the day of birth ) and the same is used in Namakarana 
( 36. 3 ), but it mentions that it was the view of some that another 
name was to be given in Namakarana. 

I. 26. 

562. iftntt? and ^ti%* appear to suggest three names, one that was 
secret given in ^ft g ^>c fi^4 (Â»ftmt7 II. 7. 15-16 ), the 2nd in namakarana 
('in^r^ II. 8. 8 and 14-16 derived by means of the intricate rules specified 
above ) and a third in Upanayana called 3T(*ter^fta Ofii*ra> II. 10. 21-25), 
According to them a name like Hfrnrisjr would be the fourth name. In 
^ITH I. 7 it is said that in the gpqr^l ^ the following names of the

the gotra of the boy ( as e. g. Qargya, Sfindilya, Gautama &o. )â¢ 
This practice is based on the usage we find in the Upanisads, 
where SatyakSma when about to go to a teacher for Vedio 
study asks his mother what his gotra was ( Chan. Up. IV. 4. 1 ) 
and where the teacher also asks him what his gotra was. In 
the Kathopanisad Naoiketas is styled Gautama and in Chan. V. 
3. 7 Svetaketu is addressed as Gautama by Pravahana J>ivali 
when the latter expounded Samvarga-vidya to the former. But 
if the abhivadanlya was a gotra name there could have been no 
secrecy. From Gobhila it appears that the acarya told the boy 
his abhivadanlya name, but the Khadira suggests that the boy 
already knew it( from his father or mother) and informed the 
teacher. The naksatranama was of importance in the perform- 
ance of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedangajyofcisa 562 ( of the Rg ) 
in verses 25-28 enumerates 28 naksatras ( adding Abhijit after 
Uttarasadha and before Sravana ) and their presiding deities 
and adds that in sacrifices the sacrificer is to bear a name 
derived from the name of the presiding deity of his naksatra. 
The object of keeping the naksatra name secret seems to have 
been to prevent rites of abhicara ( magical practices ) against a 



^l^r ^ftrar (3R". ) verso 28. In the Vedio Literature and in the Vedafiga 
Jyotisa the naksatras are enumerated from Kittika* to Apabharani and 
not f rom A^vinl to Revati as in medieval and modern times. For the 
position of Abhijit, vide Tai. Br. 1. 5. 2. The naksatras and their presiding 
deities may profitably be specified here. Some of the names differ from 
the modern ones. The oldest lists are in the Atharvaveda (19. 7. 2-5) and

person, for the effective employment of which it was necessary 
to know a person's name, 564 

Hundreds of names occur in the Vedic Literature, but 
there are hardly any names directly derived from a naksatra. 
In the Satapatha ( VI. 2. 1. 37 ) there is an Asadhi Sau^romateya 
(son of Asadha and Su&romata ). Here Asadha is probably 
connected with the naksatra Asadha. It appears therefore that 
in the times of the brShmanas naksatra names were secret and 
so are not met with. Gradually however naksatra names ceased 
to be secret and became common. For several centuries before 
the Christian era naksatra names were very common. Panini 
( who cannot be placed later than 300 B. C. and may have 
flourished some centuries earlier still ) "gives several rules 
( IV. 3. 34-37 and VII. 3. 18 ) for deriving names of males 
and females from naksatras. In IV. 3. 34 he says that 
names are derived from Sravistha, PhalgunI, Anuradha, Svati, 
Tisya,Punarvasu,Hasta, Asadha andBahula (Krttika) without 
adding any termination signifying ' born on ' ( e. g. we have 
the names Sravisthali, Phalgunah &c. ). In VII. 3. 18 he derives 
the name Prosthapadah from Prosthapada. In the Junagadh 
inscription of Rudradaman ( 150 A. D. ) the brother-in-law of 
Candragupta Maurya is said to have been a vaisiya named 
Pusyagupta ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 43 ). This shows that in the 4th 
century B. C. a name was derived from the naksatra Pusya ( so 
the name was naksatrasraya ). The Mahabhasya ( vol. I. p. 231 ) 
speaks of boys named Tisya and Punarvasu and cites Citra, 
RevatI, RohinI as names of women born on these naksatras 
( vol. II. p. 307 ) and of Caitra as a male ( vol. II. p. 128 ). 
The Mahabhasya speaks of Pusyamitra, the founder of the 
Sufiga dynasty ( vol. I. p. 177, vol. II. pp. 34 and 123 ). Buddhists 
also had naksatra names e. g. Moggaliputta Tissa ( where a 
gotra name and a naksatra name from Tisya are combined ), a 
parivrajaka Pofthapada in DIgha I. p. 187 and III. p. 1 ( from 
the naksatra Prosthapada ), Asada, Phaguna, Svatiguta, Pusara- 
khita and in the Sand inscriptions of 3rd century B. C. ( E. I. 
( vol. II. p. 95 ). The giving of naksatra names continued for 
centuries after the Christian era. For example/ in the Palitana 
plate of Dhruvasena I dated Valabhi samvat 210 (about 
529 A. D. ) there is a brahmana named Vi6akha. We have

names like Pusyasvaml, RohinlsvamI ( in the plates of JativarSja 
dated 602-3 A. D., in E. I. voi. IX. p. 288 ). Another way of 
deriving names from naksatras was to form them from the 
presiding deity of the naksatra on which a person was born. 
A man was called Agneya, if he was born on Krttiika ( Agni 
being its devata ), Maitra ( from being born on Anuradha ). 
In modern times this round-about way is given up and persons 
are named directly from the names of gods and avataras 
( like Rama ). 

There is another way of deriving names from naksatras 
set forth in medieval works on Dharmasastra and Jyotisa. 
Each of the 27 naksatras is divided into four padas and to each 
pada a specific letter is assigned ( e. g., cu, ce, co and la for the 
padas of AsvinI) from which names are derived for persons born 
in those padas ( e. g. Cudamani, Cedlsa, Colesa and Laksmana 
for the four padas of AsvinI ). 565 These names are secret and 
are even now muttered into the ear of the brahmacarl in Upana- 
yana and are known as the name in the daily samdhya prayer. 

Modern works like the Sarhskaraprakasa ( p. 237 ) say that 
four kinds of names may be given viz. devatanama, masanSma, 
naksatranama and vyavaharikanama. The first shows that the 
bearer is the devotee of that devata. The Nirnayasindhu 566 quotes 
a verse about twelve names derived from the month in which a 
man was born and adds that the Madanaratna laid down that 
the names specified in the verse were to be given to the months 
from Margaslrsa or Caitra. Such names ( of Visnu ) are being 
given now, particularly in Western India, but without regard to 
the month of birth. So early as in the Brhatsamhita of

Varahamihira the twelve names of Visnu are associated with 
the twelve months. 567 

As to the names of girls, some special rules were laid down. 
Many grhyasutras say that the names of girls should contain 
an "uneven number of syllables and the Manava gr. ( 1. 18 ) 
expressly says that the names of girls should be of three sylla- 
bles. Par. and Varahagrhya further say that the names of girls 
should end in * 5 \ Gobhila and Manava say they should end in 
' da â¢ (as in Satyada, Vasuda, Yasioda, Narmada), Sahkha-likhita 
dharmasutra and Baijavapa require that it should end in ' I ' , 
while the Baud. 568 gr. &esa-sutra says that it should end in a 
long vowel. The Varahagrhya adds an intricate rule that the 
name of a girl should have an " a ' vowel in it and should not 
be after a river, a naksatra or should not be the name of the 
sun or moon or Pusan and should not be one having the idea of 
* given by god * as in Devadatta or having the word * raksita ( as in 
Buddharaksita ). 569 Manu II. 33 prescribes that the names of 
women should end in a long vowel, should be easy to pronounce, 
should not suggest any harsh acts, should be perspicuous, should 
be pleasing to the ear, auspicious and should convey some bles- 
sing and in III. 9 Manu and Ap. gr. III. 13 say that one should 
not marry a girl named after naksatras, trees, rivers. In modern 
times girls frequently bear the names of the great rivers of 
India ( Sindhu, Jahnavl, Yamuna, Tapl, Narmada, Goda, Krsna, 
Kaverl &c. ). 

It is remarkable that Manu altogether omits the involved 
rules given by the grhya sutras about naming a boy and prescri- 
bes ( II. 31-32 ) two simple rules viz. that the names of all the 
members of the four varnas should suggest respectively auspici- 
ousness, vigour, wealth and lowness ( or contempt ) and that the 
names of brahmanas and the other varnas should have an 
addition (upapada) suggestive of barman (happiness), raksa

( protection ), pustf ( prosperity ) and presya ( service or depen- 
dence on others). It is significant that none of the grhya- 
sutras exoept Paraskara 570 makes any reference to these 
additions (barman and the like ) to the names of brahmanas and 
others. Therefore this was comparatively a later development, 
though such additions must have been in vogue at least two 
centuries before the Christian era. The Mahabhasya 571 (vol. 
III. p. 416 ) cites Indravarman and Indrapalita as the names of 
a rajanya and a vaisya. Yama quoted by Apararka ( p. 27 ) 
says 578 that the names of brahmanas should have the addition 
of karma or deva, of ksatriyas varma or trata, of vaisyas bhuti or 
datta, and of 6udras dasa. Similar rules are given in the 
Puranas 573 . These rules were sometime observed, but were 
often broken from very ancient times as inscriptions show. A 
striking example of the observance of these rules is contained 
in the Talgunda Inscription of Kakutsthavarman of the 
Kadamba family ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 24 ) where the founder who 
was a brahmana is styled MayuraSarman, but his descendants 
who were kings had names ending in varman ( which was 
appropriate to ksatriyas ). On the other hand we have frequent 
breaches of these rules. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 35 
( 0. I. L vol. Ill, p. 150, at p. 156 the Mandasor Ins. of YaSodhar- 
man of M&lava year 589, 645-46 A. D. ) the genealogy of the 
brahmana ministers is Sasthldatta, his son Varahadasa, his son 
Raviklrti ( so the upapadas ' datta ' and ' dasa ' appropriate to 
vaisyas and 6udras respectively were added to brahmana 
names ). In the Neulpur plate of Subhakara of Orissa ( 8th 
century A. D., E. I. vol. XV. p. 4 ) we have several bhattas 
whose names end in vardhana, datta and svamin. In the 
Nidhanpura plate of Bhaskaravarman ( E. I. vol. ; XIX p. 115) 
among the numerous donees (who must have been all brahmanas) 
there are some who are named Sraddhadasa, Karkadafcta and 
Merudatfca. In the Inscr iptions of the Saka king Damijada

of the year 60 (0. I. I. vol. II. p. 16) his father is called 
Valavadha ( Balavardhana ) and his son Mitravadhana 
(Mitravardhana ). 

A few words may be said about mafcronymics. A few 
examples of such names have been given above from Vedic 
Literature. Asv. gr. 574 (I. 5. 1. ) says that in selecting a bride- 
groom or bride " one should first examine the family, as has been 
already said * those who on the mother's and father's side ' ". 
This refers to the As v. Srauta sufcra where it is required that 
both parents of the brahmana at the time of camasabhaksana 
in Dasapeya should be for ten generations perfect in their 
learning, austerities, and meritorious works and who can be 
traced to have throughout been of the brahmana class on both 
sides &c. Yaj. I. 54 enjoins that one should choose a girl from 
a great family of srotriyas, which has been famous for ten 
generations ( for learning and character ). Therefore when in 
certain cases a person is named after his mother or after the 
gotra of his mother's father, all that is intended to be conveyed 
is that he is descended from worthy male and female ancestors. 
There is no question in such cases of matriarchy. In the Nasik 
Inscription No. 2 ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 60) siri Pulumayi is des- 
cribed as Vasithlpufca and in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 88 the Abhlra 
king Isvarasena is described as Madharlputra. 575 In a Scythian 
Inscription ( E. I. vol. X at page 108 ) we have mention of ' the 
son of Bhargavl '. In all these cases the mother's gotra name is 
specially emphasized probably to convey that the mothers were 
of the bluest blood. Comparatively late writers mention the 
gotra in which their mother was born ( e. g. Bhavabhuti who 
flourished about 700-750 A. D. says that he was a Kasyapa 
while his mother was a Jatukarrtl ). From a Karika in the 
Mahabha^ya we learn that the great grammarian Panini was 
the son of a Daksl. Panini himself 576 ( IV. 1. 147 ) delivers a

special rule about the formation of a name for a man from the 
gotra name of his mother to convey contempt ( e. g. Gargah or 
Gargikah, a rogue, from his mother's name Gargl). 577 S&nkha- 
yana grhya ( L 25. 2-9, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 52 ) prescribes that 
the father and mother (having bathed themselves and the child) 
should put on new clothes, that the father should cook a mess 
of food in the sutikagni, that he is to offer oblations to the tithi 
of the boy's birth and to three constellations with their presiding 
deities, that he is to place in the middle the oblation to the 
naksatra of birth and he should make two other oblations to 
fire with two mantras and then the 10th oblation is made to Soma 
with Rg. I. 91. 7, The father pronounces aloud the child's 
name and causes the brahmanas to say auspicious words. 

The Asv. gr. does not describe Namakarana. Many of 
the other grhyasutras prescribe that the sutikagni is to be 
removed and the homa for namakarana is to be performed in 
the Aupasana ( grhya ) fire. The BhSradvaja gr. 578 prescribes 
the repetition of the Jaya, Abhyatana and Rastrabhrt mantras 
and the offering of eight oblations of ghrfca with the eight 
mantras ' may Dhatr bestow on us wealth ' (Ap. M. P. II. 11. Iff). 
The Hir. gr. ( II. 4. 6-14, S. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 214-215 ) contains 
similar rules. It prescribes twelve oblations with the mantras 
* may Dhatr bestow on us wealth ' and gives two names ( a 
secret naskatra name and an ordinary name ) to the boy. The 
twelve oblations are as follows : four to Dhatr, four to Anu- 
mati, two to Raka, two to Sinivali. According to some a 
thirteenth oblation to Kuhu was to be offered. 

The later works state many details which it is unnecessary 
to set out. The mother with her child on her lap sits to the 
right of the father. Some late writers prescribe that the fathei 
is to give a secret name to the boy and should spread huskec

grains of rice in a vessel of bronze, write thereon with a golden 
pen the words * salutations to Sri Ganapati * and then write four 
names of the boy, viz. kuladevata nama ( such as Yogesvarl- 
bhakta ), then masanama ( vide note 566 above), a vyavaharika* 
nama, a naksatranama. 57d 

Some sutra works add a detail immediately after Nama- 
karana. For example, Asv. gr. ( 1. 15. 11 ) says * when a father 
returns from a journey he holds in his hands his son's head, 
mutters the verse 'angad afigad &c.' and thrice smells (kisses) his 
son on the head. Ap. gr. 15. 12 58 Â° prescribes that on returning 
from a journey the father should address his son ( abhimantrana ) 
with the verse * angad, 1 should smell the child on the head with 
the verse ' be thou an axe ' and should mutter in his right ear 
five mantras. These rules have a very ancient origin. The 
Kausltaki Br. Up. II. 11 says that on returning from a journey 
the father touches the head of a son with the verse * angad-angad 
&c/ and takes the name of the boy and also repeats the verse 
' asma bhava ' &c. In the case of the girl there is no 
smelling of the head nor muttering in the ear, but only 
address ( with a prose formula ). This no doubt indicates that 
greater value was attached to a son than to a daughter, but it 
also shows that the daughter was not altogether neglected. 

Karnavedha : â ( piercing the lobes of the ears of the child ). 
In modern times this is generally done on the 12th day after 
birth. In the Baud. gr. sesa-sutra ( 1, 12 ) karnavedha is pres- 
cribed in the 7th or 8fch month, while Brhaspati quoted in Sarhs- 
karaprakasa ( p. 258 ) says that it may be performed on the 10th, 
12th or 16th 581 day from birth or in the 7th or 10th month from 
birth. The Sm. C. has a brief note on karnavedha. The grhya- 
parisista says that the father sits facing the east in the first half 
of the day and first addresses the right ear of fche boy with the 
mantra * Oh gods, may we hear bliss with our ears * ( Rg. I. 89. 
8 ) and then also the left ear. If the boy cries honey is to be

given to him ; after the rite brahmanas are to be fed. In modern 
times, generally a goldsmith is called who pierces the lower 
lobes of the ears with a pointed golden wire and turns it into 
a ring round the lobes. In the case of girls the left ear is 
pierced first. That ears of boys were pierced even in ancient 
times is suggested by a mantra quoted in the Nirukta. 582 ' He 
( the teacher ) who pierces the ear with truth, without causing 
pain and yet bestowing ambrosia, should be regarded as one's 
father and mother \ 

Niskramana- â (Taking the child out of the house in the open). 
This is a minor rite. Par. gr. I. 17 gives the briefest description. 
Vide also Gobhila II. 8. 1-7 ( S. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 56-57 ), Khadira 
II. 3. 1-5 ( S. B. E. vol. 29.p. 396), Baud. gr. 11.2, Manava gr. 1. 19. 
1-6, Kathaka gr. 37-38. 582 This was done according to most 
authorities in the 4th month after birth. Apararka (p. 28) quotes 
a purana that the going out of the house may be done on the 
12th day or in the 4th month. According to Par. gr. the father 
makes the child 584 look at the sun pronouncing the verse ' that 
eye' (Vaj. S. 36. 24). The Manavagrhya prescribes that the 
father cooks a mess of food in milk and offers oblations thereof 
to the sun with the verses * the brilliant sun has risen in 
the east ' ( Mait. S. 4. 14. 4 ), 'he is the hcuhsa sitting in pure 
worlds' (Rg. IV. 40. 5=Mait. S. II. 6. 12=Tai. S. I. 8. 15. 2 ), 
' whenever him ' ( Rg. X. 88. 11 ) and then he worships the sun 
with the verse ' that J&tavedas * ( Rg. I. 50. 1, it occurs in all 
Samhitas ) and then he should present the child turning its face 
towards the sun with the verse ' salutation to thee, Oh divine 
( sun ) who hast hundreds of rays and who dispellest darkness,

then brahmanas are to be fed and the fee is to be a bull. Baud.

gr. ( II. 2 ) prescribes a homa with eight oblations. Gobhila 
speaks of candradarSana. It says that on the 3rd tithi of the 
third bright fortnight after birth, the father bathes the child in 
the morning, worships in the evening the moon with folded 
hands, then the mother, having dressed the child, hands it with 
its face to the north from the south to north to the father and 
herself passes behind the back of the father and stands to the 
north of him, who worships with the three verses 585 * Oh thou 
whose hair is well parted, thy heart ' ( Mantrabrahmana I. 5, 
10-12 ), then the father hands back the son to the mother with 
the words ' that this son may not come to harm and be torn 
from his mother'. Then in the following bright fortnights, the 
father filling his joined hands with water and turning his face 
towards the moon, lets the water flow out of his joined hands 
once with the Yajus * what is the moon ' ( Mantrabrahmana I. 
5. 13 ) and twice silently. The Khadiragrhya has practically 
the same rules, except that it does not speak of two times. It 
will be noted that both omit the sight of the sun, but only 
mention the seeing of the moonÂ» Laghu-Asvalayana VII. 
1-3 speaks of the performance of abhyudayika sraddha, then 
reciting the sukta from 'svasti no mimltam' (Rg. V. 51. 11 ) and 
' Ssu sisanah ' ( Rg. X. 103. 1 ), showing the boy to the sun in 
the courtyard of one's father-in-law or in that of another and 
then repeating the verse * that eye ' ( Vaj. S. 36. 24 ). The Sm. 
C. remarks that those in whose sakha this rite is not mentioned 
need not perform it. The SamskaraprakaSa pp. 250-256 and 
Samskararatnamala pp. 886-888 give an extensive description 
and make of this sarhskara a matter of great pomp, festivity 
and rejoicing. Yama 586 quoted in Sam. Pr. says that seeing 
the sun and seeing the moon should be done respectively in the 
3rd and 4th months from birth.

month from birth as the time for this samskara ; but Manava 
gr. says it may be the 5th or 6th ; while Sankha quoted by 
Apararka says it should be performed at the end of a year or at 
the end of six months, according to some 587 . The Kathaka gr. 
enjoins the sixth month from birth or the time when the child 
first strikes teeth. The procedure is very brief in all except 
San. and Par. San. says that the father should prepare food of 
goat's flesh, or flesh of partridge, or of fish or boiled rice, if he is 
desirous of nourishment, holy lustre, swiftness or splendour 
respectively and mix one of them with curds, honey and ghee 
and should give it to the child to eat with the reciting of the 
Mahavyahrtis ( bhuh, bhuvah, svah ). Then the father is to 
offer oblations to fire with four verses ' Annapate ' , 588 Rg. 
IV. 12. 4-5 and * him, Oh Agni, lead to long life and splendour 
&o \ The father recites over the child the verse Rg. IX. 66. 19 
and then sets down the child on northward pointed kusa grass 
with Rg. I. 22. 15. The mother is to eat the remnant of the 
food thus prepared. A&v. has almost the same rules as to food 
( omitting fish ) but prescribes only one versa ' Annapate '. Ap. 
gr. 589 prescribes feeding of brahmanas, making them give 
benedictions to the child and thon making the child eat only 
once amess of curds, honey, ghee and boiled rice mixed together, 
with the recitation of a mantra joined to the three vyahrtis 
singly and collectively and says that according to some the 
flesh of partridge may also be added. Bhar. says that the method 
of making a child eat is the same as in Medhajanana and is 
silent about the food. Par. gr. ( I. 19 ) prescribes the cooking 
of sthallpaka and offering the two ajyabhagas and then two 
offerings of ghee with the mantras * the gods generated 590 the 
goddess of speech &c ' ( Rg. VIII. 100. 11 ) and the verse ' may 
vigour to-day produce for us gifts &c * ( Vaj. S. 18, 33 ). Manava, 
Kanaka and Vaik. are entirely silent about flesh. Kanaka

prescribes the cooking of all havisya food 591 and the other two 
works prescribe food cooked in milk. 

It will be seen from the above that the principal part of the 
sarhskara is making the child taste food. Some writers add 
homa, feeding of brahmanas, and benedictions. The Sarhskara- 
prakasa ( pp. 267-279 ) and Sarhskararatnamala ( pp. 891-895 ) 
have very detailed notes on this sarhskara. One interesting 
matter quoted by Apararka ( p. 28 ) from Markandeya is that on 
the day of this ceremony, in front of the gods worshipped in the 
house, tools and utensils required in various arts and crafts, 
weapons and sastras should be spread about and the child 
should be allowed to crawl among them and what the child 
seizes at first should be noted and it should be deemed that he 
is destined to follow that profession for his livelihood which is 
represented by the thing first touched by him. 

Varsavardhana or abdapurti : â In some of the sutras provi- 
sion is made for some ceremonies every month on the day of 
the birth of the child for one year and on every anniversary 
of the day of birth throughout life. For example, Gobhila gr. 
( II. 8. 19-20 ) says ' every month of the boy's birth for one year 
or on the parva days of the year he should sacrifice to Agni and 
Indra, to Heaven and Earth and to the Visve devas. Having 
sacrificed to these deities he should sacrifice to the tithi and 
naksatra \ 5 * 2 The San. gr. ( I. 25. 10-11 S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 52 ) 
similarly says l having sacrificed in the same way every month 
on the tithi of the child 's birth, he sacrifices when one year has 
expired in the ( ordinary ) domestic fire \ Baud. gr. III. 7 59 * 
prescribes an offering of cooked rice for life ( ayusyacaru ) 
' every year, every six months, every four months, every 
season or every month on the naksatra of birth*. Kanaka 
gr. ( 36. 12 and 14 ) prescribes a homa every month after 
namakarana for a year in the same way as in namakarana 
or jatakarma and at the end of the year an offering of the

flesh of a goat and sheep to Agni and Dhanvantari and 
feeding the brahmanas wifch food mixed with plenty of ghee. 
Vaik. III. 20-21 speaks at great length of the ceremony called 
4 Varsavardhana ' ( increase of the years of a person ) to be 
performed on the anniversary of the birfch-day every year and 
lays down that in this rite the deity of the naksatra on which a 
child is born is the principal one, that oblations of ghee are to 
be offered to that deity and naksatra and then to the other 
presiding deities of the naksatras and to the naksatras them- 
selves, then an oblation with the vyahrti ( bhuh svaha ), then 
offerings to Dhata. It describes in detail how different cere- 
monies are to be performed up to Upanayana, then up to 
finishing of Veda study, how ceremonies are to be performed on 
tho anniversary day of one's marriage, on the naksatra on which 
a person performed solemn sacrifices like Agnistoma and that if 
he thus lives till 80 years and 8 months he becomes one who 
has seen a thousand (full) moons and is called ' brahma- 
6arlra \ in celebration of which several ceremonies are pres- 
cribed ( which for want of space are not set out here ). In 
connection with the anniversary of the marriage day, 59i Vaik. 
specially prescribes that whatever ceremonies women direct as 
done traditionally should be performed. Apararka (p. 29 ) 
quotes verses of Markandeya to the effect that all should every 
year on the day of birth celebrate a festival ( mahotsava ) 
in which one should honour and worship one's elders, Agni, 
gods, Prajapati, the pitrs, one's naksatra of birth and brahmanas. 
The Krtyaratnakara (p. 540), the Nityacarapaddhati (pp. 
621-624) quote the same verses (as Apararka does) and add 
that on that day one should worship Markandeya ( who is 
believed to be immortal ) and the seven other cirajivins. 595 The 
Nityacarapaddhati ( p. 621 ) quotes a verse that in the case of 
kings the anniversary of the day on which they were crowned 
should be celebrated. The Nirnayasindhu, the Samskaraprakasa 
( which in pp. 281-294 gives the most elaborate treatment ) call

this festival * abdapurti \ The Samskararatanamala contains a 
very extensive discourse on this rite ( pp. 877-886 ) and calls 
this festival * ayurvardhapana \ The Nirnayasindhu and the 
Samskararafcnamala set out the verses that are addressed to 
Markandeya and others. In modern times women do celebrate 
every month the birthday of a child and the first anniversary of 
birth. They make the child cling to the principal house-post or 
to the post used for churning out butter from the pail of curds 
and water. 

Caula or Cudakarma or Cudakarmia : â ( the first cutting of 
the hair on the child'd head ). This sarhskara is mentioned by 
every writer. ' Cuda ' means the * lock or tuft of hair' kept on the 
head when the remaining part is shaved ( i. e. the sikha); so 
cudakarma or cudakarana means that rite in which a lock of 
hair is kept ( for the first time after birth ). We get * Cauda * 
from * cuda * 596 meaning ' a rite the purpose of which is keeping 
a lock of hair ' and * da ' and * la ' often interchange places. So 
we get * cauda ' or ' caula ' also as the name of the ceremony. 

According to many 597 writers caula was performed in the 
third year from birth. Baud. gr. (II. 4), Par. gr. (II. 1 ), 
Manu II. 35, Vaik. III. 23 say that it may be performed in the 
1st or 3rd year; As v. gr. and Varaha gr. say it may be performed 
in the 3rd year or in the year in which it is the custom 
of the family to perform it. Par. also refers to family usage. 
Yaj. specifies no year, but mentions only family usage. Yama 
quoted by Apararka ( p. 29 ) allowed it in the first, 2nd or 3rd 
year, while Sankha-Likhita allowed it in the 3rd or 5th 
( Apararka p. 29 ), Sad-guru-sisya quoted in the Samskaraprakasa 
( p. 296 ) and Narayana ( on Asv. gr. I. 17. 1 ) say that some per- 
formed it at the time of upanayana.

Oh. VI ] SamskarasrCaula 261 

Whether such a ceremony was performed in the Vedic ages 
cannot be ascertained with certainty. Bhar. gr. I. 28 expressly 598 
refers to the Vedic verse ( Rg IV. 75. 17 or Tai. S. IV. 6. 4. 5 ) 
as indicative of the practice of Caula in Vedic times ' where 
arrows fall together like boys having many tufts of hair \ 
Manu II. 35 also has in view this Vedic verse. 

The principal act in this ceremony is the cutting of the hair 
of the child. The other subsidiary matters are the performance 
of noma, feeding of brahmanas, receiving of their benedictions 
and giving of daksina, the disposal of cut hair in such a way 
that no one can find them. 

The ceremony is to be performed on an auspicious day as 
set out in note 494 above. Ap. gr. 16. 3 says ifc should be per- 
formed when the moon is in conjunction with Punarvasu 
naksatra, while Manava gr. says that; ifc should nofc be done on 
the 9fch tit hi of a month. Later works like the Samskaraprakasa 
(pp. 299-315) give very intricate rules about the auspicious 
times, which rules are passed over here. The most exhaustive 
treatment of this ceremony in the sufcra works is to be found in 
Asv., Gobhila, Varaha 4 and Par. II. 1. 

The materials required in this ceremony are stated as 
follows : â (1) To fcho north of the fire are placed four vessels 
each of which is separately filled with rice, barley, masa beans 
and sesame respectively ( Asv. gr. 1. 17. 2 ), but Gobhila ( IT. 9. 
6-7 ) says that they are to be placed to the east and Gobhila 
and San. say that these are to be given to the barber at the end 
of the rite ; (2) to the west of the fire the mother with the boy 
on her lap is to be seated and two vessels one filled with the 
dung of a bull and the other with iami leaves are to be also 
placed to the west ( Gobhila II. 9. 5 and Khadira II. 3. 18 place 
the dung to the north of the fire and Khadira says that she sits 
to the north ) ; (3) to the right of the mother the father sits 
holding 21 bunches 599 of kuÂ§a grass or the brahma priest ( if 
there be any) may hold them ; (4) warm and cold water or only 
warm water ; (5) an ordinary razor or one made of Udumbara 
wood ( according to Khadira II. 3. 17 and Gobhila II. 9. 4 ) ; (6) a

mirror (Gobhila and Khadira ). According to Gobhila and 
Khadira the barber, hot water, mirror, razor and bunches of 
kusa grass are to the south of the fire and bull's dung and a 
mess of rice mixed with sesame are to the north of the fire. 
Asv., Par., Kathaka and Manava say that the razor is to be of 
loha ( which the commentator Narayana explains as coppar ). 

After homa is performed, the principal matter (of cutting the 
hair) is to be begun. According to Gobhila and Khadira the father t 
having contemplated upm Savitr, looks at the barber with the 
mantra * here comes Savitr' ( Mantra-br. I. 6. 1 ) and contem- 
plating on Vayu looks at the warm water with the mantra 4 with 
warm water, Oh Vayu, come hither ' ( Mantra-Br. I. 6. 2 ). The 
father then mixes the hot and cold water and may put, in a part 
of the water, butter or drops of curds and apply the water to 
moisten three times the boy's head with the mantra * may Aditi 
cut thy hair ; may the waters moisten ( thy hair ) for vigour \ 
Then 600 on the right portion of the boy's hair the father puts 
three kusa bunches with the points towards the boy with the 
formula * herb, protect him ' ( Tai. S. I. 2. 1. 1 ). With the 
words * Axe, do not harm him ' ( Tai. S. I. 2. 1. 1 ) he presses a 
copper razor ( on the kusa blades ). The hair is cut with the 
mantra ' with that razor with which Savitr, the wise, cut ( the 
hair > of king Soma and of Varuna, cut now his (the boy's hair), 
Oh brahmanas, so that he may be endowed with long life and 
( reach ) old age '. Each time the hair is cut, he gives 601 the cut 
hair with their ends turned towards the east together with saral 
leaves to the mother, who puts them down on the bull dung. 
Cutting is done a second time with the mantra * with what 
Dhata shaved ( the head ) of Brhaspati, Agni and Indra for the 



600. The several sutras generally cite different mantras at the time 
of the performance of the several acts. It is not possible for want of 
space to set out all these different verses. Only the mantras used in the 
Aa>. gr. are cited in order to convey some idea of the rite as it was 
practised in ancient times. 

601. It appears that originally the father himself performed the 
cutting of the* hair. Some of the grhya sutras like those of Baud, and 
San. nowhere mention the barber in this ceremony. Hence it appears 
that later on the father performed only the homa and repeated the 
mantras, while a barber was employed to shave the boy's head, 'ifa

sake of their long life, with that I shave thy ( head ) for the 
sake of long life, fame and happiness \ The cutting is done a 
third time with the mantra ' with what he may after night ( is 
past ) see the sun again and again, with that I shave thy (head) 
for the sake of long life, fame and happiness \ The cutting is 
done for the fourth time with all the three mantras together. 
Then the hair is cut three times on the left side similarly. The 
edge of the razor is then wiped off with the mantra ' when thou 
shavest as a shaver the hair ( of the boy ) with the razor that 
wounds and is well-shaped purify his head, but do not deprive 
him of life '. Then he gives orders to the barber * doing with 
lukewarm water what has to be done with water, arrange his 
hair ( well ) without causing him ( the boy ) any wound \ Let 
him have the hair of the boy arranged according to the custom 
of the family. The rite only ( without the mantras ) is per- 
formed for a girl. 608 

According to several sutras, the cut hair placed in the dung 
of a bull is buried in a cow stablu 603 or is thrown in a pond or in 
the vicinity of water ( Par., Bhar. ) or is buried at the root of the 
Udumbara tree ( Bhar. ) or in a bunch of darbha grass ( Baud,, 
Bhar., Gobhila) or in the forest (Gobhila). The Manava gr. 
prescribes that as the hair fall down when cut they are gathered 
by some friendly person. The Kathaka gr. and Manava gr. say 
that the barber gets a sesame cake and a fine piece of cloth, 
while Vaik. says food is given to him. A bath for the boy is 
expressly prescribed by Baud, and some others. 

There is a great divergence of views about the number of 
locks of hair to be left on the head and the portion of the head 
where they are to be left. Baud. gr. says that one or three or five 
looks 604 may be left on the head or according to family usage 
and he further says that some sages say that the locks should 



602. All tbe mantras in AaV gr. occur also in Manava gr., some 
occur in Baud., BhaT., Par., and others. The mantras in Adv. viz grwir**

same as 3T*i^ VIII. 2. 17. and Mv. appears to have adapted it pur- 
posely to make it suit the caula.

be as many as the pravaras invoked by the father. 605 A6v. gr., 
and Par. gr.say that looks may be kept according to family usage. 
Ap. gr, says that the locks may in number follow the pravara 
or they may be kept according to family usage. Gobhila and 
Khadira say that the locks should be arranged according to 
gotra and family usage. Whether they mean by ' gotra ' the 
number of pravaras of the gotra or some rule such as the 
Kathaka gives is not clear. The Kathaka gr. says that the 
Vasisthas keep a lock on the right, that persons of Atri and 
Kasyapa gotra ( or pravara ) keep locks both on the right and 
the left, that the Bhrgus shaves the entire head, that the Angiras 
gotra keeps five looks or only a line of hair, while persons of 
other gotras ( like Agastya, Visvamitra &c. ) keep a Sikha 
( without any particular number of locks ) simply because it is 
an auspicious sign or one may follow the usage of one's 606 
family. Vaik. 807 says that the locks may be one, two, three, 
five or seven according to the pravaras. Rgveda 608 VII. 33. 1 
refers to the fact that Vasisthas had a look of hair on the right 
side of the head and so the rule of the Kathaka has a very hoary 
antiquity behind it. Up to modern times one of the characteri- 
stic outward signs of all Hindus was the sikha ( the top-knot ). 
A verse of Devala says that whatever religious act a man does 
without the yajfiopavita or without sikha is as good as undone 
and Harlta rules that a person who cuts off his sikha 
through hate or ignorance or foolishness becomes pure only after 



605. The pravaras or rsis of the seveial gotras arc generally throe

performing the taptakrcchra penance. 609 In the Mudraraksasa (18) 
there is a reference to the 6ikha of Canakya having been kept 
untied when he was angered by the Nandas. Sahara ( on 
Jaimini I. 3. 2) remarks that the sikha (its position and locks) is 
a sign to indicate the gotra and quotes Rg. VI. 75. 17 ( yatra 
banah &c. cited above in note 598 ). Vasistha ( II. 21 ) pres- 
cribes that members of all varnas ( including the 6iidra ) should 
arrange their hair according to the fixed usage (of their family) 
or should shave the whole head except the 6ikha. A Vedic 
passage 610 is * the head that has no 6ikM on it is unholy \ For 
rules about the sikha of students vide later on under upanayana. 
During recent times men, particularly those receiving English 
education in towns and cities, are forsaking the ancient practice 
of keeping a sikha and follow the western method of allowing 
the hair to grow on the whole head. 

In modern times the rite of cudakarana generally takes 
place if at all on the day of Upanayana. 

As v. gr. ( I. 17. 18 ) expressly says that the ceremony of 
cudakarana was to be performed for girls also, but no Vedic 
mantras were to be repeated. Manu ( II. 66 ) says that all the 
ceremonies from jafcakarma to caula must be performed at the 
proper times for girls also in order to purify their bodies but 
without mantras and Yaj. ( I. 13 ) is to the same effect. Even 
such lafce writers as Mitramisra say that the caula of girls may 
be performed according to the usage of the family and that their 
hair may be entirely shaved or a &ikha may be kept or there 
should be no shaving at all. 811 

In some castes even in modern times girls when mere 
children are shaved once, it being supposed that the first hair 
are impure.

between the third year when usually caula was performed and 
the 8th year ( from conception ) when the upanayana usually 
took place ( in the case of br&hmanas ). They state that rarely 
upanayana was performed even in the 5th year ( as will be 
shown hereafter ). Some faint light is thrown on this matter 
by the Arthasastra of Kautilya, 618 which says that the prince 
after the performance of caula is to engage in the study of the 
alphabet and of arithmetic, and after his upanayana he is to 
study the Vedas, anvlksiki ( metaphysics ), varta ( agriculture 
and the science of wealth ) and dandaniti (the art of government) 
up till the 16th year when the godana ceremony is to be 
performed and after which year he may marry. Kalidasa 
also (in Raghuvamsa III. 28) says that prince Aja first mastered 
the alphabet and then entered into the ocean of ( Sanskrit ) liter- 
ature. Bana has 61S probably the Arthasastra in view when he 
makes prince Candraplda enter the temple of learning ( vidya- 
mandira ) at 6 and remain there till he became sixteen and he 
( like Milton in his letter to Harfclile ) tells us how extensive the 
ideal curriculum of studies in arts and sciences for the prince 
was thought to be. In the Uttararamacarita ( Act II ) it is said 
that Kusa and Lava were taught vidyas other than the Veda 
after their caula and before upanayana. 

It appears that at least from the early centuries of the 
Christian era, a ceremony called Vidyarambha ( commencement 
of learning the alphabet ) was celebrated. Apararka (pp. 30-31) 
and the Sm. C. (I. p, 26) cite verses from the Markandeya-purana m

about vidyarambha as follows: in the fifth year of the child 
on some day from the 12th of the bright half of Kartika to 
the 11th of the bright half of Asadha, but excluding the 
1st, 6th, 8th, 15fch tithi or rikta fcifchis ( i. e. 4th, 9th and 14th ) 
and Saturday and Tuesday, the ceremony of beginning to 
learn should be performed. Having worshipped Hari ( Visnu ), 
LaksmJ, SarasvatI, the sutra writers of one's sakha and the lore 
peculiar to one's family, one should offer in the fire oblations of 
clarified butter to the above mentioned deities and should hon- 
our brahmanas by the payment of daksina. The teacher should 
sit facing the east and the boy should face the West and the 
teacher should begin to teach the first lesson to the boy who 
should receive the benedictions of brahmanas. Thereafter 
teaching should be stopped on the days of anadhyaya ( which 
will be specified later on ). 

The Sarhskara-prakasa ( pp. 321-325 ) and Samskararatna- 
mala (pp. 904-907 ) have an extensivo note, a considerable part of 
whioh is devoted to astrological matters. The Sarhskaraprakasa 
quotes passages from Visvamitra, Devala and other sages and 
works that vidy&rambha is performed in the 5th year or in 
any case before upanayana. It also quotes a verse from Nrsimha 
that SarasvatI and Ganapati should be worshipped and then the 
teacher should be honoured. The modern practioe is to begin 
learning the alphabet on an auspicious day, generally the 10th 
of the bright half of Asvina, SarasvatI and Ganapati are wor- 
shipped, the teacher is honoured and the boy is asked to repeat 
the words *om namah siddham' and to write them on a slate and 
then he is taught the letters ( * a \ ' a ' &c.) of the alphabet. The 
Samskararatnamala 615 calls this ceremony Aksarasvlkara (appro- 
priately enough ) and among other texts cites a long prose 
passage from Garga quoted in the Parijata and prescribes a 
homa also with ajyahutis to SarasvatI, Hari, Lakstnl, VighneSa 
( Ganapati ), sutrakaras and one's vidya.

CHAPTER VII 

UPANAYANA 

This word literally means * leading or taking near \ But 
the important question is ' near what ' ? It appears that it 
originally meant ' taking near the acarya ' ( for instruction ) ; 
it may have also meant introducing the' novice to the stage 
of student-hood \ Some of the grhyasutras bring out this sense 
clearly e. g. the Hir. gr. I. 5. 2 616 says "The teacher then makes 
the boy utter * I have come unto brahmacarya. Lead me near 
( initiate me into it ). Let me be a student, impelled by the 
god Savitr ' ". The Manava and Kathaka gr. ( 41. 1 ) also use the 
word upayana for upanayana and Adityadarsana on Kathaka 
gr. ( 41. 1 ) says that upanaya, upanayana, maunjlbandhana, 
batukarana, vratabandha are synonyms. 

A few words about the origin and development of this most 
important samskara would not be out; of place here. Compa- 
rison with the ancient Zoroastrian scriptures ( vide S. B. E. vol. 
V. pp. 285-290 about the sacred girdle and shirt ) and the 
modern practices among the Parsis of India tend to show that 
Upanayana goes back to an Indo-Iranian origin. But that 
subject is outside the scope of this work. Confining ourselves to 
Indian Literature, we find that already in the Rg. X. 109. 5 
the word * brahmacarl ' occurs * oh gods 1 he ( Brhaspati ), all 
pervading one, moves as a brahmacarl pervading all (sacrifices) ; 
he is only one part of the gods ( i. e. of sacrifices ) ; Brhaspati 
secured by that ( i. e. by his service to the gods ) a wife (me who 
am named ) Juhu, who was ( formerly ) taken by Soma \ 617 The

Ch. VII ] Upanayana 269 

word 'upanayana' 618 can be derived and explained in two ways: 
(1) taking (the boy) near the acarya,(2) that rite by which the boy 
is taken to the acarya. The first sense appears to have been the 
original one and when an extensive ritual came to be associated 
with upanayana the second came to be the sense of the word. Such 
an ancient work as the Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 1. 19 says that upanayana 
is a sarhskara ( purifioatory rite ) laid down by revelation for 
him who seeks learning ( i. e. it accepts the second explanation ) 
or this sutra may mean ' it is a sarhskara brought about by 
imparting the 6ruti ( viz. Gayatrl mantra ) to him who seeks 
learning*. This would mean that upanayana principally is 
gayatryupade^a ( the imparting of the sacred Gayatrl mantra ). 
This appears to be suggested by the Vedic passage quoted above 
(p. 154 /. n. 356) 'he created the brahmana with Gayatrl, the 
ksatriya with Tris^ubh, the vaisya with Jagati \ and by 
Katyayana Sraufca 'one should initiate the brahmana with 
Gayatrl'. Jaimini 619 also (in VI. 1.35) propounds the view 
that upanayana is a samskara and has a seen result viz. thereby 
the boy is brought near the teacher for learning Veda. 

Rg. III. 8. 4 68 Â° is a verse that clearly indicates that some 
of the characteristics of upanayana described in the grhya sutras 
were well known even then. There the sacrificial post ( yupa ) 
is praised as a young person ( i. e. in the language of the later 
classical rhetoricians there is the first kind of the figure 
Atisayokti ) ' here comes the youth, well dressed and encircled 
( the boy by his mekhala and the post by its rasana ); he, when 
born, attains eminence j wise sages, full of devotion to the gods 
in their hearts and entertaining happy thoughts, raise him up \ 
Here in ' un-nayanti ' we have the same root that we have in 
upanayana. This mantra is employed in the upanayana by 
several grhya sutras e. g. Asv. I. 20. 8 ( who employs it for

making the boy circumambulate ) and Par. II. 2. ( presoribe 
that the mantra is to be recited when tying the girdle round th 
boy's waist ). In the Tai. S. VI. 681 3. 10. 5 we have the f amou 
passage referring to the three debts where the words 4 brahmacarl 
and ' brahmacarya ' occur. 4 Every brahmana when born i 
indebted in three debts viz. in brahmacarya to the sages, ii 
sacrifice to the gods and in offspring to the manes ; he indee< 
becomes free from debts who has a son, who sacrifices and wh 
dwells ( with the teacher ) as a brahmacarl.' 

In the other Vedas and in the Brahmana literature there i 
ample material to show what the characteristic features o 
upanayana and brahmacarya were. The whole of Atharvavedi 
XL 7 ( 26 verses ) is a hymn containing hyperbolical laudatioi 
of the brahmacarl ( Vedio student ) and brahmacarya. Th 
very first verse 6M may be cited as a sample * The brahmacar 
incessantly covering ( the world by his glory ) roaraB in the tw< 
worlds ; the gods have the same thoughts ( of grace and favour 
about him ; he fills his teacher by his austerities \ Verse 3 say 
1 the teacher leading ( the boy ) near him makes the brahmacar 
like unto a foetus * ( here the word * upanayamanah * occurs ) 
Verse 4 states that the heaven and the earth are the ' samidh 
( the fuel stick ) of the brahmacarl and that the brahmacarl by hi 
mekhala (girdle), by his samidh and by his life of hard work fill 
the world with austerities. Verse 6 tells us that the brahmacar 
wears the skin of a black antelope and has a long beard; verse l; 
says that the brahmacarl offers samidh into fire ( or if fire is no 
available) to the sun, to the moon, to the wind or into waters. Thi 
hymn thus brings out most of the characteristic features of th 
brahmacarl and of upanayana ( viz. deerskin, mekhala, offerinj 
of samidh, begging and a life of hard work and restraint). Fron 
the reference to the beard and from the words * this man ( ayan 
purusah)' occurring in the Atharvaveda VIII. 1. 1 and elsewheri 
it appears probable that upanayana was performed rather late 
in those ancient days than in the days of the sutras.

Ch. Vn 1 Upanayam Wl 

In the Tai. Br. III. 883 10. 11 there is the story of Bharadvaja 
who remained a brahmacarl for three parts of his life ( i. e. till 
75 ) and to whom Indra said that in all that long period of 
brahmacarya he had mastered only an insignificant portion 
( three handfuls out of three mountains ) of the Vedas, which 
were endless in extent. The story of Nabhanedistha, son of 
Manu, who was excluded from ancestral property at a partition 
made by his brothers, narrated in the Ait. Br. shows 684 that he 
was a brahmacarl staying with a teacher away from his father's 
place. The Sat. Br. XL 5. 4. contains many and almost 
complete details about the life of brahmacarins which bear a 
very close similarity to those taught in the grhya sutras. A 
brief summary is set out below. The boy says ' I have come 
unto brahmacarya * and ' let me be a brahmacarl '. Then the 
teacher asks him ' what is your name ' ; then the teacher takes 
him near ( upanayati ) ; the teacher takes hold of the boy's hand 
with the words ' you are the brahmacarl of Indra ; Agni is your 
teacher, I am your teacher, N. N. ( addressing the boy by his 
name) 1 . Then he consigns the boy to (the care of) the ele- 
ments. The teacher instructs him * drink water, do work ( in 
the teacher's house ), put a fuel stick ( on the fire ), do not sleep 
( by day ).' He repeats the Savifcrl ( mantra sacred to Savitr ). 
Formerly it was repeated a year ( after the boy came as a 
brahmacarl ), then at the end of six months, 24 days, 12 days, 3 
days ; but one should repeat to the brahman** boy the verse at 
once ( on the very day of upanayana ); the teacher repeats it to 
him first each pada separately, then the half and then the whole. 
Being a brahmacarl one should not eat honey. 685

The word ' antevasl * ( lit one who dwells near a teacher ) 
occurs in the Sat. Br. V. 1. 5. 17 and in the Tai. Up. 1. 11. The 
Sat. Br. (XL 3. 3. 2) says 626 'he who takes to brahmacarya indeed 
takes upon himself a sacrificial session of long duration. ' It 
further says ( XL 3. 3. 3-6 ) that the boy when entering upon 
studenthood approaches giving a fourth part of himself to Agni, 
Death, the teacher and himself and that by the offering of 
samidh ( to fire ), by begging and by doing work in the teacher's 
house respectively he secures freedom from the action of the 
first three. It also says that after one finishes studenthood and 
takes the ceremonial bath one should not beg. Vide Gopatha 
Br. ( ed. by Gasfcra ) 2. 3 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 53. The Sat. Br. 
( III. 6. 2. 15 ) further says ' therefore brahmacarins protect the 
teacher, his house and his cattle, with the idea that otherwise he 
might be taken away from them \ 627 

Janamejaya Pariksita asks the hamsas ( who were the 
Ahavanlya and Daksina fires ) ' what is holy ' and the latter 
reply 'It is brahmacarya ' (vide Gopatha Br. 2. 5). Gopatha (2. 5) 
further says * the period of studenthood for the mastery of all 
Vedas is 48 years, which, being distributed among the Vedas in 
four parts, makes brahmacarya last for 12 years, which is the 
lowest limit; one should practise brahmacarya according to one's 
ability before taking the ceremonial 628 bath/ The same work says 
that the brahmacarl should fetch samidhs every day for worship- 
ping fire and beg and that if he does not do so continuously for 
seven days he has to undergo upanayana again ( 2. 6 ) and that 
the lady of the house should daily give alms to a brahmacarin 
with the idea that he may not deprive her of her wealth, of 
merit due to istapurta. It also says that a brahmacarl should 
not sleep on a cot, should not engage in singing and dancing, 
should not roam about, should not spit about nor go 
to a cemetery. 629

Ch. VII ] Upanayana 27ff 

It appears from the above and from the Upanisad passages 
set out immediately below that originally Upanayana was a very 
simple matter. The would-be student came to the teacher with 
a aamidh in his hand and told the teacher that he desired to enter 
the stage of studenthood and begged to be allowed to be a 
brahroacarl living with the teacher. There were no elaborate 
ceremonies like those described in the grhya sutras. The word 
brahmacarya occurs in the Katha. Up. 1. 1.15, Mundaka II. 1. 7, 
Chandogya VI. 1. 1 and other Upanisads. The Chandogya 
and the Br. Up., probably the oldest among the Upanisads, 
furnish very valuable information. That some ceremonies were 
required before a young boy was admitted as a student even in 
Upanisadic times is clear from the statement in the Chandogya 
V. 11. 7 e3 Â° that when Asvapati Kekaya was approached by 
Praclna6ala Aupamanyava and four others who carried fuel in 
their hands (like young students) and who were grown-up 
householders and theologians, * he ( Asvapati ) without submit- 
ting them to the rites of Upanayana began the discourse*. When 
Satyakama 631 Jabala tells the truth about his gotra to Gautama 
Haridrumata, the latter says 'fetch, dear boy, fuel, I shall 
initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth * ( Chando- 
gya IV. 4. 5 ). Similarly in the Br. Up. VI. 2. 7. it is said that 
former students ( i. e. students in former ages ) approached ( the 
teacher for brahmacarya ) only in words ( i. e. without any 
further solemn rite or ceremony ). 63a In the most ancient times 
it is probable that the father himself always taught his son. 6SSI 
But it appears that from the times of the Tai. S. and the 
Brahmanas the student generally went to a guru and stayed in 
his house ( vide note 624 about Nabhanedis^ha ). Uddalaka 
Arum who was himself a profound philosopher of brahma asks 
his son Svetaketu to enter upon brahmacarya and sends him to a 
teacher to learn the Vedas. 63 * The same Upanisad describes the

airama of brahmacarya ' dwelling as a brahmacarl in the house 
of a teacher, mortifying his body in the house of his teacher 
till his m end \ Chandogya IV. 4. 4. shows that the teacher 
asked the pupil his gotra ( in order that he may address him by 
that name )â¢ The same Upanisad shows that the brahmacarl had 
to beg for food ( IV. 3. 5 ), that he had to look after the fire of his 
teacher (IV. 10. 1-2) and that he had to tend his cattle (IV. 4. 5). 
The age when upanayana was performed is not expressly stated 
in the Upanisads except in the case of Svetaketu who was 12 
( vide note 634 above ). The period of student-hood was usually 
twelve (Chandogya II. 23.1, IV. 10.1, VL1.2), though the Chando- 
gya ( VIII. 11. 3 ) speaks of Indra's brahmacarya for 101 years 
and Chandogya II. 23. 1; speaks of brahmacarya for life. 

We shall now turn to upanayana as described in the sutras 
and smrtis. The following matters fall to be treated under 
Upanayana : The proper age for upanayana, the auspicious 
seasons for it ; the skin, the garments, the girdle and the staff 
for the brahmacarins of different varnas ; the yajiiopavlta ; the 
preliminaries of upanayana, such as homa, taking of curds by 
the boy, afijalipurana, asmarohana; the principal rites of 
upanayana viz. taking of the student's hand by the teacher* 
touching the chest of the student expressive of acceptance as 
pupil, handing the boy to Savitr and other gods (paridana), 
instruction in the duties of the student ( such as putting fuel on 
fire, begging &o. ), instruction in the famous Savitrl mantra ; 
medhajanana ; study of the Vedas and daily recitation of Vedic 
texts ; special vratas of the brahmacarl ; Patitasavitrika ( those 
whose upanayana has not been performed at all ) and rules 
about them. These matters will now be dealt with in order. It 
should be remembered that all these matters are not dwelt upon 
by all the smrtis nor are they treated of in the same order. 
Further the Vedic mantras often differ in the different sutras. 

The proper age for Upanayana y 

TheA6v. gr. 636 (I. 19. 1-6) says that a brahmana boy 
should undergo upanayana in the eighth year from birth or 
from conception, a ksatriya in the 11th year, a vai&ya in the

12th and thai; to the 16th, 22nd and 24th years respectively for the 
three varnas it cannot be said that the time for upanayana has 
passed. Ap. 687 ( 10. 2 ), San. ( II. 1 ), Baud. ( II. 5. 2 ) and Bhar. 
(1. 1), Gobhila (II. 10. 1) grhya sutras, Yaj. 1. 14, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 
1. 19 expressly say that the respective years are calculated from 
conception. ( The Mahabhasya 6JB also refers to the rule that a 
brahmana's upanayana is to be performed in the 8th yearfrom 
conception. Par. 659 gr. ( II. 2 ) allows upanayana in the 8th 
year from birth or conception and adds that in the case of all 
varnas family usage may be followed. Yaj. 1. 14 also refers to 
family usage. San. gr. ( II. 1. 1 ) allows upanayana in the 8th 
or 10th year from conception, the Manava gr. ( I. 22. 1 ) allows 
it; in the 7th or 9fch year, the Kathaka gr. ( 41. 1-3 ) prescribes 
7th, 9th and 11th years for the upanayana of the three varnas 
respectively. In some smrfcis upanayana is allowed to be 
performed even earlier or at different ages, e. g. Gautama (I. 6-8) 
prescribes that upanayana for a brahmana is in the 8th year 
from conception but it may be in the 5th or 9th according to the 
result desired ; and Manu. II. 37 says that if spiritual eminence 
( for the boy ) is desired ( by his father ) then upanayana may 
be performed in the 5th year for a brahmana, in the 6th year for 
a ksatriya if there is a desire for military power, in the 8th for 
a vaisya if there is desire for endeavour to accumulate wealth. 
Vaik. ( II. 3 ) also prescribes the 5th, 8th, 9th years from con- 
ception for a brahmana if there is a desire respectively for

It should be noticed that in the Atharvaveda XI. 7. 3., snrrsj XI. 5. 4. 1,

spiritual eminence, long life and wealth. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 
1. 21 and Baud. gr. (II. 5) prescribe 7th, 8fch, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th 
years respectively for one desiring spiritual eminence, long life, 
brilliance, abundant food, physical vigour and cattle. 

Therefore, the 8th, 11th" and 12th years from birth forjhe three 
varnas are the principal time for upanayana ; while the years 
from 5th onwards up to 11th are the secondary time ( gauna ) 
for a brahmana, 9th to 16th are secondary for ksatriya and so 
on. From 12th to 16 is gawn.atara for brahmanas and after 16 
gaunatama for them. Vide Samskara-prakasa p. 342. 

The auspicious times according to the Ap. gi\ and Ap. Dh. 
S. 1. 1. 1. 19, Hir. gr. ( I. 1 ) and Vaik. are vasanta ( spring ), 
grlsma ( summer ), and sarad ( autumn ) for the tliree varr/as. 
The Bhar. gr. ( I. 1 ) says that upanayana for a brahmana 
should be performed in vasanta, for a ksatriya in summer or 
hemanta, for a vaisya in sarad, in the rains for a carpenter 
( rathakara ) or in sisira for all. Sahara in his bhasya on 
Jaimini VI. 1. 33 where upanayana is denied to &udras quotes 
' vasante brahmanam upanaylfca ' as a Vedic text. Asv. gr. I. 4. 1 
(quoted above in /. n. 494), Hir. gr. (I. 1. 5, S. B. E. 
vol. 30 p.l 37 ) and Bhar. gr. ( 1. 1 ) say that upanayana 
should be performed in the bright half of a month, on an 
auspicious naksatra, particularly under a naksatra the name of 
which is masculine. 640 

Later works introduced very intricate rules about the 
proper months, tithis, days and times for upanayana. It is neither 
possible nor very necessary to go into these astrological details. 
But a few words must be said as in modern times upanayana is 
performed only in accordance with these rules. Vrddhagargya* 41 
laid down that six months from Magha were the proper months 
fqr upanayana, while others say that five months from Magha 
are the proper ones. Then 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, 14th, 15th 
i. e. ( full moon and new moon ) tithis are generally ayoided 
( though there are some counter exceptions which are not set out 
here ). It is stated that upanayana should not be performed 
when Venus is so near the sun that it cannot be seen, when the 
sun is in the first degree of any zodiacal sign, on anadhyaya

days and on galagraha m ( the tithis specified above ). Jupiter, 
Venus, Mars 6 * 3 and Mercury are respectively the presiding deities 
of the Rgveda and the other Vedas. Therefore the upanayana 
of those who have to study these Vedas should be performed on 
the week days presided over by these planets. Among week days 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best, Sunday is mid- 
dling, Monday isthe least suitable, but Tuesday and Saturday are 
prohibited (except that for students of the Samaveda and ksatriyas 
Tuesday is allowed ). Among the naksatras 644 the proper ones 
are Hasta, Citra, Svati, Pusya, Dhanistha, AsvinI, Mrga^iras, 
Punarvasu, Sravana and Revatl. There are other rules about 
naksatras with respect to those who follow a particular Veda 
( which are^ passed over ). One rule is that all naksatras except 
BharanI, Krttika, Magha, Vi&akha, Jyestha, Satataraka are good 
for all. The Moon and Jupiter must be astrologically strong with 
reference to the boy's horoscope. The rule about Jupiter probably 
arose from the fact that Jupiter was supposed to rule over 
knowledge and happiness and as upanayana was meant to be 
the entrance for Veda*study, Jupiter's benevolent aspect was 
thought to be necessary. If Jupiter and Venus are not to be 
seen owing to nearness to the sun, upanayana cannot be per- 
formed. Jupiter when in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th zodiacal 
sign from the sign of birth ( calculation to be made inclusive of 
the sign of birth ) is auspicious, when in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th 
place from the sign of birth it is auspicious after the performance 
of a propitiatory homa and when it is in the 4th, 8th, 12th plaoe 
from birth, it is inauspicious. The moon is supposed to be 
malefic when she is in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th or 12th place 
from the sign of birth. Four hours from sunrise is the best for 
upanayana, from that time to noon is middling and afternoon is 
prohibited. Some said that a person's upanayana should not be 
performed in the month in which he was born, others restricted 
the prohibition to the paksa ( the half ) of the month in which he 
was born. There are other rules about the Lagna ( the rising

Vyatlpata, Vaidhrti &c. For detailed rules on these, works like 
the Sam. Pr. ( pp. 355-385 ), Nirnayasindhu and Dharmasindhu 
may be consulted. 

For persons who are entitled to perform the upanayana of a 
boy, vide note 480. 

A brahmacarl had to wear two garments, one for the lower 
part of the body (vasas), another for covering the upper part of the 
body (uttarlya). Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1. 2. 39-1. 1. 3. 1-2) says that * the 
garment 645 (vasas) for a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya brahmacarl 
is respectively to be made of hemp, flax, ajina ( deerskin ), some 
teachers prescribe that the lower garment should be* of cotton 
but coloured reddish-yellow for brahraanas; dyed with madder for 
ksatriyas, dyed with turmeric for vaisyas.' Par. gr. (II. 5), Manu 
( II. 41 ) speak of ' avika ' ( made of wool ) for vaisya instead of 
'ajina*. Vas. Dh. S. (XL 64-67) says that a brahmana (brahmacarl) 
should wear a (lower) garment which is white and unblemished 
(or new) and for a ksatriya or vaisya it should be the same as in 
Ap. Dh., but for vaisya Vas. prescribes also one made of kusa 
grass or he says that all should wear cotton cloth that is undyed.' 
Gaut ( 1. 17-20 ) on the other hand says 4 for all the lower gar- 
ment may be made of hemp, flax or kusa grass ( cira ) or of the 
hair of the mountainous goat ( kutapa ) ; other teachers prescribe 
coloured garments, one coloured with the juice of trees for 
brahmanas and madder-red and yellow for ksatriya and vaisya. 
Asv. gr.'(1. 19. 8), Par. gr. (II. 5), Vas. Dh. S. (XI. 61-63), Baud, 
gr. ( II. 5. 16 ) say that the upper garment for a brahmana should 
be the skin of a black deer, for ksatriya the skin of ruru deer and 
for a vaisya of cow-skin or of goat skin. Baud, and Asv. pres- 
cribe only goat skin. Par. gr. adds that if any one cannot secure 
a skin suited to one's varna, he may wear an upper garment 
of cow-hide as the cow is the chief among animals. 848 Baud. gr. 
II. 5. 16 prescribes the skin of black deer for all in the same

circumstances. Ap. Dh. S. ( 1. 1. 3. 7-8 ) gives the option to all 
varnas to use a sheep skin ( as upper garment ) or a woollen 
plaid ( kambala ). &hr. gr. ( 1. 19. 8-9) appears to suggest that the 
lower and upper garments may be of the same skin or that the 
lower garment may be white or coloured ( as stated above by 
Ap. Dh. S.). The Kanaka gr. 647 ( 41. 13 ) says that the upper 
garment for the three varnas should be respectively of the skins 
of black deer, tiger and ruru deer. A vestige of these rules 
survives in the modern practice of tying a small piece of deer 
skin to the yajnopavlta of the boy when his upanayana is 
performed. 

That the rules about the lower and upper garments go back 
to great antiquity is shown by a reference to a Brahmana 
passage in the Ap. Dh. S. 648 1. 1. 3. 9 'one should wear only deer- 
skin ( as lower and upper garments ) if one desires the increase 
of Vedic lore, only ( cotton ) garments if one desires the increase 
of martial valour and both if one desires both \ 

Darifa (staff). â There is some divergence of view about 
the trees of which the staff was to be made. Asv. gr. ( I. 19. 13 
and I. 20. 1 ) says ' a staff of the palaSa wood for a brahmana, 
of udumbara for a ksatriya and of bilva for a vateya or all the 
varnas may employ a staff of any of these trees.' The Ap. gr. 11. 
15-16 (this is the same as Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 2. 38) says that the staff 
should be of palasa wood for a brahmana, of the branch of the 
nyagrodha tree ( so that the downward end of the branch forms 
the tip of the staff) for a ksatriya, of badara or udumbara wood 
for a vaiSya ; while some teachers say that the staff should be 
made of a tree ( which is used in sacrifices ) without reference 
to any varna. Gaut. ( I. 21 ) and Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 5. 17 ) say 
that the staff of palasa or bilva should be used for brahmana and 
Gaut, ( I. 22-23 ) says thab asvattha and pllu wood staff should 
be used respectively for ksatriya and vaisya or of any sacrificial 
tree for all varnas. Baud. gr. prescribes nyagrodha or rauhitaka 
for ksatriya, and badara or udumbara for vaiSya. Par. gr.

( IL 5 ) recommends a staff of pala&a, bilva and udumbara 
respectively for the three varnas ( or any of these for all ). 
Kanaka gr.(41. 22) recommends pala&a, aSvattha and nyagrodha 
respectively for the three. Manu (11.45) prescribes bilva and 
pala^a for brahmana, vafa and khadira for ksatriya, pllu and 
udumbara for vateya, and Kulluka adds that two staffs should 
be used by the boy, as two are recommended in a compound. 

The staff was required for support, for controlling the 
cattle of the teacher ( which the student was to tend ), for protec- 
tion when going out at night and for guidance when entering 
a river or the like. 649 

The length of the staff varied according to the varna of the 
boy. 5iv. gr. L 19. 13, Gaut. I. 25, Vas. Dh. S. ( XL 55-57 ), 
Par. gr. ( II. 5 ), Manu ( II. 46 ) prescribe that in the case of the 
brahmana, ksatriya or vai&ya boy respectively the staff 
should be as high as his head, forehead or the tip of the nose. 
The San. gr. ( II. 1. 21-23, S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 260 ) on the other 
hand reverses this ( the brahmana having the shortest staff and 
the vai6ya the longest ). Gaut. I. 26 says that the staff should 
be one not eaten by worms, should have the bark attached to it, 
and should have a curved tip, while Manu II. 47 adds that the staff 
should be straight, pleasing to look at and should not have come 
into contact with fire. The San. gr. (II. 13. 2-3) prescribes that 
the brahmacarl should not allow any one to pass between himself 
and his staff and that if the staff, girdle or the yajnopavlta break 
or rend, he has to undergo a penance ( same as the one for the 
breaking of a chariot at a wedding procession ) and that at the 
end of the period of brahmacarya, he should sacrifice in water 
the yajnopavlta, staff, the girdle and the skin 65 Â° with a mantra 
to Varuna ( Rg. I. 24. 6 ) or with the sacred syllable ' om \ 
Manu II. 64 and Visnu Dh. S. ( 27. 29 ) say the same thing.

be made of ku&a, asmantaka and balvaja grass ( for brahmana, 
ksatriya and vaisiya ). Manu (II. 42-43) gives the same rules as 
Par. gr. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1.2. 35-37) 65! optionally allows a girdle of 
munja grass with an iron piece intertwined in it for k$atriyaa 
and woollen string or the yoke-string or a string of tamala bark 
for vaisyas ( according to some ). Baud. gr. ( II. 5. 13 ) allows 
mauiijl girdle also fco all. Some of the sutras ( e. g. Baud, gr., 
Ap. Dh. S.) further prescribe that the girdle of munja grass should 
have three strings to it and the grass should have its ends turned 
to the right and the knot of the girdle should be brought 
near the navel. Manu ( II. 43 ) says that there may be one knot 
or three or five (according to family usage, says Kulluka ). 6 * 2 

In order to convey an idea of the rites of upanayana in the 
days of the grhya sutras the ceremony as contained in the A6v. 
gr. sutra ( which is among the shortest ) is set out in full.'** 
* Let him initiate the boy who is decked, whose hair ( on the 
head ) is shaved ( and arranged ), who wears a new garment or 
an antelope skin if a brahmana, ruru skin if a ksatriya, goat's 
skin if a vateya ; if they put on garments they should put on dyed 
ones, reddish-yellow, red and yellow ( for a brahmana, ksatriya, 
vai6ya respectively ), they should have girdles and staffs ( as 
described above ). While the boy takes hold of ( the hand of ) 
his* teacher, the latter offers ( a homa of clarified butter oblations ) 
in the fire ( as described above ) and seats himself to the north of 
the fire with his face turned to the east, while the other one ( the 
boy ) stations himself in front ( of the teacher ) with his face 
turned to the west. The teacher then fills the folded hands of 
both himself and of the boy with water and with the verse * we 
choose that of Savifcr ' ( Rg. V. 82. 1 ) the teacher drops down the 
water in his own folded hinds on fco fche water in the folded

with his own hand the boy's hand together with the thumb ( of 
the boy) with the formula 'by the urge (or order) of the god Savitr, 
with the arms of the two A6vins, with the hands of Pusan, I Beize 
thy hand, oh 1 so and so 'j 653 a with the words * Savitr has seized thy 
hand, oh so and so' a second time ( the teacher seizes the boy's 
hand ) ; with the words * Agni is thy teaoher, oh so and so ' a 
third time. The teacher should cause ( the boy ) to look at the 
sun, while the teacher repeats ' God Savitr ! this is thy 
brahmacarl, protect him, may he not die ' 654 and ( the teacher 
should further ) say ' Whose brahmacarl art thou ? thou art the 
brahmacarl of Prana. Who does initiate thee and whom ( does 
he initiate ) ? I give 655 thee to Ka ( to Prajapati ) '. With the 
half verse ( Rg. Ill 8. 4. ) * the young man, well attired and 
dressed, came 656 hither * he ( the teacher ) should cause him to 
turn round to the right and with his two hands placed over (the 
boy's ) shoulders he should touch the place of the boy's heait 
repeating the latter half ( of Rg. III. 8. 4 ). Having wiped the 
ground round the fire the brahmacarl should put ( on the fire ) a 
fuel stick silently, since it is known (from 6ruti) ' what belongs 
to Prajapati is silently ( done ) ', and the brahmacarl belongs to 
Prajapati. Some do this (offering of a fuel stick) with a mantra 
1 to Agni I have brought a fuel stick, to the great Jatavedas ;

insight, offspring and radiance ; what thy lustre is, Oh Agni f

may I thereby become strong ; what thy consuming power is 
Agni, may I thereby acquire consuming power'. 658 Having 
waited upon (worshipped) Agni with these formulas, (the student) 
should bend his knees, embrace (the teacher's feet) and say to 
him * recite, Sir, recite, Sir, the Savitrl \ Seizing the student's 
hands with the upper garment (of the student) and his own hands 
the teacher recites the Savitrl, first pada by pada, then hemistich

make him ( the student ) recite ( the Savitrl ) as much as he is

with the fingers upturned with the formula *I place thy heart 85 * 
unto duty to me ; may thy mind follow my mind ; may you 
attend on my words single-minded ; may Brhaspati appoint thee 
unto me'. Having tied the girdle round him (the boy) and 
having given him the staff, the teacher should instruct him in

of interest and divergence may be noted here briefly. It is 
remarkable that Asv., Ap. and several other sutrakaras do not 
say a word about the sacred thread, while a few like Hir. gr. 
( I. 2. 6 ) t Bhar. gr. ( I. 3 ) and Manava gr. ( I. 22. % ) say that the 
boy already wears the yajnopavlta before the homa begins ; 
while Baud, gr. 662 ( II. 5. 7 ) says that the boy is given the 
yajnopavlta and then made to recite the well-known mantra 
' the Yajnopavlta is extremely saored ' and the Vaik. smarta 
( II. 5 ) says that the teacher gives the upper garment to the boy 
with M * the verse ' parldam vasah \ the sacred thread with the 
mantra ' Yajnopavltam ' and the black antelope skin with the 
mantra ' the eye of Mitra \ Sudarsana on Ap. gr. 10. 5 says that 
the boy puts on the yajnopavlta with the mantra before he takes 
his meal ( according to some) or (according to others) before 864 he 
puts the fuel stick on the fire and relies on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 
for support. According to Karka and Harihara ( on Paraskara ) 
the yajfiopavlfca was given to the student by the teacher after the 
tying of the girdle. The Samskaratattva p. 934 says the same. 
Late works like the Samskararatnamala ( p. 202 ) prescribe the 
wearing of the sacred thread before the homa. The origin and 
development of the ideas about yajnopavlta will be dealt with 
separately later on. Ap. gr. ( X. 5 ), Baud gr. ( II. 5. 7 ) and 
Par. gr. (II. 2 ) prescribe a dinner to brahmanas before the 
ceremonies begin and receiving their benedictions. Ap. gr. 
( X. 5 ), Bhar. gr. ( I. 1 ), Baud gr. m ( II. 5. 7 ) say that the boy 
also is made to take food ; according to later works ( e. gÂ» 
Samskararatnamala ) the boy takes his meal in the same dish 
with his mother (for the last time) and other brahmacarins (eight 
in number ) are also invited at the same time for meals in the

company of the boy. This practice is observed even in modern 
times. Almost all prescribe that the boy is shaved on this day 
(asincaula); this also is done in modern times. But in 
ancient 8<58 times the ehaving was done by the acarya himself as 
stated by Sudar^ana on Ap. gr. 10. 6-8. There are several other 
matters detailed in Ap. and others, on which A6v. and some 
others are silent. The important ones are mentioned below. 

(a) Ap. gr. (10.9), Manava gr. (1.23.12), Baud. gr. 
(II. 5, 10), Khadira gr. ( II. 4 ) and Bhar. gy. ( I. 8 ) make the boy 
tread on a stone to the north of the fire with his right foot after 
homa. The mantras repeated in the several sutras are significant 
asking the boy to be firm like a stone. 667 

(b) Manava gr. (1.22.3) and Kathaka gr. (41. 10) prescribe 
after homa the tasting of curds thrice after repeating the verse 
1 Dadhikravno akarisam ' ( Rg. IV. 39. 6 = Tai. S. I. 5. 4. 11 ). 

(c) Par. gr. ( II. 2 ), Bhar. gr. (1. 7), Ap. gf. ( 11. 1-4 ), Ap. 
Mantrapa^ha (II. 3. 27-30), Baud. gr. II. 5. 25 ( quoting Sa^ya- 
yanaka ), Manava gr. I. 22. 4-5, and Khadira gr. II. 4. 12 refer 
to the fact that the teacher asks the boy his name and the latter 
pronounces his name. The teaoher also asks whose brahmacarl 
the boy is. 

A person was given ( as shown above at pp. 246-247 ) 
an abhivadanlya name either derived from the naksatra of 
birth or from a deity name or the gotra name. This was 
necessary for several purposes. The teaoher had to know that 
the boy came from a good family, he had also to address him 
by name ( as there might be several pupils ). It is wrong to 
suppose e68 from the story of Satyakaraa Jabala ( where the

teacher asked him his gotra ) that only brahmanas were admitted 
to brahmaoarya. All smrtis, even the latest, contemplated that 
the three castes had the right to learn the Veda. It is one thing 
to have a right and another to exercise it. Probably very few 
ksatriyas oared to submit their sons to the rigorous discipline 
of brahmacarya as laid down in the smrtis and cared much less 
for Veda studies. In the Mahabharata and in the Kadambarl 
it is said that the princes were taught in a special house con- 
structed for the purpose and teachers were paid handsomely 
and brought there to teach instead of the princes going to the 
teachers. 

It is not possible for want of spaoe to show how the great- 
est possible confusion prevails as to the order of the various 
components of the ceremony of upanayana, But a few striking 
examples may be given. Asvalayana gr. treats of the tying of 
the girdle and the giving of the staff almost at the end of the 
ceremony, while Ap. gr. puts this after horaa and immediately 
before anjalipurana ( filling the folded hands of both with 
water ) ; Asvalayana puts adityadarsana after the boy's band is 
held by the teacher and before paridana ( handing the boy over 
to the deities ), but Bhar. ( I. 9 ) puts it after the instruction in 
the observances of brahmacarya. The Bhar. gr. ( I. 9 ) treats 
of adityadarsana almost at the end of the rites, while,. Asv. 
places it among the earlier ones after homa. Besides the same 
mantras are employed by different sutras for different purposes; 
for example, the mantra ' susravah &c.' is employed by Ap. at 
the time of taking the staff by the boy ( XL 14 and Mantrapatha 
II. 5. 1 ), while Asv. gr. ( I. 22. 19 ), Bhar. gr. ( I. 10 ), Manava gr. 
( I. 23, 17 ) employ it in c medhajanana * ( on the 4th day after 
upanayana ) and Par. gr. (II. 4) employs it at the time of putting 
a fuel stick on fire. Asv. employs the verse ' yuva suvasfih ' 
( Rg. III. 8. 4 ) for making the boy turn round ( first half ) and 
for touching the region of the boy's heart ( latter half ), while 
the same verse is employed at the time of tying the girdle 
round the boy's waist by the Manava gr. (1.22.8) and Par. 
gr.(IL2). 

Later writers went on adding mantras and details. On 
the day prior to upanayana the Nandlsraddha was performed as 
said by Haradatta on Ap. gr. 10. 5. Grahamakha ( a sacrifice to 
the planets ) also may be performed the previous day or on any 
day within 7 or 10 days of the upanayana. Then before the 
actual upanayana, there is the worship of Ganapati and of 



Ch. VII ] Procedure of Upanayara 287 

KuladevatSs, punyahavacana, the worship of Mates and the 
consecration of the mandapa-devatas. For the detailed modern 
procedure ( prayoga ) of upanayana, the S. R. M. ( pp. 197-210 ), 
which in the main follows the briefer procedure in the grhya 
sutras, may be consulted. Up to the act of making the boy 
dine with his mother it is the father who does everything ; 
thereafter it is the acarya who does the rest. The samkalpa 
of upanayana is given below 669 . 

Yajflopavita* 10 :â A few words must be said on the history of 
yajilopavita from ancient times. Among the earliest references is 
one from the Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 1 * the nivlta 871 is (used in actions) 
for men, the praclnavlta ( is used in rites ) for pitrs, the upavlta 
(in rites ) for gods ; he wears it in the upavlta mode (i. e. slung 
from the left shoulder ), thereby he makes a distinguishing 
sign of the gods'. In the Tai. Br. (I. 6. 8.) we read l wearing in the 
praclnavlta form he offers towards the south; for in the case of 
pitrs, acts are performed towards the south. Disregarding that 
one should wear in the upavlta form and offer in the north only, 
since both gods and pitrs are worshipped (in this rite) \ 878 The 
three words nivlta, praclnavlta and upavlta are explained in the 
Gobhila gr. (I. 2. 2-4) which says * raising his right arm,putting 
the head into ( the upavlta ) he suspends ( the cord ) over his left 
shou^er in such a way that it hangs down, on his right side ; 
thus lie becomes yajnopavltin- Passing his left arm, putting 
the head ( into the upavlta ) he suspends it over his right 
shoulder, so that it hangs down along his left side ; in this way 
he becomes pr&clnavltin ; a person becomes praclnavltin only 
in the sacrifice offered to the Manes' C7S . To the same effect is

Khadira gr. 1. 1. 8-9, Manu II. 63, Baud. gr. paribhfisS-sutra II. 
2. 7 and 10, Vaik. I. 5. The Baud/ 74 gr. paribhasa-sutra II. 2. 3 
says ' when it is carried over the neck, both shoulders and the 
ohest and is held with both the thumbs ( of the two hands ) 
lower than the region of the heart and above the navel, that is 
nivita ; (when the sruti says it is) for men, what it means is that 
it is for sages. The occasions when nivita mode is used are : 
rsi-tarpana, sexual intercourse, samskaras of one's children 
except when homa is to be performed, answering the calls of 
nature, carrying a corpse and whatever other actions are meant 
only for men ; nivlfca is what hangs from the neck \ 

The Sat. Br. ( II. 4. 2. 1, S. B. E. vol. 12, p. 361 ) says " the 
gods being yajnopavltins approached near, bending their right 
knee ; he ( Prajapati ) said to them * the sacrifice is your 
food, immortality is your strength, the sun is your light ' ; then 
the pitrs approached him, being praclnavltins and bending their 
left knee and then men approached him covered with a garment 
and bending their bodies" etc/ 75 It is important to note 
here that men are said to have been covered only with a garment 
and there is no reference in their case to any mode of wearing 
either as yajnopavlta or nivlfea or praclnavlta. This rather 
suggests that men wore only garments when approaching gods 
and not necessarily a cord of threads. In the Tai. 678 Br. III. 10. 9. 
it is said that when vak ( speech ) appeared to Devabhaga 
Gautama he put on the yajfiopavlta and fell down with the 
words * namo namah \ 

It seems to follow from a passage in the Tai. A. ( II. 1 ) 
that a strip of black antelope skin or of cloth was used in 
ancient times as upavlta 877 ' the sacrifice of him who wears the

yajnopavlta becomes spread out ( prosperous, famous ), while the 
sacrifice of him who does not wear it does not spread ; whatever 
a brahmana studies, wearing a yajnopavlta, he really ( therein ) 
performs a sacrifice. Therefore one should study, sacrifice or 
officiate at a sacrifice wifch the yajnopavlta on for securing the 
spreading of sacrifice ; having worn an antelope skin or a 
garment on the right side, he raises the right hand and keeps 
the left down ; this is yajnopavlta; when this position is reversed 
it is praclnavlta ; the position called samvlta is for men.' It is 
remarkable that here at any rate no cord of threads is meant by 
upavlta, but only a piece of skin or cloth. The Par. M. 
( I. part 1 p. 173 ) quotes 878 a portion of the above passage 
and remarks that the Tai. Ar. lays down that a man becomes 
ah upavltin by wearing one of the two, viz. antelope skin and 
( cotton ) garment. 

In the PurvamIniamsasutra(III. 1. 21) it is established (with 
reference to the words) in the Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 1 (upavyayate etc. 
quoted in/, n. 671) that one has to be an upavltin throughout all 
the actions, prescribed in the sections on the Darsa-Purnamasa 
sacrifice and not only when the SamidhenI verses are recited. 
The first part of the same passage is discussed by Jaimini ( III. 

4. 1-9 ) and it is established that the passage enjoins the wearing 
of upavlta in Darsa-Purnamasa which is devakarma and that the 
reference to praclnavlta and nivlta is only an anuvcida intended 
to emphasize the desirability of the wearing of upavlta in sacri- 
fices to gods. The Tantravartika 679 explains that nivita is tying 
the upavlta round the throat like a braid of hair (according to 
some), while according to others it is tying it round the waist as 
if for girding up the loins and that the first is not done except in 
battle, while the latter has to be resorted to in all acts in order to 
devote sole attention to them. So according to the Tantravartika, 
the Tai. S. is not referring (in II. 5. 11. 1) to a cord of threads but to 
a piece of cloth. Some of the sutrakaras and commentators drop 
hints that garments were used or could bemused as upavlta. Ap. Dh. 

5. ( II. 2. 4. 22-23 ) says that a householder should always wear 
an upper garment and then adds ' or the sacred thread may serve 
the purpose of an upper garment. ' This shows that originally

upavlta meant an upper garment and not merely a cord of 
threads. In another place the same sutra says (II. 8.19.12) 
â¢ one ( who partakes of sraddha dinner) should eat covered with 
an upper garment slung over the left shoulder and passing under 
the right arm \ Haradatta gives two explanations of this, viz, 
that one should wear an upper garment ( while dining at a 
sraddha) like a yajnopavlta i. e. under the right arm and 
over the left shoulder, that is, a brahmana cannot rely on 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4. 23 and wear at sraddha repast only the 
sacred thread ( but he must wear the garment in that fashion) 
and give up the sacred thread for the time. 68 Â° While another 
view is that he must wear the sacred thread and the upper gar- 
ment both in the fashion of upavlta. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 2. 6. 18-19 ) 
prescribes that when a student wears two garments he should 
wear one of them ( i, e. the upper one ) in the yajiiopavlta 
mode, but when he wears only one garment then he should 
wear it round the lower part of the body ( and should not cover 
the upper body with a portion of the garment though it may be 
long enough for that ). Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 prescribes that a 
man must be yajnopavltin at the time of waiting upon teachers, 
elders, guests, at the time of homa, in japa ( murmuring prayer), 
at meals and in taking acamana and at the time of daily vedic 
study. On this Haradatta says ' yajnopavlfca means a particular 
mode of wearing the ( upper ) garment; if one has no upper 
garment, then there is another ( but inferior ) mode stated in 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4. 23 and that at other times it is not necessary 
to have the yajnopavlta \ 

The Gobhila gr. ( I. 2. 1 ) in treating of upanayana 681 says 
1 the student takes as yajnopavlta a cord of threads, a garment

or a rope of kuSa grass \ This indicates that though a cord of 
threads was considered in Gobhila's days as the appropriate 
yajiiopavlta, that was not an invariable rule in his day and that 
a garment could be employed instead. The commentator being 
brought up in the latter day tradition explains by saying that 
if the sutra was lost in a forest then a garment may be worn 
like the sacred thread and if even that was lost a rope of kusa. 
But this appears to be rather far-fetched as an explanation of 
Gobhila's unqualified words. Manu (11.44) says that 'the 
upavlta of a brahmana should be made of cotton , its strands 
should be twined with the right hand moved over them ( or the 
twist of the strands must be upwards ) and it should have three 
threads \ Medhatithi comments on this that ' upavlta ' means a 
particular mode of wearing a garment or a particular position of 
it and therefore here by upavlta is meant that which can be worn 
in that mode. The Sm. 0. quotes a prose passage from Bsyasrhga 
* or one may carry out all the purposes for which yajiiopavlta is 
required by means of a garment and in its absence by a string 
of three threads \ From the above passages, from the fact that 
many of the grhyasutras are entirely silent about the giving or 
wearing of the sacred thread in upanayana and from the fact 
that no mantra 888 is cited from the Vedic Literature for the act 
of giving the yajiiopavlta (which is now the centre of the 
upanayana rites ), while scores of vedic mantras are cited for 
the several component parts of the ceremony of upanayana, it is 
most probable, if not certain, that the sacred thread was not 
invariably used in the older times as in the times of the later 
smrfcis and in modern times, that originally the upper garment 
was used in various positions for certain acts, that it could be 
laid aside altogether in the most ancient times and that the 
cord of threads came to be used first as an option and later 
on exclusively for the upper garment. 

A few rules about yajnopavlta may now be stated here. 888 
The yajnopavlta is to have three threads of nine Btrands well 

682. The mantra l ^^ftq^lcf <T*H &c. is cited only in Baud. gr. ( note 
662 above ) and in Vaik. ( II. 5), has certainly a comparatively modem 
ring about it and is not cited in any well-known ancient work. 

683. Vide *s<^*J*m P- 4 and tf. si. pp. 416-418 as to how the upavlta 
is to bo manufactured and who is to manufacture it, one interesting 
fact being that an upavlta prepared by a maiden was to be preferred to 
one prepared by a widow. *?^T*oT quoted in the aiiqrwCT defines 3j*Â§-

twisted (for each thread). Vide Baud. Dh.S.I. 5.5., Devala quoted 
in the Sm. C. 884 . The nine devatas of the nine tantus ( strands ) 
are given by Devala viz. Orhkara, Agni, Naga, Soma, Pitrs, 
Prajapati,Vayu,Surya, 885 all gods. Medhatithi on Manu 11.44 says 
that in istis, animal sacrifices and soma sacrifices, the yajnopavlta 
was to have only one thread of three tantus, but it was three-fold 
in three classes of ahlna, ekaha, and sattra sacrifices as they 
required three fires and in the seven somasanisthas seven-fold and 
five-fold when viewed with reference to the three savanas and 
two samdhyas. The yajfiopavlta should reach as far as the 
navel, should not reach beyond the navel, nor should it be above 
the chest. 688 Manu II. 44 and Visnu Dh. S. 27. 19 prescribe that 
the yajnopavlta for brahtnana, ksatriya and vaisya should respec- 
tively be of cotton, hemp and sheep wool. Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 5), 
Gobhila gr. (I. %. 1) say that it may be of cotton thread or of kusa 
grass and Devala as quoted in Sm. 0. says that all twice-born 
persons should make their yajnopavlta of cotton, of ksuma, hair 
of cow's tail, hemp, tree bark or kusa according to the availa- 
bility of the material. 687 The remarks of the Samskaramayukha 
after quoting Manu II. 44 are interesting ' we do not know the 
origin of (or authority for) the practice of present-day ksatriyas 
and vaisyas, viz. of wearing cotton yajfiopavlta \ This shows 
that in the 17th century A. D. many ksatriyas and vaisyas put on 
yajnopavlta. 888 Kumarila also says that wearing yajnopavlta 
and studying Vedas is common to all the three varnas. 

The number of yajnopavitas to be worn differed according 
to circumstances. Abrahmacarl was to wear only one yajnopavlta 
and samnyasins, when they kept yajnopavlta at all, also wore

only one. A snataka 689 ( i. e. one who has returned from the 
teacher's house after brahraacarya ) and a house-holder were 
to wear two while one who desired long life may wear 
more than two. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 14 says * snatakas should 
always wear a lower garment and an upper one, two 
yajnopavltas, should have a stick and a pot filled with 
water \ Kasyapa allowed a householder to wear any number 
up to ten. Whether yajnopavita as worn in modern times 
was worn from the most ancient times or not, it is certain 
that long before the Christian era it had come to be so worn 
and it had become an inflexible rule that a brahmana must 
always wear a yajnopavita and have his top-knot (of hair) 
always tied up ; if he did any act without observing this rule, 
it was inefficacious. 690 Vas. 891 and Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 1 ) both 
say that a man must always wear yajiiopavlta. If a brahmana 
took his meals without wearing yajiiopavlta, he had to undergo 
prayascitta viz. to bathe, to mutter prayers and fast; vide 
Laghu-Harlta verse 23 quoted by Apararka pp. 1171, 1173. The 
Mit. on Yaj. III. 292 prescribes prayascitta for answering calls 
of nature without having the yajfiopavlta placed on the right 
ear ( as Yaj. I. 16 prescribes). Manu IV. 6$ forbids the wearing 
of another's yajnopavita along with several other things ( such 
as shoes, ornament, garland and kamandalu ). In Yaj. ( I. 16 and 
133 ) and other smrtis the yajnopavlfca is called brahmasutra. 

An interesting question is whether women ever had upa- 
nayana performed or whether they had to wear the yajnopavita. 
Several smrtis contain instructive dicta on this point. 692 The

HSrlfcadharmasutra as quoted in the Sm. C. and other digests 
says * there are two sorts of women, those that are brahma*- 
vadinls ( i. e. students of sacred lore ) and those that are sadyo- 
vadhils ( i. e. who straightway marry ). Out of these brahma- 
vSdinls have to go through upanayana, keeping fire, vedic study 
and begging in one's house ( i. e. under the parental roof ) \ 
but in the case of sadyovadhus when their marriage is drawing 
near, the mere ceremony of upanayana should somehow be 
performed and then their marriage should be celebrated. ' In 
the Gobhila gr. m II. 1. 19 it is said " leading forward towards 
the sacred fire ( from the house ) the bride who is wrapped in 
a robe and wears the sacred thread (slang from her left 
shoulder, in the yajiiopavlta mode ) he ( the husband ) should 
murmur the verse * Soma gave her to Gandharva * ( Rg. X. 85. 
41 ) ". It is clear that the girl, according to Gobhila, wore the 
yajiiopavlta as a symbol of the rite of upanayana. The com- 
mentator to whom this procedure naturally seemed strange 
explains ' yajnopavltinlm ' as meaning * whose upper garment is 
worn in the fashion of the sacred thread'. In the Samskara- 
tattva of Raghunandana it is stated that Hariiarma held that 
according to Gobhila the bride was to wear a yajfiopavlta, 
though Raghunandana himself does not approve of this expla- 
nation. In the ceremony of Samavartana, As v. gr. III. 8, m 
on the subject of applying ointment says ' after having smeared 
the two hands with ointment a brahraana should salve his 
face first, a ksatriya his two arms, a vaisya his belly, a 
woman her private parts and persons who gain their live- 
lihood by running, their thighs'. It is improper to say, 
as some do, that as to women this is a general rule inter- 
polated in the treatment of samavartana and has nothing to 
do with the latter. We should rather hold that As v. knew 
of women undertaking Vedic study and so prescribed what 
they should do in their samavartana. In the Mahabharata 
( Vanaparva 305. 20 ) m a brahmana is said to have taught to the

mother of the Pandava heroes a number of mantras from the 
Atharvasiras. Harlta* 98 prescribes that in the case of women 
samavartana took place before the appearance of menses. There- 
fore brahmavadinl women had upanayana performed in the 8th 
year from conception, then they studied Vedic lore and finished 
student-hood at the age of puberty. Yama m says * in former 
ages, tying of the girdle of munja ( i. e. upanayana ) was 
desired in the case of maidens, they were taught the vedas and 
made to recite the Savitrl ( the sacred Gayatrl verse ) ; either 
their father, uncle or brother taught them and not a stranger 
and begging was prescribed for a maiden in the house itself and 
she was not to wear deer-skin or bark garment and was not to 
have matted hair \ Manu seems to have been aware of this 
usage as prevalent in ancient times, if not his own. Having 
spoken of the sarhskaras from jatakarma to upanayana, Manu 
winds up ( II. 66 ) * these ceremonies were to be performed in 
their entirety for women also, but without mantras* and adds 
( II. 67 ) ' the ceremony of marriage is the only sarhskara per- 
formed with Vedic mantras in the case of women ; ( in their 
case ) attendance on the husband amounts to serving a guru 
(which a student had to do) and performance of domestic duties 
to worship of fire * (which the student had to perform by offering 
a fuel-stick in the evening every day ). This shows that in the 
day of the Manusmrfci, upanayana for women had gone out of 
practice, though there were faint glimmerings of its perform- 
ance for women in former days. Relying on the words ' in 
former ages ' occurring in the verses of Yama quoted above 
medieval digests like the Sm. 0., the Nirnayasindhu and others 
say that this practice belonged to another yuga. In Bana- 
bhatta's Kadambarl,* 98 Mahasveta (who was practising tapas) is 
described as ' one whose body was rendered pure by ( wearing ) 
a brahmasutra ( i. e. yajnopavlta ) \ The yajiiopavlta came to 
have superhuman virtues attributed to it and so probably even 
women who were practising austerities wore it. The Sam. Pr.

296 History of Dharmasastra [ Cb. VII 

( p. 419 ) quotes a verse saying that the Supreme Being is called 
yajna and yajfiopavlta is so called because it belongs to the 
Supreme Being ( or is used in sacrifices for Him ). m 

Though ksatriyas and vaisyas also were entitled to have 
the upanayana performed, it appears that they often neglected 
it or at least neglected the constant wearing of yajfiopavlta, so 
much so that from comparatively early times the yajfiopavlta 
came to be regarded asthepeculiarindioator of the wearer's being 
of the brahmana caste. For example, Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa 
(XI. 64) ?0 Â° while describing the irate brahmana hero Parasu- 
iama says * wearing the upavlta, which was the heritage that 
came to him from his father, and holding a formidable bow that 
came to him from the side of his mother ( who was a ksatriya 
princess )\ If the upavlta had been as constantly worn by the 
ksatriyas as by brahmanas in Kalidasa's day he would not have 
spoken of it as the peculiar sign of a brahmana. In the drama 
Venlsamhara ( Act III ) when Karna resented the attitude of 
Asvatthaman, who raised his left foot for kicking Karna, and 
said that he could not cut off his leg as by virtue of his caste 
( as brahmana ) he could not be punished in that way, Asvattha- 
man replied by throwing away his sacred thread with the 
words 'here do I give up my caste \ 701 That shows that in the 
days of the Venlsamhara ( not later than about 600 A. D. ) the 
yajfiopavlta had become the peculiar indicator of the caste of 
brahmanas only. 

The Baudhayana-sufcra quoted in the Sarhskara-ratnam&la 
(p. 188) says that yarn spun by a brahmana or his maiden 
daughter is to be brought, then one is to measure first 96 angulas 
of it with the syllable bhuh, then another 96 with bhuvah and a 
third 96 with svah, then the yarn so measured is to be kept on 
a leaf of palasa and is to be sprinkled with water to the 
accompaniment of the three mantras ' apo hi stha ' ( Jig. X. 
9. 1-3 ), with the four verses ' Hiranyavarnah ' ( Tai. S. V. 6. 1 
and Atharva I. 33. 1-4 ) and with the anuvaka beginning with 
* pavamanah suvarjanal ' ( Tai. Br. 1. 4. 8) and with the Gayatrl, 
then the yarn is to be taken in the left hand and there is to 
be a clapping of the two hands thrice, the yarn is to be twisted

' orhkara, Agni (quoted above in note 685) ' have to be invoked on

1 devasya tva â¢ and then it is to be shown to the sun with the 
verse ' ud vayam tamasaspari ' ( Rg. I. 50. 10 ) and then the 
yajiiopavlta is to be put on with the verse 4 yajiiopavltam &c* 
Then there is to be a japa of the gayatri verse and then 
Scaraana. For a brief statement of the mode of putting on 
a fresh sacred thread vide note below. 702 

The BaudhSyana-grhyasesasutra ( II. 8. 1-12 ) gives a 
few insignificant points of difference as to the upanayana of 
ksatriyas, vaisyas, ambastha and kararta ( son of a vaisya 
from a sudra female ). It is not necessary to go into these 
details. 

The next important question is as to whether upanayana was 
performed in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idiotic 
&c. Jaimini has established that those who are devoid of a limb 703 
are not eligible for agnihotra, but this inability arises only 
when the defect is incurable. Similarly the Ap. Dh.S. II. 6. 14. 1, 
Gaut. 28. 41-42, Vas. 17. 52-54, Manu 9. 201, Yaj. II. 140-141, 
Visnu. Db. S. 15. 32 ff. lay down that persons- who are impotent, 
patita> congenitally blind or deaf, cripple and those who suffer 
from incurable diseases are not entitled to share property on a 
partition, but are only entitled to be maintained. But they all 
allow even these to marry. As marriage is not possible for 
dvijatis unless upanayana precedes it, it appears that the cere- 
mony of upanayana was gone through as far as it oould be 
carried out in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb &c. The 
Baud. gr. sesasutra (II. 9 ) prescribes a special procedure for 
the upanayana of the deaf and dumb and idiots. The principal 



702. In modern times whenever a new yajiiopavlta has to be worn 
( because the one worn is lost or cut &c.) the ceremony briefly consists 
fn repeatiDg the three vorses * ffpo hi Â§tb5 ' ( Rg. X. 9. 1-3 ) over water 
with which the yajiiopavlta is to be sprinkled ; then there is the repeti- 
tion of the GSyatrl ten times (each time preceded by the vyabttis, as 
* om bhOr bhuvah svah ' ) and then the yajiiopavlta is to be put on with 
the mantra 'yajiiopavltam parainariV (cited above in note 662 ).

points in which their upanayana differs from that of others are 
that the offering of samidh, treading on a stone, putting on a 
garment, the tying of mekhala, the giving of deer skin and 
staff are done silently, that the boy does not mention his name, 
it is the acarya himself who makes offerings of cooked food or 
of clarified butfcer, all the mantras are muttered softly by the 
acarya himself. The sutra 704 says that according to some the 
same procedure is followed as to other persons who are impotent, 
blind, lunatics, or Buffering from such diseases as epilepsy, 
white leprosy or black leprosy &c. The Nirnayasindhu quotes 
a passage from the Brahmapurana cited in the Prayogaparijafca 
about the upanayana of the impotent, the deaf and others which 
contains rules similar to Baudhay ana's. The Sam. Pr. ( pp. 
399-401 ) and S. R. M. ( pp. 273-274 ) also quote the passage 
and explain it. The purana 705 says that those who cannot 
repeat the Gayatrl ( such as the deaf and dumb ) should be 
brought near the teacher or fire and that the teacher should then 
touch them and then mutter the Gayatrl himself, but that in 
other cases such as lunatics, they should be made to repeat the 
Gayatrl at least if possible and if that too is not possible, then 
on touching them the acarya should repeat it. The same purana 
prescribes that kunda and golaka (the first being the offspring of 
an adulterous intercourse when the husband of the woman is 
living and the second when the husband is dead) should have 
upanayana performed in the same way as for the deaf and 
dumb, if it is known that the adulterer and the woman were 
both of the brahmana caste. There is some difference of opinion 
as to kiitKJla and golaka. Manu ( II. 174) defined them as above. 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 1, Manu ( 10. 5 ) and Yaj. ( I. 90, 92 ) 706 
expressly say that a person born of a brahmana from a brahmana 
woman belongs to the same caste only if he is born in lawful 
wedlock and that even the anuloma sons must be born in 
wedlock. The kunfa and golaka being the offspring of adultery

would not really be brahmanas even though both parents were 
brahmanas. Thus, though these two are not strictly brahmanas, 
upanayana of a secondary kind is allowed to them. Manu 
( III. 156 ) included the Imnda and golaka among brahmanas not 
to be invited at sraddha. Elaborate discussions have been held 
why they were so specially mentioned, when they were not on 
Manu's own dictum brahmanas. Some like the author of the 
Samgraha held that the kunQa and golaka forbidden by Manu in 
sraddha were those born under the ancient practice of niyoga ; 
while others repudiated the idea that those born under the 
practice of niyoga had any taint attaching to them. 707 

It is not necessary to go into the question of the upanayana 
of mixed castes. Manu ( X. 41 ) says that the six anulomas are 
eligible for the rites of dirijas ( and so for upanayana ) and the 
Mifc. 708 on Yaj. I. 92 and 95 says that the anulomas have 
upanayana performed according to the rules of the caste of the 
mother and further mixed castes arising from the six anuloma 
castes in the anuloma order are also eligible for upanayana. 
The Baud. gr. sesasutra II. 8 gives rules for the upanayana cf 
ksatriyas, vaisyas and of mixed castes like rathakar a, ambas^ha 
&c. Gaut. 709 IV. 21 made an exception in the case of the son 
of a brahmana from a sudra woman. AH pratilomas were like 
sudra according to Manu ( IV. 41 ) and the offspring of a 
brahmana from a sudra woman, though anuloma, was like 
pratilomas. A sudra is only ekajati and not dvijati ( Gaut. X. 51 ) 
and for the pratilomas ( as well as for the sudra) there was 
no upanayana. 

Upanayana was so highly thought of that some of the 
ancient texts prescribe a method of upanayana for the Asvattha 
tree. Vide Baud. gr. sesasutra II. 10. In modern times also rarely 
this upanayana is performed. To the west of the Asvattha tree 
homa is performed, the sarhskaras from pumsavana are imitated 
but with the vyahrtis only,, the tree being touched with Itg. III.

8. 11 â¢ vanaspate \ A piece of cloth is held between the tree and 
the performer, then eight auspicious verses are repeated ( manga- 
lastaka), the cloth is removed and then the hymn called Dhruva- 
sukta ( Rg. X. 72. 1-9 ) is repeated. Other mantras ( like Rg. X. 
62-63 ) are also recited. Then a piece of cloth, yajnopavlta, 
girdle, staff and deer-skin are given with appropriate mantras 
and lastly after touching the tree, the Gayatrl is repeated. 
In E. C. vol. III. Malavalli No. 22 there is a reference to the 
upanayana of Asvattha trees performed by one Bachappa 
in 1358 A. D. 

Saviiryupadeia : â It will be seen from the passage of the 
Sat. Br. quoted above (in note 625) that the sacred Gayatrl verse 
was imparted in very ancient times to the student by the 
teacher a year, or six months, 24, 12 or 3 days after upanayana 
and that the Sat. Br. prescribes that in the case of br&hmana 
students this must be done immediately. This ancient rule 
was probably due to the fact that students in those far-off 
times when they came to the teacher at the age of seven or eight 
had hardly any previous instruction and so must have found 
it difficult to pronounce properly and correctly the sacred verse 
immediately on initiation. It is for this reason that so modern 
a work as the S. R. M. ( p. 194 ) says that such mantras 
as * San-no devlrabhisfaye * ( Rg. X. 9. 4 ) which have to be 
repeated by the brahmac&rl in the rites of upanayana should 
be taught to him even before upanayana, just as the wife 
( who being a woman had no upanayana performed ) was taught 
the Vedio mantras accompanying such acts as that of examining 
ajya in sacrifices. 710 The same rule 711 of postponing the instruc- 
tion in Gayatrl is stated in San. gr. II. 5, M&nava gr. I. 22. 15, 
Bhar. gr. 1. 9, Par. gr. II. 3. The general practice however seems 
to have been to impart the Gayatrl that very day. According to 
most of the sutras the teacher sits to the north of the fire facing 
the east and in front of him the student sits facing the west 
and then the student requests the teacher to recite to him the 
verge sacred to Savitr and the teacher imparts to him first one 
pada at a time, then two padas and then the whole. According

to Baud. gr. II, 5. 34-37 the student places on the fire four 
fuel sticks of the pal&&a or other sacrificial tree anointed 
with clarified butter and repeats mantras to Agni, Vayu, 
Aditya and the lord of vrafas with ' svaha * when offering 718 
them. Various intricate modes occur in the sutras and the 
commentaries thereon about how this first instruction in 
Gayatri is to be carried out. The differences are due to 
the place assigned to the vyahrkis 713 ( bhuh, bhuvah, svah ). 
Two illustrations are set out below from Sudarsana 7U on Ap. gr. 
II. 11. The syllable ' om * has been looked upon as very sacred 
from ancient times and is a symbol of the Supreme Being. The 
Tai. Br. II. 11 contains a eulogy of ' omkara 'â¢ and quotes 
Bg. 1. 164. 39 in support ' rco aksare parame &o. ' taking the 
word * aksara * to mean the ' omkara \ The Tai. Up. I. 8. 
says * ( syllable ) om is Brahma ; om is all this ( universe )\ A 
brahmana about to begin the teaching ( of the Veda ) says * om ' 
with the idea that he may reach near brahrrvi. 'Om* is called 
pravava. Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 13. 6 says ' omkara is the door to

heaven ; therefore one who is about to study the Veda, should 
start his study by first repeating omS Manu ( II. 74 ) prescribes 
the repetition of pranava at the beginning and at the end of 
daily Vedio study and further on ( II. 76 ) says that the three 
letters ' a \ ' u \ ' m ' ( in om ) and the three vy ahrtis were distilled 
from the three vedas by Prajapati as the essence. Medhatithi 
on Manu ( II. 74 ) says that ' om must be uttered at the begin- 
ning of the daily Vedio study by the student or by the house- 
holder ( when performing brahmayajiia ), but it is not necessary 
in japa' &o. In the Markandeya-purana chap. 42, Vayu chap. 20 , 
Vrddha-Harlta-smrbi VI. 59-62 and in numerous other places 
there are hyperbolical or esoterio identifications of the three 
letters of om with Visnu, LaksmI and the jlva, with the three 
Vedas, with the three worlds, with three fires &o. In the 
Ka^hopanisad I. 2. 15-17 om is said to be the end of all Vedas, 
the source of the knowledge of brahma and also its symbol. 

The sacred Gayatrl verse is Rg. III. 62. 10 and occurs in 
the other Vedas also. It is addressed to Savitr (the sun) and may 
also be interpreted as a prayer to the Source and Inspirer of 
everything. It literally means ' we contemplate that esteemed 
( longed for) refulgence ( glory ) of the divine Savitr who may 
inspire our intellects (or actions) \ Some grhya sutras prescribe 
the same verse for all students, whether brahmanas, ksatriyas 
or vaisyas. But others say that for brahmana the Savitrl verse 
is the Gayatrl, but for ksatriyas and vaisyas, a savitrl ( verse 
addressed to Savitr ) in the Tristubh ( having 11 syllables in 
each quarter ) or Jagatl ( 12 syllables in each quarter ) should 
be the proper one. Here again there is difference. Acoording 
to the commentators on the Kathaka gr. ( 4i. 20 ), the verse 
' adabdhebhih savita ' ( Kathakam IV. 10 ) and the verse ' Visva 
rupani ' ( Kathakam XVI. 8 ) are cited as the Savitrl for a 
ksatriya and a vaisya respectively ; while the commentator on 
San. gr. (II. 5. 4-6) says that the Tristubh which is to be taught 
as the Savitrl to the ksatriya students is ' a krsnena rajasa * 
Rg. I. 35. 2) and the Jagatl Savitrl for the vaisya is ' Hiranya- 
panih savita ' ( Rg. I. 35. 9 ) or ' hamsah sucisad * ( Rg. IV. 40. 
5 ). According to the Varahagrhya (5) ' devo yati savita ' and 
'yufijate manah ' ( Rg. V. 81. 1 ) are the Tristubh and Jagatl meant 
as Savitrl for the ksatriya and vaisya respectively. According 
to Satatapa quoted in the Madanaparijata ( p. 23 ) the verse ' Deva 
savitah* (Tai. S. I. 7. 7. 1, Kathakam XIII. 14 ) is the savitrl 
for the ksatriya. According to Medhatithi on Manu II. 38 4 a 
krsnena ( Rg. I. 35. 2 ) and ' visva rupani * ( Kathakam XVI. 8 ) 



Ch. VII ] Upanayana and the Gayatri 303 

are the two Savitrls respectively for ksatriya and vateya. That 
all these rules about the Savitrl being in the Gayatri, Tristubh 
and JagatI metres for the three varnas respectively are probably 
vary ancient follows from the text 'gayctrya brahraanamasrajata 
tristubha" rajanyam &c.' (quoted in note 356 above). The Asv. gr., 
Ap. gr,, and some other sutras are entirely silent on the point, 
while Par. gr. IF. 3 allows an option viz. all varnas may learn 
the Gayatri or the Savitrl verses in the Gayatri, Tristubh and 
JagatI respectively. 715 Why the Gayatri verse ( Rg. III. 62. 10 ) 
came to be famous it is difficult to say. Its fame was probably 
due to its grand simplicity and to its adaptability to an idealistic 
conception of the world as emanating from an all-pervading 
Intelligence. The Gopatha Brahmana ( I. 32-33 ) explains the 
Gayatri in various ways. In the Tai. Ar. ( II. 11 ) it is stated 
that the mystic words 'bhuh. bhuvah, svah' are the truth (essence) 
of speech and that Savita in the Gayatri means 'one who en- 
genders glory \ 716 Atharvaveda 19. 71. 1 calls it ' vedamata ' 
and prays that it may confer long life, glory, children, cattle 
&c. on the singer. 717 The Br. Up. V. 14. 1-6 718 contains a sublime 
eulogy of Gayatri which word is there derived from ' gaya ' 
meaning ' prana \ and the root ' trai ' ( to save ) and it is said 
that when the teacher repeats the Gayatri for the benefit of the 
young student he thereby saves the boy's life ( from ignorance 
and the effects of sin ). The Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 mentions a 
brahmana text to the effect that the Savitrl is recited for all the 
Vedas ( i. e. by its recital all Vedas become recited as it is 
their essence ). Manu II. 77 ( = Visnu Dh, S. 55. 14 ) says that 
each pada of the Savitrl was as if extracted from each of the 
three Vedas and that ( II. 81= Visnu Dh. S. 55. 15 ) the Savitrl 
together with om and the three mystic syllables (bhuÂ£. &c.) is the 
mouth of Vedic lore (since Vedic study starts with it, or 'brahma' 
may mean ' the Supreme Being ' ). Manu II. 77-83, Visnu

Brhat-Par&sara chap. V ( where the mystical significance of each 
of the 24 letters of the Gayatrl is explained ) and numerous 719 
other works contain hyperbolical eulogies of Gayatrl. Parasara 
V. 1 calls it 4 Vedamata'. The words * Apo jyotl rasomrbam brahma 
bhur-bhuyah svarom* are said to be the Uras ( head ) of the Gaya- 
trl ( vide Sankhasmrfci XII. 12 ). Manu ( II. 104 ) and others pres- 
cribe that every day a brahmacari ( as well as others) must per- 
form japa of Gayatrl. Baud. Dh. S. II 4. 7-9 prescribes that in 
the evening Sarhdhya adoration one should murmur the Gayatrl 
a thousand times, or a hundred times with pranayama each time 
or ten times with *om* and the seven vyahrtis. 720 Vas. Dh. S. 26. 
15 prescribes that a man desirous of purifying himself from sin 
should repeat the divine Gayatrl 1000 times (daily) as the maxi- 
mum or 100 times (as the middle way) or at least ten times. There 
are mantrasfor invoking the Gayatrl and for taking leave of it. 781 

Brahmacari-dharmah : â Certain rules and observances are 
prescribed for all brahmacarins 788 . They are of two kinds, 
some are prescribed for a very short time and some have to be 
observed for all the years of studenthood. The As v. gr. 1. 22. 17 7?3

the brahmaoarl should not eat ' ksara * and ' lavana ' and should 
sleep on the ground". The same rule is stated by Baud, 
gr. II. 5. 55 ( adding the maintenance of the fire kindled at the 
upanayana for three days), BhSr. gr. 1. 10, Par. gr. II. 5, Khadira 
gr. II. 4. 33 (adding avoidance of milk also for three days). Hir. 
gr. ( I. 8. 2 ) specially prescribes for the first three days the 
avoidance of ksara, of lavana and vegetables, and the duty of 
sleeping on the ground, of not drinking out of an earthen vessel, 
of not giving the remnants of his food to stidras and several 
other observances which he has to continue throughout the 
period of student-hood. These latter are briefly indicated in 
Manu II. 108 and 176 viz. offering samidhs into fire, begging for 
food, not using a cot, working for the teacher, daily bath, 
tarpaya of gods, sages and pitrs &c. 

The observances that last throughout the period of student- 
hood are first seen in the passage of the Sat. Br. (quoted above in 
note 625 ). The same are laid down in Asv. gr. I. 22. 2 ( quoted 
on p. 283 above ), Par. gr. II. 3, ip. Mantrapatba (II. 6. 14), 
K&thaka gr. ( 41. 17 ) and other texts. These are principally 
acamana, guru^usrusa, vaksarhyama ( silence ), samidadhana. 
When the teacher says in the upanayana ' drink water, do work 
&c \ the student is to reply with the word ' yes ' ( 'badham' or 
ora ). But the sutras and smrtis lay down many rules about 
these and other observances ; vide Gaut. II. 10-40, San. gr. II. 6. 8, 
Gobhila gr. III. 1.27, Khadira gr. II. 5. 10-16, Hir. gr.8.1-7, Ap. 
Dh. S. I. 1. 3. 11-L 2. 7. 30, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2, Manu II. 49-249, 
Yaj. 1. 16-32 &c. The rules centre principally round agnipa- 
ricarya ( worshipping- fire ), bhiksa ( begging for food ), 
sarhdhyopasana, study of Veda and its methods and duration, 
avoidance of certain foods and drinks and other matters like

briefly disposed off. 

On the 4th day after upanayana a rite was performed called 
Medhajanana 724 ( generation of intelligence ) by virtue of which

it was supposed that the student's intellect was made capable of 
mastering Vedic lore. Asv. gr. I. 22. 18-1,9 deals with this. The 
teacher makes the student sprinkle water in an unobjectionable 
direction thrice from the left to the right with a pot of water 
round about a palasa tree that has one root, or round a bunch 
of kusa grass if there is no palasa, and makes him repeat 
the mantra 'Oh glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, 
glorious one, are glorious, thus, glorious one, make me full of 
glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for 
the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of 
Veda among men' 725 . The Bhar. gr. ( I. 10 ) also prescribes this 
rite on the fourth day after upanayana and says that a palasa 
tree with one root is to be anointed with ajija and the mantra 
* susravah ' ( the same as in As v. ) is to be muttered. 
Kathaka gr. 41. 18, Manava gr. I. 22. 17 also refer to this. 
The Sam. Pr. ( pp. 444-446 ) gives a more elaborate des- 
cription. In addition to what is stated in Asv. gr. it quotes 
from Saunaka and adds a few more details, viz. the student 
deposits at the root of the palasa his garments already worn, 
the staff and (he girdle and then wears new ones and then 
when the boy returns to the house, a stream of water 
is poured before him. The teacher takes the garments &c. left 
by the boy. The Ap. gr. 11. 24 says that on the fouith day the 
teacher takes the garments worn on the day of upanayana 
by the student and the boy wears new ones. Sndarsana 
on Ap. 11. 24 speaks of palasa-karma on the fourth day. The 
boy goes out with his acarya to the east or north and three 
sthandilas are prepared to the north or east of a palasa tree and 
on these three pranava ( om ), sraddha and medha are invoked, 
are worshipped with unguents, flowers, lamp &c. ( as in the 
regular worship of an image ), then the pranava is worshipped 
with the formula * yas-chandasam ' to 'srutam me gopaya' ( Tai. 
Up. L 4.1 ), sraddha with the hymn * sraddhayagnih â¢ Rg. X. 151 
and Medha with the anuvaka ' Medha devl * ( Tai. Ar. X. 39 ). 
Then the staff is deposited at the foot of the palasa, another staff 
is taken and the student returns to the house with the acarya. 
In modern times in the Decoan a similar ceremony is gone 
through under the ( Marathi ) name * Palasula \

Ch. VII ] Upanayana and brahmacaridharma 307 

We have seen above that the student; has to offer samidh 
( fuel stick ) into fche fire on the day of upanayana. The fire 
kindled at the time of upanayana was to be kept up for three days 
and fche fuel-sticks were offered in that fire during those days. 
Afterwards samidh was to be offered in the ordinary fire ( vide 
Baud. gr. II. 5. 55-57, Ap. gr. 11. 22 ). The student is required 
to offer every day after upanayana a samidh into fire in the 
evening and in the morning. Asv. gr. I. 22. 6 prescribes this 
and the commentator Narayana adds that in so doing he has to 
observe the procedure prescribed in Asv. gr. I. 20. 10-1. 21. 4 for 
the putting on of samidh Â§n the first day. San. gr. II. 10, Maim 
II. 186, Yaj. I. 25 and almost all others prescribe the offering of 
samidh into fire in the evening as well as in the morning ; but 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 17 notes that according to some * agnipiija ' 
was to be performed in the evening only. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1. 4. 
14-20) lays down the following rules : *the student 786 should 
always bring fuel from the forest and heap it on a low place 
(otherwise if placed high it may fall on anybody's head), one 
should not go out after sunset for bringing fuel-sticks. Hav- 
ing kindled fire, having swept round it he should offer fuel-sticks 
in the evening and the morning as already directed ( in the 
grhyasutra \ One should sweep round the fire that is burning 
red-hot with the hand and not with a broom ( of kusa grass ).' 
The Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 12 further prescribes that no fuel is to 
be placed on fire ( in srauta and smarta rifces ) unless water has 
been sprinkled over it. The student had not only to offer 
samidhs on his own account into the fire, bu<; he had to help his 
acarya in the latter's worship of fire by bringing fuel and by 
offering oblations for his acarya when the latter wa3 away on 
a journey or was ill. The Asv. gr. I. 9. 1 says 787 'beginning from 
marriage a householder should worship grhya fire himself or 
his wife or son or maiden daughter or pupil may do so.' The 
Chandogya Up. IV. 10 contains the story of Upakosala Kama- 
layana who was a student of SatyakSma JabSla and looked after 
his teacher's fires for twelve years and whom Satyakama did not 
teach anything, though the wife of Satyakama interceded on 
behalf of the dejected pupil.

A few words about samidhs may be said here. The 
samidh 7M must be of palasa or some other yajriiya tree ( used 
in sacrifices). Such trees are pala&a, a&vattha, nyagrodha, 
plaksa, vaikankata, udurabara, bilva, candana, sarala, 6ala, 
devadaru and khadira. The Vayupurana quoted by Apar&rka 
( p. 51 ) says that palasa samidhs should be preferred, in their 
absence samidhs of khadira, in the absence of the first two, of 
daml, rohitaka and asvattha and in the absence of all these of 
arka and vetasa. The Trikanda-mandana ( II. 82-34 ) has 
several rules on this point. The principal trees for fuelsticks 
( samidh ) are palasa and khadira, but samidhs of kovidSra, 
bibhltaka, kapittha, karabha, rajavrksa, ^akadruma, nlpa, 
nimba, karanja, tilaka, slesmataka or salmali are not to be 
employed. The samidh was not to be thicker than the thumb, 
was to have its bark on it, was not to be worm-eaten nor 
divided, nor longer nor shorter than the span ( pradesa ) nor 
having two branches, it was to be without leaves and was to be 
strong. 729 According to Harlta ' when death wanted to seize 
the brahmacarl formerly, Agni saved him from death and so a 
brahmacarl should serve fire \ 7S0 

The number of samidhs varied as shown above and not 
only in the worship of Agni by the brahmacarl, but also else- 
where. 

Bhiksa : â The Asv. gr. after prescribing begging for food 
states ( I. 22. 7-8 ) that the student should first beg of a man 
who would not refuse or of a woman who would not refuse and 
that in begging he should say ' sir, give food \ More detailed 
rules are laid down by others. 

The Hir. gr. ( S. B. E, vol. 30 p. 157 ) says " after giving 
the student the staff the teacher gives him a bowl ( for collecting

alms ) and says to him * go out for alms \ Let him beg of his 
mother first, then in other families which are generously 
disposed ; he brings the f eod to his guru and announces it to 
him with the words ' ( these are ) the alms ' and then the teacher 
accepts with the words * these are good alms \" The Baud, gr. 
II. 5. 47-53 gives the same rules and adds 731 that a brahraana 
student should bog with the words ' bhavati bhiksam dehi ' (lady, 
give me food ), a ksatriya with the words ' bhiksam bhavati 
dehi * and a vaisya with the words ' dehi bhiksam bhavati/ 
Par. gr. II. 5, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 3. 28-30, Band. Dh. S. L 2. 17, 
Manu II. 49, Yaj. I. 30 and others contain the same rules about 
addressing the ladies for alms. 738 Par. gr. II. 5 says that the 
student should first beg of three women who would not refuse 
or of six, of twelve or of an unlimited number and that 
according to some he should first beg of his mother. Manu 
II. 50 says that he should first beg of his mother, sister 
or mother's sister. Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 3. 26 says that if 
women refuse to give alms to a devout brahmacarl he 
snatches away or destroys their merit arising from sacrifices, 
gifts and burnt offerings, progeny, cattle, spiritual glory 
( of their families ) and food and quotes a Brahmana 
passage * therefore indeed one should not refuse to give food 
to a crowd of students moving about ( for alms ) for fear that 
among them there may be some one who is like this ( a devout 
student ), and who has carried out all the observances for 
students.' If a brahmacarl cannot get food elsewhere he may 
beg from his own family, from his elders (like maternal uncles), 
his relatives and lastly from his acarya himself. As to the 
persons 732 from whom to beg for food, one sees how the growing 
strictness of caste rules about food during the lapse of centuries 
affected the brahmacarl. Ap. Dh. S. m I. 1. 3. 25 prescribes that

he could beg food from anybody except apapatras ( persons like 
candalas ) and abhisastas ( i. e. those who are guilty of or 
suspected of grave sins ). Gaut. II. 41 expressly says that a 
brahmacan may beg food from all the varnas except from those 
who are abhisasta and patita. Manu ( II. 183 and 185 ) says a 
brahmacarl should beg for food at the houses of those who study 
the Veda and perforin sacrifices, who are devoted to their duties 
and are virtuous in their conduct ; if from such persons 
food cannot be had he may go about the whole village, but 
should avoid those who are abhisasta. Yaj. I. 29 says ' for his 
own maintenance a brahmacarl should beg food from brahma- 
nas who are blameless ' and the ancient commentator Visvarupa 
says that the best way is to beg at brahmana houses, the next 
best is to beg of ksatriya and vaisya houses and to beg of siidras 
is allowed only in apad (time of distress or difficulty ). Ausa- 
nasa ( Jiv. ed I. p. 505 ) says that a brahmacarl should beg only 
from houses of bis own caste ( as the best way probably ) or he 
may beg at the houses of all varnas, while Angiras quoted in 
the Par. M. ( I. 2, p. 41 ) says that even in a season of distress a 
brahmacarl should not beg for cooked food from siidras. The 
Madanaparijata p. 33 quotes a passage from the Bhavisyapurana 
to the effect that a brahmacarl may beg food from anybody 
except a sudra. 

Food obtained by begging was supposed to be pure as said 
by Manu II. 189, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 56 and Yaj. I. 187. It was 
further said that a brahmacarl who subsists on food obtained 
by begging is like one observing a fast ( Manu II. 183 and 
Brhat-Parasara p. 130 ). The brahmacarl was to eat food 
collected from several houses and was not to take food at a 
single person's house, except that when he was requested to 
dinner in honour of gods or the Manes he might do so by partak- 



( Co?Uinued from last page) 
course was possible), while od sm. \j. % I. 1. 3. 25 he explains wtrrw as

allowed to use the vessels out of which members of other castes are to

thrown away), zmvfc p. 720 explains 3*Â«T<rr5r as q;r>crerffi[ ^firnrfff*^: 
(i. e. one who has lost caste through the commission of some mortal sin). 
According to Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 7-9 an abhisasta is one that kills any 
brtthmana or kills a brahmana woman who is Atreyl. According to Ap. Dh. 
S.I. 7. 21. 8 * BbhUastya ' is one of the grave ^sins L and is explained by

Ch. VII ] Upanayana and bhiksa 311 

ing of such food at such dinners as would not violate his vows. 
Vide Manu II. 188-189 and Yaj. I. 32. 

Corresponding to the duty of the student to beg was the 
obligation cast on householders to serve food according to 
their ability to brahmacarina and yatls ( ascetics ). Gautama 
V. 16 prescribes that after performing the daily yajfias to gods 
( vaisvadeva ) and offering ball to bhutas, the householder 
should offer alms ( of food ) preceded by the word * svasti ' and 
by water. Manu III. 94, Yaj. I. 108 and others say that alms 
should be given to ascetics and brahraacarins with honour and 
welcome. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 108 says that alms should be 
ordinarily one morsel of food as large as the egg of a pea-hen 
and quotes a verse of Satafcapa 725 saying that * bhiksa is as much 
as one morsel, that puskala is equal to four morsels, hanta is 
equal to four puskalas and agra is equal to three hantas' 

The idea that a brahmaoarl must beg for his food and offer 
fuel-sticks every day was so ingrained in ancient times that 
the Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 54 and Manu II. 187 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 
28. 52 ) prescribe that if for seven days continuously a brahma- 
carl who was not ill failed to offer fuel-sticks and to beg for 
food he violated his vow and had to undergo the same penanco 
as was prescribed for a brahmacarl having sexual intercourse. 726 
Even in modern times many brahmana students ( not only 
those who study the Veda from orthodox teachers but even 
those learning English) begged for their daily food and by 
dint of hard discipline, patient industry and integrity rose to 
high positions in public life. However the practice of poor 
begging students attending English schools in this way is 
dying out, since English education does not now ensure for the 
poor brahmana students even a bare maintenance. 

Other important rules about the begging of food are that 
the student should not beg for his sake alone, should announce

to the teacher all that he has brought and eat only that which 
the teacher directs him to take ; if the teacher is gone on a journey 
then he should announce it; to the teacher's family ( wife, son ); 
if even these are absent, then to other learned brShmanas and 
eat with their permission. Vide Ap. Db. S. 1. 1. 3. 31-35, Manu 
II. 51. He should leave no residue in his dish and wash it 
after taking his meal therein. If he is not able to eat the 
whole that he has brought he should bury it underground or 
consign it to water or place that which is more than he can eat 
near an arya or give it to a sudra who works for his teacher 
( Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 3. 37-41 ). Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1. 3. 43-44) says that 
alms are held to be equal to sacrificial food, the teacher holds 
the place of the deity and of the ahavanlya fire. 737 

Other miscellaneous acts that the students had to do were 
bringing 728 water for the acarya in pots, collecting flowers, 
cowdung, earth, kusa^rass &c. ( vide Manu II. 182 ). 

Samdhya : â On the day of upanayana there is no morning 
samdhya, Jaimini m says 'as long as there is no imparting of the 
Gayatrl there is no samdhya/ So the student begins his samdhya 
in the noon of the day of upanayana. As however on that day 
he knows no Vedic text except the Gayatrl, his whole samdhya 
worship consists of the Gayatrl. 

The word * samdhya ' literally means ' twilight \ but also 
indicates the action of prayer performed in the morning and 
evening twilight. This act is generally styled 'samdhyopasana' 
or * samdhya vandana ' or simply 'samdhya/ 740 This act of 
adoration is sometimes prescribed as necessary thrice a day viz. 
at day-break, in the noon and at sun-set e.g. Atri 741 says 'a twice- 
born person possessed of the knowledge of the Self should 
perform three samdhyS adorations.' These are respectively 
named Gayatrl ( morning one ), Savitrl ( noon ) and SarasvatI

( evening one ) by Yoga-yajnavalkya. Generally however th* 
samdhyS prayer is prescribed twice ( Ssv. gr. III. 7, Ap. Dh. S. 
1. 11. 30. 8, Gaut. II. 17, Manu II. 101, Yaj. I. 24-25 &c). 

All prescribe that the morning 748 prayer is to be begun 
before sunrise and should be carried on till the disc of the sun 
is seen on the horizon and the evening prayer begins when the 
disc of the sun is about to set and goes on up to the appearance 
of stars. This is the most proper time ; but a secondary time 
was allowed up to three ghatikas after sunrise and sun-set. 
The duration of the prayer each time was to be one 
muhurta ( i. e. two ghatikas, according to Yoga-yajnavalkya ) 
whatever the length of the day may be. 748 Manu ( IV. 93-94 ) 
however recommends the prayer to extend as long as one could 
afford, since the ancient sages secured long life, intelligence, 
glory, fame and spiritual eminence by long samdhya prayers. 74 * 

According to most writers japa of GSyatrl and other sacred 
mantras is the principal thing in samdhya and other things 
such as marjana are merely subsidiary, but Medhatithi on 
Manu II. 101 (where the words are 'japanstisthet' and not 
' tisthan japet ') says that japa is subsidiary or secondary and 
the place of the prayer and the posture of the praying person are 
the principal items. When it is said ' one should perform the 
samdhyft* what is meant is that one should contemplate the deity 
called Aditya represented by the orb of the sun and should also 
contemplate on the fact that the same Intelligence dwells in his 
heart. The proper place for samdhya prayer is outside the 
village ( Ap. Dh. S. 1. 11. 30. 8, Gaut. II. 16, Manava gr. I. 2. 2), 
in a lonely place ( San. gr. II 9. 1 * aranye ' ) or on a river or 
other sacred spot (Baud. gr. II. 4. 1). But this does not apply to the 
agnihotrin, 745 who has to perform vedfc rites and repeat homa

mantras at sun-rise and who therefore may perform samdhya 
adoration in his house. Vasistfia quoted by Aparftrka says that 
samdhya performed in a oowpen or on a river or near the shrine 
of Visnu ( or other deity ) respectively is ten times, 100000 of 
times or numberless times better than samdhyavandana in the 
house. 746 All prescribe that the morning samdhya is to be 
performed standing and the evening one in a sitting posture 
( Aiv. gr, III. 7. 6, San. gr. II. 9. 1 and 3, Manu II. 102 ) and 
the morning samdhya is to be performed facing the east and the 
evening one facing the northwest ( A&v. gr. III. 7. 4, San. gy. 
II. 9. 1 ). He is to bathe, to sit in a pure spot on a seat of kusa 
grass, should have the sacred cord in the usual position and 
restrain his speech ( i. e. should be silent and not talk in the 
midst of samdhya ). 

The principal constituents of samdhyopasana are these : 
acamanas (sipping of water), pranayama, marjana thrice 
( sprinkling himself with water to the accompaniment of 
several mantras ), aghamarsana, offering of water to the sun 
( arghya ), japa of Gayatrl, and upasfchana ( reciting mantras by 
way of worship of the sun in the morning and generally of 
Varuna in the evening). Among the earliest references to 
Samdhyopasana is the one in the Tai. Ar. II. 2 t m where it is said 
that when brahmavadins facing the east throw up water 
consecrated by the Gayatrl, the evil spirits that fight with the 
sun are sent tumbling into the country (called) Mandeha Aruna 
( of the evil spirits ). This shows that in ancient times samdhya 
consisted principally of offering water ( arghya ) to the sun in 
worship and japa of Gayatrl. Asv. gr. III. 7. 3-6, San. gr. II. 9. 1-3 
and others refer only to the japa of the Gayatrl mantra in

Samdhyop&sana. Mftnava gr. (L 2. 1-5) refers only to the arghya 
offering to the sun and japa of Gayatrl. It is in the Baud. Dh. 
S. II. 4 that we find an elaboration of samdhyopftsana into 
various components such as acamana, niarjana, japa of G&yatrl 
and upasthana ( worship ) of Mitra and Varuna ( respectively in 
the morning and evening with only two verses in each case ). u * 
Modern writers went on adding details e. g. it is now the 
practice in the Deccan to repeat the 24 names of Visnu at the 
very beginning of the samdhyop&sana, but this is hardly any- 
where prescribed by any smrti or early commentator. Similarly 
elaborate rules are laid down about mystic nyasas with the 
sixteen verses of the PurusasSkta ( vide AparSrka p. 140 ), of 
the nyasa of the NSrayanamantra of 25 letters on 25 parts of the 
body ( Vrddha-Harlta VI. 16-19 ) and of the letters of the Gayatrl 
Brhatpar&dara chap. V. p. 83 ). In modern times acamana is 
performed with the three names of Visnu, viz. Ke6ava, 
NftrSyana and Madhava in the form ' om Ke&avaya namah/ 
The 24 names are given below. 748 * 

A few words on each of the principal components of 
samdhya may be said here. Elaborate rules about acamana are 
laid down in several smrtis ; vide Gaut. I. 35-40, A p. Dh. S. I. 
5. 15. 2-11 and 16. l-16,Manu II. 58-62, Yaj. I. 18-21. Such 
rules must have been elaborated from very ancient times. The 
Tai. Br. ( I. 5. 10 ) prescribes that one should not perform 
acamana with water that is in a cleft of the earth. Ap. Dh. S. 
( 1. 5. 15. 5 ) says the same thing. 749 One should perform

whole of Rg. III. 59 in the morning adoration and Rg. I. 25. 1-10 
( addressed to Varuna ) in the evening. The Sm. C. ( I. p. 139 ) says

acamana in a sitting posture ( and not standing nor bent ) in a 
pure spot, facing the north or east, one should sip water thrice 
with water that is not hot and that is free from foam or 
bubbles, one should after sipping water wipe the lips twice 
(thrice according to Ap.)and should touch with the wet right hand 
one's eyes, ears, nose, heart and head. The water for acamana 
should be as much as would penetrate ( or reach ) to the heart in 
the case of brahmanas, to the throat in the case of ksatriyas, to 
the palate in the case of vaisyas ; women and sudras should sip 
on occasions of acamana only once as muoh water as would reaoh 
the palate. Manu (II. 18) and Yaj. (L 18) say that water should be 
sipped by the brahmatlrtha (i. e. from the root of the thumb). 750 The 
further elaborate rules laid down in such smrfcis as Gobhila gr. 
( L 2. 5-6 ), Sankhasmrti 10 are not set out here. The occasions 
for acamana are many. According to Gobhila 751 gr. 1. 1. % one 
must do every grhya rite with yajnopavlta worn in the usual 
way and after acamana. Haradatfca on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 
says that acamana is a subsidiary matter in all religious acts. 
There are several occasions when the sipping of water twice is 
necessary, the principal being before and after bhojana ( meals ) ; 
vide Gautama I. 40, Vas. 3. 38, Yaj. I. 196, Sm. 0. 1, p. 100, 
Madanaparijata p. 57, Par. M. I. part 1. pp. 241-243. Both the 
Br. Up. ( VI. 1. 14 ) and Chan. Up. V. 2. 2 refer to the practice of 
sipping water before and after bhojana and the Vedantasutra 
III. 3. 18 is based on these upanisad passages and says that 
water is looked upon as the garment of prana. 75B Numerous 
occasions when acamana is necessary are stated in Ap. Dh. S. 
I. 5. 16. 15-16, Manu V. 138 and 145, Yaj. 1. 196, Kurmapurana 
I. 2. 13. 1-8 &c.

thumb and the tips of the fingers of the hand are respectively called the 
M M HK* ( or gyre ), fte^T, wigr and tfc ffpSa. Vide Yaj. 1. 19. Visnu Dh. 
S. 62. 1-4, Vas. Dh. S. III. 64-68, Baud. Dh. I. 5. 14-18. As everywhere, 
there are differences here also. Vus. holds that pitrya is between the 
forefinger and the thumb, and that mSnufa tirtha is at the tips of the 
lingers. Others say that the roots of the four fingers constitute Srsa tirtha 
(Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 18 ).â- Vaik I. 5. and Pa"r. gr. paridisjja mention five 
tirthas (the 5th being in the palm is called Sgneya). Agneya is also 
styled Saumya by others.

Oh. VII ] Samdhya and prayayama 317 

Pranayama ( restraint of breath ) is defined by the Yoga- 
sutra m (II. 49 ) as the regulation of inhalation and exhalation 
of air. Gaut. I. 50 prescribes three pranSyamas, each of which 
lasts for 15 matras ( moras ). Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 30 ( = Vas. 
Dh. S. 25. 13=Sahkhasmrbi VII. 14 ) and Yaj. I. 23 say that the 
iiras of Gayatrl, the three vyahrtis each preceded by * om * and 
the Gayatrl verse are to be rehearsed mentally during the time 
of pranayama. According to Yoga-yajnavalkya, one should first 
revolve in the mind the seven vyahrfcis, each preceded by ' om,' 
then the Gayatrl and then the siras of Gayatrl. 754 Pranayama 
has three components, puraka ( inhaling the outside air ), 
kumbhaka ( keeping in the inhaled air i. e. neither taking in 
air nor giving it out) and recaka ( exhaling air from the lungs ). 
Manu VI. 70-71 highly praises the utility of pranayama in 
purifying the mind of sin. 

Marjana is performed by means of kuÂ£a grass dipped in 
water kept in a vessel of copper or udumbara wood or earthen- 
ware and while doing so one is to repeat ' om/ the vyahrtis, 
Gayatrl and the three verses 4 apo hi stha ' ( Rg. X, 9. 1-3 ). 
Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 2 adds more Vedic mantras for marjana. 75S 
Manava gr. 1. 1. 24, Yaj. I. 22 and others prescribe marjana only 
with the three verses ' apo hi stha ' ( Rg. X. 9. 1-3 ). 

AgJiamarsana ( driving out sin ) consists in taking water 
in the right hand formed in the shape of a cow's ear, holding 
it near one's nose, breathing out from the nose on the water 
( with the idea of driving away sin from oneself ) to the accom- 
paniment of the three verses ' rfcam ca ' ( Rg. X. 190. 1-3 ) and 
then casting the water away to one's left on the ground.

Argkya 7se ( offering water out of respect to the sun ) 
consists in taking water in one's joined hands, repeating the 
Gayatri verse over it and standing facing the sun and casting 
it up thrice. If a man cannot have water ( being at the time of 
Sarhdhyft on a road or in jail &o. ) he could use dust for water. 
The Tai. Ar. II. 2 says that a brahmana contemplating the 
rising and setting sun and doing obeisance to it by going from 
left to right attains all bliss, since this Aditya is Brahma, 

As to japa of Gayatri, vide above under Savitryupadefca 
(p. 304). There is an extensive literature about the greatness of the 
japa of Gayatri and of other holy vedic mantras which are passed 
over here and for which reference may be made to AparSrka pp. 
46-48, Sm. C. I. pp. 143-152, Gr. R. pp. 241-250, Ahnikaprakasa 
pp. 311-316. A few details will be given under ahnika. 

As to upasthana vide above (p. 315, note 748). According to Baud, 
the worship 757 of the sun is done with the verses 'udvayam'(Rg. I. 
50. 10), 'Udu tyam* ($g. 1. 50. 1), i citram , (Bg. L 115. 1), Woakgur' 
(ftg. VII. 66. 16), *ya udagaf (Tai. Ar. IV. 42. 5). Manu IL 103 
prescribes that he who does not perform the Samdhyopasana in 
the morning and evening should be excluded from all aotions 
meant for the benefit or honour of dvijas. Gobhila m smrti II. 
1 says the same and adds that brahmariya resides in the three 
samdhySs and that he who has no concern for samdhyopasana 
is not a brahmana. Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 20 calls upon the religious 
king to make brahmanas, who do not engage in samdhyopasana 
thrice a day, perform the work peculiar to sfldras. The 
Kurma-purana 759 goes so far as to say that even if a person 
engages in other actions which are religious but gives up the 
performance of samdhyopasana, in so doing he falls into numerous 
hells. Manu declares (II. 102) that sins committed at night through 
ignorance ( or oversight ) are removed by the performance of

morning samdhya and the sins committed in the day are 
removed by the evening samdhya. Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 25-28, 
Yaj. III. 307 are to the same effect. When a person is impure 
owing to mourning or birth in the family, he is to perform 
samdhya only up to arghya to the sun but not japa nor 
upasthana. 

In modern times the samdhyopasana has become a lengthy 
business by the addition of materials from puranas and the 
tantras. But as observed by the Samskararatnamala rituals like 
nyasa are non-Vedic 7e0 and many do not perform them. For 
various nyasas and mudras ( postures of the fingers, hands etc ) 
one may consult the Smrti-muktaphala ( ahnika pp. 328-333 ), 
8m. C. I. pp. 146-148.â¢ 

Nyasa means ' mentally invoking god and holy texts to 
come to occupy certain parts of the body to render it a pure and 
fit receptacle for worship and contemplation.' The sixteen verses 
of the Purusasukta (Rg. X. 90) are respectively invoked to reside 
in the left and right hands, the left foot, the right foot, the left 
and right knees, the left and right sides, the navel, the heart, 
the throat, the left and right arms, the mouth, the eyes and the 
head ( vide Apararka p. 140 ). The BhSgavata ( VI. 8. 4-5 ) 
recommends that one should perform nyasa on the hands and 
limbs of one's own body with the two mantras of Narayana 
and thus make Narayana one's armour when some danger 
arises and that one should perform nyasa with * om ' and 
other syllables on one's feet, knees, thighs, belly, heart, 
chest, mouth and head. 768 The Sm. C. I. p. 144 quotes verses 
from Vyasa and Brahma as to the nyasa of the letters of 
the Gayatrl with ' om * and ' namah * on the several parts of the 



p 229.

practice, the following may be consulted : The Introduction to Sadhana- 
mala", vol. 2 ( Gaikwad's Oriental Series ), Indian Historical Quarterly

body. Vrddha-Harlta VJ. 16-19 speaks of the nyasa of the 
twenty-five letters of the mantra about Narftyana on the 
twenty-five parts of the body. The Nityacarapaddhati 
( pp. 578-579 ) describes the nyasa of the letters of the alphabet 
( 51 in all ) from ' Om Kesavfiya namah ' to ' ksam Nrsirhhaya 
namah.' One well-known mode is to assign Govinda, Mahldhara, 
Hrslkesa, Trivikrama, Visrm, Madhava respectively on the 
tips of the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring- 
finger, the small finger and the middle of the palm. Manu II. 60 
enjoining the touching of the limbs and head with water appears 
to contain the germ of this practice of nyasa. 

The Sm. C. I. ( pp. 146-148 ) quotes long passages about the 
mudras ( hand poses ) to be made in the samdhya adoration. The 
Sarhgraha 762 quoted in the Piijaprakasa ( p. 123 ) states that the 
mudras are to be made in worship, at the time of japa, dhyana 
(contemplation ) and when starting on kamya rites ( performed 
for securing some desired object ) and that they tend to bring 
the deity worshipped near to the worshipper. The names and 
number of mudras differ considerably. For example, the Sm. C. 
and Smr. Mu. (ahnika pp. 331-332) quote passages defining 
the following mudras viz. sammukha, sarhputa, vitata, vistlrna, 
dvimukha, trimukha, adhomukha, vyapakanjalika, yamapasa, 
grathita, sammukhonmukha, vilamba, mustika, mlna, kurma, 
varaha, sirhhakranta, mahakranta, mudgara and pallava. 
The Nityacarapaddhati p. 533 derives the word mudra from 
1 mud '( joy ) and the root 'ra' (to give) or 'dravay' (causal 
of dru, to put to flight ) and says that " mudra " is so 
called because it gives delight to the gods and also puts to 
flight asuras ( evil beings ). That work and the Puja-prakasa 
(pp. 123-126) give the names of mudras. They are avahanl, 
stbapinl, sarhnidhapanl, samrodhinl, prasadamudra, avagun- 
thana-mudTa, sammukha, prarthana, sankha, cakra, gada, abja, 
(orpadma), musala, khadga, dhanus, bana, naraca, kumbha, 
vighna ( for Vighnesvara ), saura, pustaka, laksml, saptajihva 
( for Agni Vaisvanara ), durga, namaskara ( bringing together 
both hands from the wrist to the tips of the fingers ), afijali, 
sarhhara (in all 32). The Nityacarapaddhati (p. 536) says 
that sankha, cakra, gada, padma, musala, khadga, srlvatsa and 
kaustubha are the eight mudras of Visnu. The Sm. C. quotes a 



%^rmf^nq^nj n s*rtsraRT5T p. 123. 



Oh. VII ] Saihdhya and mudras 321 

work called 76 * Mahasarhhita that the mudras are not to be 
performed in the presence of a crowd and if so performed the 
deities become angry and the mudras become fruitless. The 
Saradatilaka ( 23. 106 ) states that all deities are gladdened 
by the mudras and in verses 107-114 describes the following 
mudras, viz. avahanl, sthapanl, sarhnidh&panl, samrodhinl, 
sammukha, sakala, avagun^hana, dhenu, mah&mudra. The 
AoSra-dinakara of Vardhamana-suri composed in samvat 1468 
( 1411-12 A. D. ) for Jainas enumerates 42 mudras and defines 
them ( 1923, part II. pp. 385-386 ). 

The influence of these mudras spread outside India and 
they are still practised in the island of Bali. Miss Tyra de 
Kleen has brought out a very interesting book on the ' mudras 
( the hand poses ) practised by Buddhist and Saiva priests ' 
( called pedandas) in Bali, with 60 full page drawings (1924, 
New York ). 

Study a f the Veda : â A detailed examination of the educa- 
tional system from ancient times onwards, together with its 
methods, courses of study and kindred topics will require a 
volume by itself. The works 765 mentioned in the note below 
may be read for that purpose. Here a few salient features alone 
can be set out. 

The pivot of the whole educational system of ancient India 
was the teacher (variously called acarya, guru, upadhyaya). The 
instruction was oral. Rg. VII. 103. 5 ( speaking of frogs ) says 
1 when one of these frogs follows another in making noise just 
as a learner repeats the words of the teacher \ Vide the 
quotations from the Atharvaveda and the Sat. Br. cited above 
(/. n. 622 and 625 ). In the beginning the father alone may have 
taught his son. The story narrated in the Br. Up. V. 2. 1 and 
the story of Svetaketu Aruneya who was taught by his father 
everything he knew ( Br. Up. VI. 2. 1 and 4 ) illustrate this 
( vide/, n. 633 ). But even from very ancient times the practice

of sending 76<5 boys to learn from an acarya had beoome 
usual. The Chan. Up. itself says in one passage ( VI. 1 ) that 
Svetaketus Aruneya was placed by his father for twelve years as 
a student with a teacher. The same upanisad ( III. 11. 5 ) says 
that the father should impart the ' madhuvidyS ' to his eldest 
son or to a worthy pupil only. As the boy Btayed with the 
teacher in the latter's house and all instruction was oral, the 
teacher's position assumed the greatest importance. Satyakama 
Jabala 767 says to his teacher ( in Chan. IV. 9. 3 ) ' I have heard 
from persons like your revered self that knowledge when learnt 
from an acarya reaches the highest excellence \ The Sveta^va- 
taropanisad 788 ( VI. 23 ) places the guru almost on a levei with 
God and inculcates the highest devotion to him. The Ap. Dh. 
S. I. 2. 6. 13 says ' the pupil should wait upon the acarya as if 
he were 789 God. f The story of Ekalavya, whom Drona refused 
to take as a pupil because he was a nisada and who by 
worshipping the image of Drona is alleged to have become 
an adept in archery, illustrates two points viz. the prevailing 
notion of the greatness of a guru and the necessity of single- 
minded devotion to him for attaining proficiency ( vide 
Adiparva 132 for the story and also Dronaparva 181. 17 ). 
The Mahabharata condemns him who learns the Vedas at home 
and says that Raibhya became superior to Yavakrita 770 because 
the former learnt from a guru, while the other did not do so. 
In Manu and other smrtis there is some divergence about the

greatness of the acarya. Manu II. 146 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 30. 44 ) 
says thai; both the father ( janaka ) and the teacher are called 
father (pita ) but the father (i. e. acarya) who imparts the sacred 
Veda is superior to the father that gives ( physical ) birth, since 
the birth in spiritual learning is for a brahmana of eternal 
benefit here and hereafter. But in II. 145 Manu 771 says that 
an acarya is ten times superior to an upadhyaya, the father is 
superior to a hundred acSryas, while the mother is thousand-fold s 
superior to the father. Gaut. II. 56 declares that the acarya is 
the highest among all gurus while according to some the mother 
is the highest. Yaj. I. 35 also places the mother higher than 
the acarya. Gaut. 1. 10-11, Vas. Dh. S. III. 21, Manu II. 140, 
Yaj. I. 34 define 778 the acarya as one who performs the upana- 
yana of the student and imparts the whole Veda to him. The 
Nirukta 773 ( I. 4 ) derives acarya as follows: 'he makes the 
student understand the proper course of conduct, or he collects 
wealth ( i. e. fee ) from the student ( or gathers together the 
meanings of words ), or he increases the intelligence ( of the 
student)'. Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 1. 14 says The acarya is so called since 
the student gathers his duties from him.* Manu II. 69 gays that the 
teacher, after performing upanayana, teaches his pupil the rules 
about 6auca (bodily purity), acara (rules of conduct in every day 
life), the offering (of fuel-stick) in fire and sarhdhya adoration. Yaj. 
1. 15 is to the same effect. Though the words acarya, guru 7n and 
upadhyaya are very often used as synonyms, ancient writers 
made a distinction between them. According to Manu II. 141 
and 142, an upSdhyftya is one who teaches to a student a por- 
tion of the Veda or the Vedangas 775 (subsidiary lores of the

Veda ) as a means of his own livelihood and a guru is one who 
performs the samskaras and who maintains the child. This 
latter definition Bhows that guru means the father here. Vas. 
Dh. S. ( III. 22-23 ), Visnu Dh. S. 29. 2, and Yaj. I. 35 define 
upadhyaya in the same way as Manu. According to Yaj. 1. 34 the 
guru is one who performs the samskaras and imparts the Veda. 
This corroborates the statement made above that originally the 
t father himself taught the Veda to his son. The word guru is 
often used in the sense of any elderly person, male or female, 
who is entitled to respect. Visnu Dli. 77e S. ( 32. 1-2 ) says that 
the father, the mother and the acarya are the three highest 
gurus of a person and Manu II. 227-237 contain tha most 
sublime glorification of these three, Devala 777 says that ' among 
gurus five deserve special honour, viz. father, mother, acarya, 
eldest brother and husband ( in the case of women ) \ Manu 
( II. 149 ) says that whoever confers on another the benefit of 
knowledge, whether great or small, is the latfcer's guru. 

A great deal is said about the qualifications of the acarya 
who is to perform the upanayana of a person and to teach him 
the Veda. Ap. Dh. S. 778 1. 1. 1. 11 refers to a Brahmana text to 
the effect * he whom a teacher devoid of learning initiates 
enters from darkness into darkness and be also ( i. e. an acarya ) 
who is himself unlearned ( enters into darkness)/ Ap. Dh. S. 
( I. 1. 1. 12-13 ) further provides that one should desire a 
performer of one's upanayana who is endowed with learning 
and whose family is hereditarily learned and who is serene in 
mind and that one should study Vedio lore under him up to 
the end ( of brahmacarya ) as long as the teacher does not fall 
off from the path of dharma. Vyasa ( quoted in Sam. P. p. 408 ) 
says 779 that the acarya should be a brahmana who is solely

devoted to the Veda, who knows dharma, is born of a good family , 
who is pure, is a srotriya that has studied his Vedic Sakha and 
who is not lazy. Srotriya has been defined above (/. w. 290 ). 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 4 and Baud. gr. I. 7. 3 define a srotriya as one 
who has studied one sakha of a Veda. Vide Vayupurana vol. I. 
59. 29 also. 780 The acarya in upanayana must be a brahmana ; as 
to the study of veda one should ordinarily learn the Veda from a 
brahmana teacher ; in times of difficulty ( i. e. when a brahmana 
is not available ) one may learn the Veda from a ksatriya or 
vaisya teacher; but in such circumstances the only service that a 
brahmana student rendered to the guru would be following after 
the non-brahmana teacher ; he had not to render bodily service 
(such as shampooing or washing the feet &c). Vide Ap. Dh.S.II. 
2. 4. 25-28 (quoted above in note 229), Gaut. 7. 1-3, Baud. Dh. S. 
1.2,40-42, Manu II. 241. Manu II. 238 allows even a brahmana 
to learn 6ubha vidya ( visibly beneficial knowledge ) even from 
aSildra. Santiparva 165. 31 does the same. 781 The Mit. on 
Yaj. 1. 118 remarks that a ksatriya or vaisya should teach a 
brahmana only when urged by him and not at his sweet will. 
Apararka ( p. 160 ) says that Manu II. 241 allows only teaching 
to a ksatriya, but does not allow him to make it a means of his 
livelihood. 782 

We saw above (p. 321) that the instruction was entirely oral 
The first thing that was taught to the boy was the pranava and the 
vy&hrtis and the Gayatrl. Then the boy was to be taught othei 
parts of the Veda. It is desirable to set out briefly the method 
of teaching the Veda followed in ancient times. The San. gr 
( IV. 8 ) describes the method as follows : the teacher sits facing 
the east or north, while the other ( i. e. the student ) sits to his 
right facing the north or two students may sit in that way : 
but if there are more than two they should sit as the available 
space will allow. 788 The student should not sit on a high seal

before the teacher nor on the same seat with him ; he should 
not stretch out his feet, nor should he sit seizing his knees with 
his arm, nor should he lean against a support, nor should he 
place his feet on his lap nor should he hold his feet like an axe. 
After the student utters ' Recite, Sir,' 784 the teacher should 
urge him to pronounce * om ' ; the other ( i. e. the student ) 
should reply *om\ Thereafter he (the student) should 
recite continuously. After reciting he should clasp the 
teacher's feet and say 'we have finished, Sir' and go away to his 
business, Some teachers say that the teacher should say ' Leave, 
let us stop \ In the Rk Pratis&khya, 785 15th patala, there is a 
description of the method of teaching the Veda, which closely 
agrees with the above quotation from the San. gr. It adds 
that the teacher may also sit facing the north-east. When the 
teacher recites two words or more, the first pupil ( to the right of 
the teacher) repeats the first of the two or more words 
and the other pupils repeat the rest afterwards. The teacher 
recites one word if it is a compound, two words if they are 
un-compounded; the teacher also clearly explains how to recite 
I the words if there is any difficulty ; in this way the whole 
l prasna is finished and all the pupils repeat again the whole of 
it. A prasna generally has three mantras and each adhyftya 
has about sixty prasnas. Manu ( II. 70-74 ) also prescribes 
certain rules : the student should sip water ( acamana ) when 
about to begin Vedic study, should face the north, should fold 
both hands 78 ' together (and place them on his knee), should 
wear light ( pure ) clothes, should at the beginning and end of 
Vedic study clasp the feet of the teacher with crossed hands 



784. According to the com. ?iWFm on Sail. gr. II. 5. 10-11 ( S. B. E. 
vol. 29 p. 67 /. n. ) the words 'apsftTtift:' are uttered by the teacher.

and should touch the right foot of the teacher with his own 
right hand and left foot with the left hand, should repeat 
1 om ' at the beginning and at the end of Vedio study. The 
teacher should say to the pupil ' repeats and should sfcop from 
teaching with the words ' let there be a pause \ Gaut. (I. 49-58) 
gives similar rules. The Gopatha Br. I. 31 uses the expression 
* sarve veda mukhato grhltah. \ which is current even in 
modern times ( ifc means all Vedas were committed to memory 
by word of mouth ). 

The study of the Veda was the first duty of every twice â 
born person (dvijati). Vedic Literature had grown to vast 
proportions even in the times of the Tai. Br. ( III. 10. 11 ), as the 
story of Indra and Bharadvaja cited above (p. 271 ) shows. The 
ideal was set up by Manu II. 165 , viz. that the whole Veda together 
with secret doctrines ( Upanisads ) was to be learnt by every 
dvijati. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 7 contains a eulogy of Veda study 
(svadhyaya) and the injunction ' svadhyayosdhyetavyah. 
( one must study the Veda ) occurs there very frequently. The 
Ap. Dh. S. (I. 4. 12. 1 and 3) quotes 787 the Tai. A. II. 14. 3 that the 
study of the Veda ( svadhyaya ) is austerities and also the Sat. 
Br. XL 5. 6. 8. The Mahabhasiya ( vol. I. p. 1 ) quotes a Vedic 
text ' a brahmana should study and understand without any 
purpose ( or desire of reward ) dharma and the Veda with its 
six angas.* m The Mahabharata says that a brahmana may be 
deemed to have completely accomplished his duty by the study 
of the VeJa. 789 Yaj. I. 40 says that it is Veda alone that 
confers the highest bliss upon dvijatis by enabling them to 
understand and perform sacrifices, austerities and auspicious 
acts ( like sarhskaras ). The Mahabhasya ( vol. I. p. 9 ) contains 
the traditional extent of the four Vedas, viz. that there were 101 
Sakhas of the Yajurveda, 1000 of the Samaveda, 21 of the 
Bgveda and nine of the Atharvaveda. 79 Â° Concessions had to be

made to the shortness of human life and the weakness of the 
human mind. Therefore Gaut. II. 51, Vas. Dh. S. VII. 3, Manu 

III. 2, Yaj. I. 52 and others allowed a person to study only- 
one Veda. After a man studied his own Veda, he oouid if so 
minded study another &akha of another Veda or other Vedas. 
The rule laid down by many smrtis is that one should study 
the sakha of the Veda which his ancestors studied and should 
parform religious rites with mantras derived from that sakhS. 
Vide Medhatithi on Manu III. 2 and Vigvarupa on Yaj. I. 51. 791 
That person who does not study a Vedio $&kha studied by his 
ancestors and studies another Sakha altogether was called 
' SakhSranda \ Whatever religious rites a man did with the 
procedure and mantras of another sakha* giving up his own 
6akha becomes fruitless. But an exception was made to the 
effect that if some m religious rite was omitted in one's sakha, 
but was dealt with in another sakha and was not opposed to the 
teaching of one's sakha, it may be performed as in the case of 
Agnihotra ( which is not dealt with in all sakhas, but is to be 
performed by all ). 

Teachers mostly confined themselves to one place. But we 
find that even in ancient times there were teachers who 
wandered from one country to another. In the Kaus. Br. Up. 

IV. 1 we find that the famous Balaki Gargya moved about in 
the countries of Uslnara, Mafcsya, Kuru-Pancala and Kfisivi- 
deha. In the Br. Up. III. 3. 1 Bhujyu Lahyayani tells 
Yajfiavalkya that he and others wandered about in the country 
of Madra for study. Students generally stuck to one teacher ; 
but it appears that they sometimes flocked to renowned teachers 
as waters flow down a slope 7M ( Tai. Up. I. 4. 3 ). There were 
also students who wandered from teacher to teacher and were

therefore derisively called * tlrthakaka ( crows at a saored 
place),' as the Mahftbhasya states.â¢ 

As the study of the Veda was a duty enjoined upon a 
brahmana, so teaching Veda to another was a duty. Medhatithi 
on Manu ( II. 113 ) quotes a Vedic text 7 *' 'He who having 
studied the Veda would not teach one who requests him to do so 
would be one who destroys his own good acts ( i.e. would lose 
the benefit thereof), would shut the door leading to happiness; 
therefore he should teach ; it leads to great glory \ When 
Satyakama Jabala did not teach his pupil Upakosala anything 
for twelve years, though the latter served assiduously by 
attending to the sacred fires of the teacher, the teacher's wife 
remonstrated with the husband by saying * this student has 
worked hard and attended the fires, may the fires not censure 
you and order you to teach him the vidya he desires' 
(Chan. Up. IV. 10. 1-2). The Prasna Up. w VI. 1 gives 
expression to the view that if a teacher keeps back anything he 
knows he dries up entirely. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 2-3 
expressly proscribes * the teacher whom a student asks for 
instruction should not refuse him, if he finds no defect in the 
student.' 797 Â£p. Dh. S. (I. 2. 8. 25-28) lays down certain 
excellent rules for the teacher ' the teacher, anxious for the 
welfare of the student as if he were his son, should atten- 
tively impart learning to the student without hiding anything 
from him in all matters of duty ; nor should the teacher 
restrain the student for his own work in such a way as to cause 
obstacles in his study except in seasons of distress. A teacher 
becomes no teacher if he avoids giving instruction * ( i. e. he 
may be abandoned ). The Dronaparva ( 50. 21 ) says that a 
pupil comes only after the son according to the idea of those

who know dharma. If a teacher does not teach a pu${I any- 
thing even after his pupil has stayed with him for a year, -stke 
former receives all the sins of the pupil. A teacher m who did 
not teach or was sinful was to be abandoned. Similarly a 
teacher, who became puffed up, did not care for what should or 
should not be done and took to a sinful path was to be 
abandoned. 799 ip. 1. 1. 1. 13 lays down that a student must 
stay with his teacher who performs his upanayana till he 
completes his study, unless the teacher himself swerved from 
the path of dharma and became a sinner and ( I. 2. 7. 26 ) that 
if the teacher cannot teach the subject, the pupil may resort 
to another teacher. 

The smrtis lay down rules about the qualifications of a 
student who deserves to be taught. In the Vidyasukta quoted in 
the Nirukta 800 ( II. 4 ) we see that the teacher was not to impart 
vidya" (knowledge) to one who was jealous (or who treated vidya 
with contempt), was crooked and was not self-restrained and that 
learning was to be imparked to one who was pure, attentive, 
intelligent and endowed with brahmacarya ( celibacy ), who 
would never prove false ( to his teacher ) and who would guard 
what he learnt as a treasure. Manu (II. 109 and 112 also) 
says that ten persons deserve to be taught viz. the son of the 
teacher, a student who serves his guru, one who gives some 
knowledge in exchange, one who knows dharma or who is pure 
( in body and mind ), who is truthful, who is able to study and 
retain it, who gives money ( for teaching ), who is well-disposed 
and who is one's near relative ( agnate ). Yaj. I. 28 mentions 
all these and adds that the student must be grateful, not 
inclined to hate or prove false to the teacher, healthy and not 
disposed to find fault. The student should always be dependent

on and under the control of the teacher (as Ap. Dh. S. 801 1 1. 2. 19 
and NSrada say ) and should stay with no one but the teacher. 
We saw above (p. 274) that from ancient times the student had to 
serve the teacher by tending his cattle ( Ch&ndogya IV. 4. 5), had 
to beg for food and announce it to the teacher ( ibid. IV. 3. 5 ) 
and to look after his sacred fires and to learn the Veda only 
in the time that would be left after doing work for the guru BQi . 
Besides these, the rules concerning his conduct towards the 
teacher, the teacher's wife and son, concerning the method 
of salutation and showing respect, the food, drinks, and actions 
allowed or prohibited to students are too numerous to be set out 
in detail. A few important ones from Gautama, Ap, Dh. S., 
Manu II and Ysj L 33 are stated below. Gaut. ( II. 13, 14, 18, 
19, 22, 23, 25) says that the student should speak the truth, bathe 
everyday, should not look at the sun; should avoid honey, flesh, 
perfumes, the wearing of flowers, sleeping by day, rubbing oil on 
the body, putting collyrium in the eyes, going in a cart, 803 
wearing shoes and holding an umbrella, love affairs, anger, 
covetousness, infatuation, vain discussions, playing on musical 
instruments, luxurious baths with hot water, meticulous cleans- 
ing of the teeth, ecstatic states of mind, dancing, singing, 
calumny of others, dangerous places, gazing at women or 
touching young women, gambling, serving a low person ( or 
doing very low work ), injury to animals, obscene or harsh 
talk, wine. Manu ( II. 198 and 180-181 ) prescribes that he 
should not sleep on a cot and should observe complete celibacy, 
but if he suffers from night emissions he should bathe, worship 
the sun and repeat thrice the mantra c punar mam ' ( Tai. Ar. 
I. 30 ). The Ap. Dh. S. ( 1. 1. 2. 21-30, 1. 1. 3. 11-24 ) contains 
similar rules of conduct. Ap. says ( I. 1. 2, 28-30 ) that the 
student should not wash his limbs with hot water ( generally ), 
but he may do so if they are smeared with dirty and impure 
matter provided he does it out of the sight of the teacher and 
that he should not bathe in water in a sportive manner, but

should bathe in it motionless like a stick. Ap. not only prohibits 
for him sexual intercourse (I. 1. 2. 26 ) but ordains that he 
should speak with women only as much as is absolutely neces- 
sary. The student was not to 804 laugh, but if he could not help 
laughing he should do so covering his face with his hands 
( says Ap. ). 

Gautama and Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 2. 34 and 37 ) say that the 
student is to serve his teacher by following after him when he 
goes anywhere, he should help the teacher in his toilet and 
bath and should shampoo his body and take food left by him 
( ucchista ) ; 805 he should be diligent in doing work that would 
be pleasing and beneficial to the teacher ; he was to study when 
the teacher called him, he was not to cover his throat with a 
piece of cloth, or was not to sit in the presence of his teacher 
with his feet on his lap, was not to stretch his feet, he was not 
to clear loudly his throat, nor to laugh, yawn or crack the 
knuckles ; he was when called by the teacher to reply at once 
leaving his seat or bed and was to approach the teacher even 
when he called from a distance ; he should always occupy a 
seat lower than that of his teacher and should go to sleep after 
his teacher and rise before him ( Gautama II. 20-21, 30-32 ). 
Manu II. 194-198 and Ap, Dh. S. I 2. 5. 26 and L 2, 6. 1-12 
contain similar rules. Manu ( II. 199 ) says that a pupil should 

804. Vide Ya*j. I. 33 which contains many of the above. YSj. forbids 
the eating of ncchi^ta (leavings of food) of anybody (except the 
teacher). Manu (11.177-179) practically contains the same rules as 
those of Gautama set out above. Audanasa-smrtf III. (ed. by Jiv. 
pp. 512-513) contains a long list of what the student should eschew.

805. The word * occbi^ta ' is used, as exhaustively pointed out by 
MedhStitht on Manu VI. 80, in several senses. It literally means 'what 
is left out.' The most usual senses are three, viz. (1) food left in the 
plate from which one has eaten, (2) food taken out in a vessel for serv- 
ing to a person but not exhausted by being served in his plate, and ( as 
applied to a person), (3) one who has not washed his hands, and mouth 
after eating food ( or as applied to a plate ) the plate ( not yet cleaned ) 
from which one has taken his. meal. Vide ?rg IV. 211 for the 2nd 
meaning. Another meaning is s (4) one who has answered a call of 
nature and not yet performed the purificatory acts like Scamana is 
said to be ucohi^a. Vide Manu IV. 14* (for this and the Brd meaning ) 
andV. 143 (for 3), Sometimes the word is used 2n its literal sense 
(vide Ap. Dh.S.I.1.4. 2). Vide Manu V, 141 for another appli- 
cation of the word. 



Oh. VII ] Rules of conduct for a student 333 

not mimic the gait, the manner of speeoh and the actions of the 
teacher. Manu ( II. 200-201 ) calls upon the pupil to close his 
ears ( with his bands or fingers ) or to leave the place where 
somebody indulges in calumnies about the teacher or points out 
the faults in him, and states that if the pupil himself finds 
fault with his teaoher or calumniates him, the pupil ( in the 
next life ) is born as an ass or a dog. Visnu Dh. 8. 80 ' 28. 26 
says the same. 

Some rules are laid down as to how the brahmacarin is to 
deal with the hair on his head. Even the Rg. speaks of boys 
with several sikhas (topknot). Vide note 598 above. Gaut. I. 26 
and Manu II. 219 say that a brahmao&rin may either shave 
his entire head, or may allow all the hair to grow as matted or 
should keep only a tuft of hair on the head ( and shave the 
rest ). 807 Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 2. 31-32, Vas. VII. 11 allow only two 
alternatives viz. growing all the hair or keeping a tuft of hair, 
while Visnu Dh. S. 28. 41 says that a student may either shave 
the entire head or grow matted hair. One was not to untie 
one's sikha, while on the public road. 808 

One of the rules for the student was that he. was not to 
pronounce the name of his teacher even when the teacher was 
not present without prefixing or affixing an honorific addition 
( such as sri, bhafta, ftc&rya ). Gaut. ordains that the student 
should not speak of his teacher, the teacher's son or wife or of a 
man who has been initiated for a srauta sacrifice by their 
barejnames 800 and then says that when it is absolutely necessary

to refer to these by name the student should not pronounce 
the name and gotra of his teacher as they are, but by means of 
a synonym ( e. g. if the teacher's name is Haradatta or Deve6- 
vara the pupil should respectively say Devarata or Suresvara ). 
Ap. Dh. S. L 2. 8. 15 says that even after returning home a 
snataka should avoid touching his former teacher with his 
fingers (to call his attention), frequent muttering of something 
in his ears, laughing into his face, calling him out loudly, 
taking his name, ordering him about. Manu II. 128 and Gaut. 
VI. 19 say that a man who has been initiated for a sirauta 
sacrifice should not be addressed by his name, even though he 
be younger than the person addressing, but that one should use 
the words ' bhoh ' and ' bhavat * when addressing him or speak- 
ing about him and may refer to him by words like dlksita &c. 
There are other rules about addressing or referring by name 
which may be set out here for the sake of completeness. The 
Sm. C. ( I. p. 45 ) and Haradatta on Gaut. II. 29 quote a smrti 810 
that one should not mention by name only one's teacher, 
teacher's son and wife, a dlksita, any other guru, father, mother, 
paternal and maternal uncles, one's benefactor, a learned man , 
one's father-in-law, one's husband, one's mother's sister. The 
Mahabharata says that one should not mention by name or 
address as ' tvam ' ( thou ) one's elders, but one may speak of 
one's contemporaries or those who are younger by their names. 81 1 
Another verse says that one should not mention one's own 
name, the name of one's guru, the name of a mean person, of 
one's wife and one's eldest child. 

Upasamgrahana consists in repeating one's gotra and name, 
saying 'I salute', touching one's ears, olasping the feet (as 
stated above ) and bending one's head while so doing. In 
abhtvadana there is no clasping of the feet with the hands > one

may or may not touch the feet of the person to be honoured. 
Abhivadana must always be preceded by pratyutthana.* 18 

Very detailed rules were laid down about pratyutthana 
( rising from one's seat to receive a person ), abhivadana ( salut- 
ing a man), upasamgrahana (saluting by clasping the feet of the 
teacher or another with one's hands ), pratyabhivada ( returning 
a salutation), and namaskara (bowing with the word * namah * ). 
According to Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2. 5. 19 and I. 3. 10. 17 the student must, 
when he meets his teaoher after sunrise, clasp his teacher's feet 
and also before beginning the day's lesson of Vedic study and 
also after finishing it. Manu II. 71 says the same. Gaufc. (1. 52-54) 
prescribes the clasping of the feet every day in the morning 
and at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the Veda. 
According to Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2.5, 20 on other occasions whenever the 
student meets the teacher only abhivadana is sufficient, though 
according to some teachers (Ap. I. 2. 5. 21) clasping the teacher's 
feet is necessary on each oocasion. Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. %l states 
that in upasamgrahana the teacher's right foot is to be stroked 
below and above with the student's right hand and the foot and 
ankle are both to be taken hold of, while according to some 
teachers, the student must press each foot of the teaoher with both 
hands and clasp them. Manu II. 72, VisnuDh. S. 28. 15, and Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 2. 24 say that the student is to clasp the feet of the 
teacher with crossed hands, touching the right foot with the 
right hand and the left foot with the left hand. Kulluka on 
Manu II. 72 quotes Paithlnasi that the student should clasp the 
teacher's feet with his hands turned upwards. Baud. Dh. S. 
I. 2. 28 adds that clasping should not be done when either the 
teaoher or the pupil is seated, or is lying down or impure. Acc- 
ording to Gaut. VI. 1-3 one must clasp every day on the first 
meeting and particularly on his or their return from a journey* 
the feet of one's parents, of the blood relations of parents ( e. g. 
paternal and maternal uncles ), of the elder brother, of the guru 
( i. e. acStrya, upadhyiya ) and of persons venerated by one's 
gurus. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 4. 14. 7-9) says that even after finishing

one's studies and returning home a man must every day clasp 
the feet of gurus ( father, mother, teacher and other venerable 
persons ) and of elder brothers and sisters according to their 
seniority. 

Abhivadana is of three kinds, viz. nitya ( obligatory every 
day ), naimittika ( to be done only on certain occasions ) and 
kamya ( to be done only if a person has certain rewards in 
view )â¢ As examples of nitya abhivadana one may instance 
the rules of Ap. Dh. S. 813 ( I. 2. 5. 12-13 ) " every day a student 
should get up from bed in the last watch of the night and 
standing near his teacher salute him with the words * I so and 
so, ho ' ( salute thee ) ; and the student should also salute other 
very aged (and learned brahraanas) who may reside in the same 
village before his morning meal." Yaj. I. 26 also speaks of the 
latter. The occasional abhivadana is done on certain occasions 
such as return from a journey ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 14 ). A person 
may salute elderly persons whenever he chooses, if he is 
desirous of long life or ( bliss in ) heaven ( Ap. Dh. S. L 2. 5. 15 
and Baud. Dh, S. I. 2. 26 ). Manu 8U ( II. 120 and 121 ) says 
4 the prSnas ( vital breaths ) of a young man mount upwards 
when an old man approaches ; but by rising to meet him and 
salutation ( to him ), he ( the young man ) recovers them. He 
who habitually salutes and constantly pays reverence to the 
aged obtains an increase of four things viz. length of life, 
knowledge, fame and strength/ Ap. Dh. S, I. 4. 14. II, 815 Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 2. 44, Manu II. 130 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 41 prescribe 
that a person must honour by rising and mentioning one's name 
an officiating priest, one's father-in-law, paternal and maternal 
uncles, even though these may be younger than oneself in

years. Gaut. ( VI. 9 ) however says that in the case of these 
one need only rise from his seat to receive them ; but it is not 
necessary to salute them ( abhivadana is not necessary ). Visnu 
Dh. S. 32. 4 expressly says that in the case of officiating priests 
and others specified by Ap. and Gaut. and who are younger, 
rising from one's seat is tantamount to abhivadana. Manu II. 
117 says that one must perform abhivadana to a person from 
whom one learns secular, Vedic or spiritual knowledge of any 
kind. There is some difference in the words used at the time of 
abhivadana. Usually the words are ' abhivadaye devadatta- 
sarma-ham 8,<5 bhoh' (vide Ap. I. 2.5.12, Gaut. VI. 5, Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 2. 27, Vas. XIII. 44, Manu II. 122 and 124 ). But this 
mode is appropriate only if the person addressed knows how to 
return the salutation. Manu II. 123 and 126 and Vas. Dh. 8. 
13. 45 declare that in the case of those who do not know how 
to return a salutation (pratyabhivadana, and according to Manu 
in the case of women also ) one should omit the word ' bhoh * 
and simply say * abhivadaye aham * ( omitting one's name ). 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 20 similarly says that in saluting women, 
a ksatriya or a vaisya one should use a pronoun and omit 
one's name. 817 

The manner of abhivadana was as follows : 818 4 A brahmana 
shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a level with 
his ear, a ksatriya holding it on a level with the chest, a vaisya 
holding it on a level with the waist and a sudra holding it low 
( up to his feefc ) and that the salutation shall be by joining 
one's hands ' ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 16-17 ). The Madanaparijata 
adds that abhivadana is with both hands when the person to be 
saluted is learned, but wifch one hand only if he is not learned 
( p. 27 ) and the Sm. C. ( I. p. 36 ) quotes Visnu and Atri to the 



816. That is ono has to take one's name in abhivadana; but one 
does not take the name of the person who is saluted (Gautama VI. 12 ). , 
The ;F$?*r*f*m p. 7 says that in ^nhrgot ( and in arf^T^r also ) the

same effeofc. The stretching of the hands up to the ear &o. 
indicates how far the head is to be bent in each case. 

There were also other rules about honouring one's elders 
in the presence of one's teacher or honouring the teacher's 
teacher or about one's behaviour when a gentleman comes to 
see one's acarya and leaves him, which are here passed over for 
want of space. Vide Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 6. 29-32, Manu II. 205. 

A brahmana who does not know the form of returning a 
salutation must not be saluted by a learned man ; he is like a 
sudra (Manu II. 126). Similarly a brahmana was not to perform 
abhivadana to a ksatriya or a vaisya however learned the latter 
may be, but one should simply say 'svasti*; those who are of 
the same caste should do abhivadana. 819 The Mit. on Yaj. III. 
292 and Apararka p. 1188 quote sutras of Harlfca prescribing 
as pr&yascitta a fast of one, two or three days respectively for a 
brahmana saluting a ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and also for 
saluting when the persons saluted or the man saluting are in 
such a condition as to make them unfit for abhivadana. One 
should not salute with the shoes on or when one's head is 
wrapped up or one's hands are full ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 19 ) ; or 
if one carries a load of fuel-sticks or holds a pot of flowers or 
food in one's hands one shall not salute, nor shall one salute 
on occasions similar to the preceding (such as one being 
engaged in worship of manes, of fire or other gods or when one's 
teacher is so engaged), nor should one salute a teacher standing 
very close to him ( Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 31-32 ). When one is 
impure or the person he meets is impure ( owing to asauca or 
other causes ) no salutation is to be made or returned ( Ap. Dh. 
S. I. 4. 14. 17 ). Gaut. IX. 45 says that one should not occupy 
a seat or perform abhivadana and namaskara with shoes on. 
One need not salute a person who is not a guru or who stands 
in a lower or higher place than oneself (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 14 ). 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 23, Manu II. 135 and Visnu Dh. S. 32. 17 
say that a brahmana ten years old is like a father to a ksatriya 
even 100 years old and so deserves salutation from the ksatriya.

Ch. VII ] Rules about abhivadana 339 

Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 4. 14. 12 ) gives a special rule that a friendship 
kept for ten years as fellow citizens, a friendship contracted 
at school for five years, the fact of a srotriya being three 
years older entities the friend or srotriya to a salutation. But 
Gaut. ( VI. 14-17 ) and Manu II. 134 give somewhat different 
rules viz. contemporaries who are born in the same year are to 
be addressed with the word * bhoh ' or ' bhavat ' and a fellow 
citizen who is ten years older than oneself and an artist who is 
five years older than oneself and a Srotriya studying the same 
Vedio school as oneself who is three years older are to be 
addressed similarly. Manu adds blood relations to the list 
when the difference in age is very small. The Smrtyarthasara 
p. 7 gives a long list of persons whom one should never salute 
viz. an heretic, a person guilty of grave sins, an atheist, 
gamblers, thieves, ungrateful persons, drunkards. Vide also 
Manu IV. 30 and Yaj. 1. 130 ( as to showing no respeot even by 
words to heretics &c ). 

In the case of certain persons one was to show honour only 
by rising from his seat and not by abhivadana. Gaut. ( VI. 9 ) 
mentions some such persons who are already referred to in note 
815. He adds that (VI. 10-11) even a sudraof eighty years or more 
must be honoured by rising by one ( even though the latter be 
of a higher varna ) young enough to be his son ( but there will 
be no abhivadana ) and that an arya ( i. e. one belonging to the 
three higher castes ) must be honoured by rising by a 6udra even 
if the latter be older ( and so a vaisya must honour a ksatriya 
though the latter be younger ). Haradatta explains that the 
word sudra in Gaut. VI, 10 is only illustrative and that an old 
vaisya must be honoured by a young ksatriya or brShmana by 
simply rising from his seat and an old ksatriya by a young 
brahmana in the same way. Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 4. 16-18) lays 
down that if a brahmana who has not studied the Veda comes 
as a guest one may give him a seat, water and food but one 
should not rise to receive him, but should rise to receive him 
if he is entitled to abhivadana on account of age ( as stated in 
Ap. I. 4. 14. 12, and Manu II. 134 ) ; similarly a brfihmana 
need not rise to receive a ksatriya or vaisya ( except on the 
same ground of age ). 

The rules about returning a salutation (about pratyabhivada] 
are made somewhat intricate and obscure by the varying 
interpretations of commentators. Pratyabhivada consists in 
pronouncing a benediction in the proper form given by a gun 



340 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. VII 

or other person who has been saluted. Among the oldest 8 * is 
the rule in Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 18 * when returning the salute of 
one belonging to the first three castes, the ( last syllable of the ) 
name ( of the person whose salutation is to be returned ) shall 
be lengthened to three moras \ Vasistha's rule ( XIII. 46 ) 
is ' when the salute is returned, the last vowel ( of the noun 
standing ) in the vocative is protracted to the length of three 
moras and if it is a diphthong ( i. e. e or o but not of the dual 
number ) it becomes ' ay ' or ' av ' e. g. ' bho becomes bhav *. 
Manu II. 125 prescribes " a brahmana should be thus saluted in 
return, ' mayst thou be long-lived, O gentle one ! * and the vowel 
* a ' or any other vowel at the end of the name ( of the person 
addressed ) should be made pluta (i.e. lengthened to three moras) 
and if the name ends in a consonant, the preceding vowel 
is made pluta" 

That these rules are very ancient follows from Panini's 
sutra ( VIII. 2. 83 ) ' when the salutation of a person who is not 
a sudra is returned by the person saluted, the final vowel in the 
name ( that occurs at the end of the sentence of pratyabhivada ) 
becomes 1 pluta. 9 The MahabhSsya comments on this and two 
vartikas thereon say that this rule does not apply when it is 
a woman to whom the salutation is returned and it applies 
optionally when the person whose salutation is returned is a 
ksatriya or vaisya. All these rules are exemplified in the 
foot-note below. 821 Ap. Dh. S. agrees with this rule of the 
ancient grammarians. The verse of Manu ( II. 125 ) also really 
means the same thing ; but there the word ' akara' is only

illustrative 88 * and stands for all vowels. The ancient com- 
mentator Medhatithi interprets Manu so as to agree with Pacini 
and says ' in the realm of the use of words and their senses 
Panini has higher authority than Manu, that the pratyabhivada 
words containing the benediction about long life are not 
stereotyped, that when a ksatriya returns the salutation of a 
ksatriya or a vaisya of a vaisya, the same rules hold good \ As 
a person of a higher varna was not to do abhivadana to one of 
lower varna ( vide note 819 above ) there would be no occasion 
for pratyabhivada from the side of the latter. The verse of 
Manu is interpreted by Haradatta and a few others in a 
different manner. According to them the last vowel in the 
name of the person whose salutation is to be returned is pluta 
and then ' a * is added to it, and that if the vocative ends in e 
or o, it becomes aya or ava ( with ' a * added ). 88S This view is 
opposed to Panini, the Mahabhasya, the Kasika, Apastamba and 
several writers of digests. Apararka and the Sm. C. condemn 
the interpretation put upon Manu's verse by commentators 
like Haradatta. 824 

What great importance was attached to the correct utter- 
ance of the return salutation can be seen from the fact that one 
of the miscellaneous reasons assigned for the necessity of 
grammatical studies in the Mahabhasya is that ( as stated in a 
verse ) a person who returns from a journey will perform 
salutation to ignorant persons (who do not know how to utter 
pratyabhivada ) as if to women with the words 'abhivfidaye

ayamaham ' 885 (i. e. grammar is to be learnt by men for fear 
that they may be treated as women when a person salutes 
them). 

Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 2. 7. 27 ) prescribes that the Btudent shall be- 
have towards his teacher's wife as towards the teacher himself* 
but he shall not clasp her feet or eat the residue of her food. 888 
Gaut. ( II. 31-32 ) also says the same thing and adds that the 
student shall not assist the wives of the teacher at their toilet 
or bath nor wash their feet nor shampoo them. Manu II. 211, 
Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 37, Visnu Dh. S. 32. 6 have the same rule. 
But Gaut. II. 33 states an exception that on return from a 
journey the student shall clasp the feet of the wives of his 
teacher (also Manu II. 217 and Visnu Dh. S. 32. 15). Manu (II. 210) 
gives special directions ' the wives of the teacher who belong to 
the same caste must be treated as respectfully as the teacher 
but in the case of those who belong to a different caste he need 
only rise from his seat and salute ' ( Visnu Dh. S. 32. 5 also is 
similar ), and * a student who is full twenty years old shall not 
honour the young wife of a teacher by clasping her feet ( Manu 
11.212 and Visnu Dh. S. 32.13); but even a young student 
may prostrate himself on the ground for honouring the young 
wife of his teacher without clasping her feet ( with the words 
' abhivadaye amuka^arma-ham bhoh ' ). 

As regards women who are not wives of the teacher, 
the following rules deserve attention. The first rule is that 
married women, whatever their age may be, deserve honour 
( and so he must salute &c. ) according to the ages of their 
husbands 827 ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 18 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 42 ). 
Visnu Dh. S. 32. 2 gives the same rule, but restricts it to wives 
of the same caste. Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 6 prescribes that the 
same honour must be shown to the mother and father as to a 
teacher i. e. their feet must be elapsed on those occasions on 
which a teacher's feet are to be olasped and Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 9 
extends the rule to elder sisters. Gaut. ( VI. 7-8 ) states that 
the feet of the wives of (elder) brothers or of one's mother-in-law

need not be clasped on any occasion; and the feet of a 
paternal uncle's wife or of elder sisters need not be clasped 
except when one returns from a journey. But Manu (II. 131-132) 
gives different rules. A maternal or poternal aunt, a maternal 
uncle's wife, a mother-in-law are equal to one's teacher's wife 
and must be honoured like her ; one's elder brother's wife's feet 
must be clasped every day if she is of the same caste, but the 
feet of the wives of one's other paternal and maternal relatives 
need only be clasped on one's return from a journey. Visnu 
Dh. S. 32. 3 places a maternal or paternal aunt and the eldest 
sister on an equality with the teacher's wife. As already stated 
above in the case of all women the salutation is simply *I salute' 
(abhivadaye aham)' without mentioning one's name. Devala 
says * the mother, mother's mother, teacher's wife and the full 
brothers and sisters of one's parents, paternal grand-mother, 
mother-in-law, elder sister and the foster mother are women 
who are ( to be honoured like ) gurus \ 888 

Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 30, Vas. Dh. S. XIII. 54, Visnu Dh. S. 
28. 31, Manu II. 207 require that the student will behave 
towards the teacher's son as towards his teaoher. That this rule 
is very anoient follows from a passage 829 in the MahabhasyaJ 
where it is stated and a proviso is added that the student will 
not however clasp the son's feet nor eat the leavings of his food. 
Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2. 7. 30 only mentions as prohibited the eating of the 
leavings of food, but Visnu Dh. S. (28. 32-33) prohibits also the 
washing of the son's feet. Manu (II. 208) gives a restrictive rule 
that the son of the teacher deserves the same honour as a teacher, 
if he imparts instruction in place of the teacher ( because the 
latter is otherwise engaged ), whether the son be younger or of 
the same age as the student, but that the student in any case 
must not shampoo the limbs of the son nor assist him in his 
bath nor wash his feet nor eat the leavings of his food. 

From Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 28 and I. 4. 13. 12 8 * it appears that

obtained in ancient times and Ap. prescribes that the student 
shall behave towards a pupil teacher who teaches him at the 
teacher's command as towards the teacher and shall honour him 
also by clasping his feet, as long as he is giving instruction. 

Further rules are laid down about showing courtesy to a 
person who is not a relative or who is not a teacher &c. Ap. Dh. 
& I. 4. 14. 26-29 and Manu II. 127 lay down that one should, on 
meeting a brahraana, ask after his health with the word 4 ku&ala/ 
a ksatriya about his health using the word 4 anSmaya \ a vaisya 
by using the word ksema ( or anasja according to Ap. ) and a 
sudra by employing the word arogya. Thus one who is older 
( according to the rule in Manu II. 134 cited above on p. 339 ) 
should be saluted, while one who is of the same age or younger 
should simply be asked 'kusala* &c. Gaut. V. 37-38 gives similar 
directions. 831 Manu ( II. 129 ) enjoins that one should address 
a woman who is the wife of another mart and who is not a blood 
relation as ' lady â¢ ( bhavatl ) or 4 beloved sister ' and ( Ap, Dh. S. 
L 4. 14. 30) that one should not pass a learned brahraana without 
addressing him nor a woman whom he meets in a forest or 
other lonely place and Visnu Dh. S. 32. 7 says that in such 
circumstances he must address her ( in order to assure her ) 
as * sister ' ( if she is of the same age as himself ) or 
1 daughter * ( if she is younger ) and * mother * ( if she is older 
than himself ). 

It is stated in the Udvahatattva 838 (p. 144 ).that the word 
' srl ' is to be prefixed when referring by name to a deity or a 
teacher, to the place of one's teacher, to a holy place or to the 
presiding deity of a holy place, to one who has secured Yogio 
siddhis or to those who have secured by sacrifices the worlds of 
bliss; and Raghunandana adds that according to the usage of 
respectable people * Sri * is prefixed to names of such persons 
while they are alive. The same work also tells us that women 
of the dvijatis were to have the honorific suffix * devl ' added to

Oh. VII ] Grounds for showing respect 345 

their names and of the Audra caste the word * dasl \ This is 
skill the practice particularly in Bengal and Northern India. 

The works on Dharma&astra give very interesting ruleg 
about the grounds on which respect was to be shown to a 
person. Honour 833 consists in saluting a person, or rising to 
meet him or allowing him to walk in front of one or giving him 
a garland, sandal- wood paste on festive occasions and the like* 
Manu ( II. 13G ) and Visnu Dh. S. ( 32. 16 ) say that wealth 
kindred, age, ( performance of ) religious rites and sacred know- 
ledge confer title to respect, but each succeeding one out of 
these five is superior to each preceding one. Gaut. ( VI. 18-20 ) 
is slightly different; he says 'wealth, relations, occupation, 
birth, learning and age must be honoured ; each later named is 
more important than each preceding one ; but Vedic learning is 
more important than all (the rest)'. Vas. Db, S. 13. 56-57 
also says that learning, wealth, age, relationship and religious 
actions are titles to respect, but each preceding one is more 
important than each succeeding one. Yaj. I. 116 puts the order 
as vidyS, karma, age, relationship and wealth ( i. e. wealth is 
the least ground for giving honour ). Vtevarupa on Yaj. L 35 
says that if respect is not paid to guru (parents), ficarya, 
up&dhyaya and rtvik ( they are arranged in descending order ) 
one incurs sin, but if honour is not shown on the ground 
of ^learning, wealth &c. there is no sin but one loses happi- 
ness and success. Manu II. 137 says that a Â§udra who 
is beyond 90 years is still a child to a learned brahmana. 
In order to show that Vedic learning is superior to seniority 
of age Manu ( II. 151-153 ) narrates the story of a young scion 
of the Angiras gotra who taught his pitrs and addressed them as 
'little sons' and whose action was supported by the gods with 
the remark that a man destitute of knowledge was a child and 
he who taught him the Veda was his father. This story is 
referred to expressly by Baud. Dh. S. 1. 4. 47 and tacitly by Gaut. 
VI. 20. It is borrowed from the Tandya Mahabrahmana 824

( 13. 3. 24 ). Mann II. 155 clinches the argument by saying 
' the seniority of brahmanas springs from ( sacred ) knowledge, 
of ksatriyas from valour, of vaisyas from ( the possession ) 
of corn and other wealth and only among sudras is age a 
ground of seniority *. 

Kaut. says that men deserve honour according to their 
learning, intelligence, valour, high birth and eminent deeds. 835 

One has to distinguish between abhiv&dana and namaskara. 
In the former one not only bows but utters words like ' abhi- 
vadaye &c.\ while in the latter one only bows and folds 
one's hands. The latter is done only to images of gods, br&hmanas, 
samnyasins and the like. The Smrfcyarthasara p. 8 prescribes a 
fast for one day as a penance for not bowing to images of gods, 
samnyasins &c. Vis$u 826 ( quoted in the Sm. 0. ) says that one 
should not salute ( abhivadana ) a brahmana, but should only 
perform namaskara in all public assemblies, in sacrifices or in 
palaces or royal courts. The posture of the hands in namaskara 
is stated as follows : ' One should join the hands in the shape of 
a shegoat's ear in namaskara to a learned man, one should fold 
the hands together in bowing to an ascetic, one should salute 
an ignorant man with one hand and should not perform abhi- 
vadana to one who is younger. 827 

One had to show respect by circumambulating 828 from left

Oh. VII ] Learning from books 347 

A matter closely connected with the showing of respect is 
that of the rules about the preference to be given on the road. 
This has already been dealt with in speaking of the privileges 
of brahmanas above pp. 14G-147. 

One striking point about the imparting of knowledge ( par- 
ticularly Vedic) in the ancient educational system of India 
was the great prejudice against learning from books. The 
greatest importance was attached to handing down the Veda 
intact and various devices were discovered and employed for 
securing this end, such as the various modes of repeating the 
Veda only in padas, in the krama, jata and other formations. 
Great care was taken to preserve the proper accentuation of the 
Vedic texts. There is a well known story how Tvasfcr repeating 
the words ' IndraSatrur-vardhasva ' 84 Â° in wrong accents caused 
the fire to be extinguished instead of inflaming it against Indra 
as he intended. This story is alluded to in the Pftninlyasiksa. 
The same work ( in verse 32 ) condemns one who learns from a 
manuscript as among the worst of learners. The Veda was to 
be recited not only with proper modulation of the voice to 
convey the accents, but the accents were indicated also by the 
movements of the fingers ( vide verses 43-45 of the Paninlya- 
6iksa). All these intricate matters could be learnt only by 
oral instruction. 

Great controversies have raged round the question whether 
the art of writing was known in India in very ancient times, 
whether it was used for literary purposes in the times of Pacini 
and whether the Brahml alphabet was an indigenous product or 
whether it was imported into India from some foreign land. Max 
Muller in his ' History of ancient Sanskrit Literature ' started 
the astounding and absurd theory that writing for literary pur- 
poses was unknown to Panini ( p. 507 ). Later on that position

the first word of the compound has the udatta accent ( as in 3*3*1*: ).

was given up. Then Biihler wrote his famous work * on the 
origin of the Brahml alphabet * mainly relying on the resem- 
blances of a few letters of the Asiokan script with an ancient 
Semitic alphabet and came to the conclusion that the Brahml 
alphabet was derived from a Semitic scripb sometimes about 
800 B. 0. It never occurred to that learned scholar to advance 
and carefully examine the other possible hypotheses which any 
unbiassed and cautious scholar should have ordinarily advanced 
viz. that the Semitic script might have been derived from the 
Brahml alphabet and was later on developed or both might have 
been derived from some unknown anoient script. All these 
theories are now in the melting pot on account of the seals 
bearing writing in some undeciphered script found at Mohenjo- 
daro and Harappa, some of which are at least 5000 years old. 
So if the Brahml alphabet was at all borrowed, it is clear 
now that it was not necessary for Indians to travel so far as 
Westernmost Asia for that purpose. 

Oral instruction was the cheapest and most accurate 
method of imparting learning. In ancient times writing 
materials were not easily available and written texts could not 
be handled easily and would have been extremely costly. 
Therefore the method of oral instruction was resorted to and 
having been hallowed by the lapse of thousands of years it has 
been persisted in to the present day. Even in the 20th century 
after writing has been known for not less than 3000 years accord- 
ing to scholars like Biihler there are hundreds of brahmanas who 
learn not only the whole of the Bgveda (about 10580 verses) by 
heart, but also commit to memory the pada 841 text of the Rgveda, 
the Aitareya Brahmana and Aranyaka and the six VedShgas 
( which include the 4000 aphorisms of PSnini and the extensive 
Nirukta of Yaska ) without caring to understand a word of this 
enormous material. 

Par. M. (1. 1. p. 154) quotes a verse of Narada to the effect 848 
' what is learnt from reliance on books and is not learnt from 

841. The pada text of the ijtgveda i8 the work of Sakalya and the 
padapStha is supposed to be pauru?eya (composed by a human author). 
The Nirukta (VI. 28) criticizes 6a"kalya's division of the pada text. 
VidvarUpa on YSj. III. 242 says that pada and krama are of human 
authorship.

condemns to hell those who sell the Veda, who condemn the

which prescribe various prayascifctas for selling the Vedas, the 
ahgas ( of the Veda ), the smrtis, itihasa and purana, the secret 
pancaratra (system), gathas, nltisastras &c. The prejudice 
against using books for learning was carried so far that among 
the six obstacles in the path of the acquirer of knowledge, 
reliance on books is mentioned as one. 844 Apararka ( p. 390 ) 
quotes a long passage from the Bhavisyottarapurana about the 
rewards of gifts of books of the epics and puranas to a 
brahmana or to a matha for the use of the public. A grant of 
the Valabhi king Guhasena I dated 559 A. D. refers to a collec- 
tion of books on the true dharma. 845 In the Kadambarl 
( para 88 ) the queen VilasavatI is described as surrounded by 
ascetic women who held books in their hands and read 
itihasa. 846 Vide under dana and matha-pratistha. 

The teacher was expected to make the student understand

employing the current languages of the various countries. 847 

The Duration of studenthood ( brahmacarya ) : â It appears 
from certain passages of the Upanisads that the usual duration 
of brahmacarya was 12 years 848 . Svetaketu Aruneya is said 
to have become a brahmacarl when he was twelve and to have 
mastered all the Vedas at the age of 24 ( vide Chan. Up. VI, 1. 2

quoted in/, w. 634). Similarly Chan. IV. 10.1 appears to suggest 
that students left their teaoher after twelve years of study. But 
a long period of brahmacarya was not unknown to the sages of 
the Upanisads. Chandogya ( VIII. 11. 3 ) declares that Indra 
remained as a student with Prajapati for 101 years (three periods 
of 32 years plus five ). The story of Bharadvaja narrated 
in the Tai. Br. quoted above ( at p. 271 ) states that Bharadvaja 
studied the Vedas three parts of his life ( at least till 75 years ). 
The Gopatha Brahmana 849 (II. 5 ) states that the period of 
studenthood for learning all the Vedas is 48 years; that 
distributing that period in four portions among the vedas 
student-hood is for 12 years (for mastering one Veda ), that 
period (12 years) is the shortest (for brahmacarya) and that 
one should learn of the Veda as much as one can before he 
is about to return from his teacher. 

Some of the grhya and dharma sufcras oontain these very 
words of the Gopatha Brahmana e. g. Par. gr. II. 5 says * one 
should observe brahmacarya forty-eight years for the ( four ) 
Vedas, or twelve years for each Veda or until one has learnt 
one or more Veda \ The Baud. gr. ( I. 2. 1-5 ) has a very 
suggestive passage " the ancient period of studenthood was 
forty-eight years for ( the four Vedas ) or 24 years, or 12 years 
for each Veda or at least one year for each k&nda ( section of 
the Vedic sarhhitas like the Tai. S. ) or until the student learnt 
( one Veda ), as life is fleeting and as there is a Vedic text ' one 
should consecrate ( the three ) sacred fires, while his hair 
is still dark ". On Jaimini I. 3. 3 Sahara states the objection 
( among other similar matters ) that the smrtis speaking 
of brahmacarya for fortyeight years are opposed to the Vedic 
injunction that * a man who has a son and whose hair is still 
dark should consecrate the ( three drauta ) fires ' ( i. e. he must do 
so in middle life, not when his hair is turning grey ). Sahara 
gives his opinion that such smrtis being opposed to iruti are to

be disregarded 8M and makes fun of them by saying that some 
persons desirous of concealing their lack of manhood observed 
brahmacarya for forty-eight years and the prescriptions in these 
smrtis to that effect are due to this fact. 858 The very orthodox 
KumSrilabhatta could not tolerate this light-hearted statement of 
Sahara and rebukes the latter by saying that there is really no 
contradiction between the iruti text and the smrti passage, since 
the smrtis themselves prescribe other lesser and alternative 
periods, since it is possible to hold that smrtis speak of 
brahmacarya for 48 years only with reference to him who 
wants to become a samnyasin immediately after brahmacarya 
or who desires to become a perpetual student. 852 * 

As the Vedic literature had grown to vast proportions and 
as it was thought necessary to preserve this ancient heritage, 
tbe ancient sages hit upon the plan of enlisting the whole 
population of the three varnas in the task of preservation by 
making.it as their duty to devote as much time as they could 
to the study and conservation of the Vedic literature. Therefore 
various alternatives were proposed viz. studying all the four 
Vedas for 48 years, three of them for 36 or if a man was very 
clever he may finish the study of three Vedas in 18 years or in 
9 years or he should devote as much time as he would require for 
learning one Veda or more. Vide Manu III. 1-2 and Yaj. I. 36 
and 52 for the various alternatives. Spending 12 years for Vedic 

851. As upanayana was usually performed in the 8th year from 
conception or birth, the period of studenthood (if it was to be 48 years) 
would not end till a man became 56. Only a householder could consec- 
rate the drauta fires. So if the man was to marry after fifty-six his hair 
would be turning grey and by following the smrti rule he would run 
counter to the Vedio injunction. Thus smrtis would be opposed to druti 
and Jaimini's conclusion in I. 3. 3 is that when that is the case Bmrti is 
to be disregarded.

study must have been found even in ancient times impossible 
for many among the brahmanas and therefore the Bhfiradvaja 
grhya ( quoted above in note 850 ) allowed the alternative that 
one should study the Veda till the Godana ceremony (which as we 
shall see later on ) took place in the 16th year. Asv. gr, sutra 
L 22. 3-4 also prescribes only two alternatives for brahmacarya 
viz. for 12 years or as long as one oould learn the Veda ( so 
As v. contemplated brahmacarya for less than 12 years), 
Haradatta remarks on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 16 8J * that reading Ap. I, 
1. 2. 12-16, 1. 11. 3. 1 and Manu III. 1 together it follows that 
every one must observe brahmacarya for three years at least 
for each Veda and when it is said that one may observe 
brahmacarya till one learns the Veda, that means beyond 
three years for each Veda. This appears somewhat opposed 
to the words of As v. and Bharadvaja. 

Not only was the study of the Veda made an absolute duty 
for all persons belonging to the three higher varnas, but the 
study of Veda was essential for the performance of the solemn 
Vedic sacrifices. Jaimini 85 * lays down that it is only he who 
knows the Vedic portion necessary for a Vedic sacrifice, that is 
entitled to perform that sacrifice. 

Subjects of Study: â The study of the Veda means the study of 
the Mantras and the Brahmana portion of the particular sakha or 
sakhas. 855 The Veda was deemed to be eternal and not composed 
by any human author (i. e. it is apauruseya). Jaimini in 1. 1. 6-23 
establishes that the relation of word and sense is eternal and 
that ( in 1. 1. 27-32 ) the Vedas are apauruseya. This is not the 
place to set out or examine the arguments. All) dharmasastra 
writers proceed on this axiom of the eternity of the Veda. The 
Vedantasutra (I. 3. 28-29) says that the Vedas are eternal and the 
whole universe ( including the gods ) emanates from the Veda

and reliance is placed on certain Upanisad passages and on 
Manu L 21, Santi-parva 233. 24 and ofcher smrfcis. The Br. Up. 
IV. 5. 11 says that the Vedas are the breath of the great Being 
( i. e. the Supreme Spirit, God ) ; in Br. Up. I. 2. 5 the Creator 
(Praj&pati) is said to have evolved all this viz. Rgveda, 
Yajurveda, Samaveda, yajnas and so forth. The SvetasvataTa 
Up. VI. 18 says that the Supreme Being evolved Brahma and 
imparted the Vedas to him. 856 The Santiparva 857 says that 
speech in the form of Veda is without beginning and without 
end, from which all activities and creation proceed, and that 
the Vedas become latent at the periodical dissolution of the 
world and become manifest to the great sages again when the 
world is recreated. But the eternity of the Veda and apaurus- 
eyatva of the Veda were interpreted in various ways e. g. the 
Mahabhasya says that, though the purport of the Veda is eternal , 
yet the arrangement of words is non-eternal and therefore 
there are various sakhas ( branches or recensions ) of the Veda, 
named Kathaka, Kalapaka &c. 858 

From very ancient times the literature to be studied appears 
to have been vast. Vide Tai. Br, quoted above ( at p. 271 ) where 
the Vedas have been declared to be endless. In the Rgveda ifcself 
( X. 71. 11 ) reference is made to the verses learnt by the four 
principal priests ( hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma ), it is 
also said that parsons who studied together showed great 
disparity in their mental advancement ( Kg. X. 71. 7 ) and that 
co-students feel elation when their friend wins in a debate in 
an assembly. The Sat. Br. ( XL 5. 7. 4-8, S. B. E. vol. 44, 
pp. 97-98 ) enumerates under * svadhyaya ' rks, yajus formulae, 
samans, Atharvangirasah (Atharvaveda ), itihasa-purana, gathas 
in praise of heroes ( called Narasamsls ) \ The Gopatha Bra- 
hmana II. 10 also says ' in this way all these Vedas were 
created together with kalpa, rahasya ( secret doctrines ),

BrShraanas, Upanisads, itihfisa, anvikhyfina, purftna, anuft*- 
ganas, vakovakya &o \ In the Upanisads frequent mention is 
made of the literature studied by persons before they became 
seekers for the knowledge of brahma. For example, in 
Chan. Up. VII. 1. 2 NSrada tells Sanatkumara that he had 
studied the four Vedas, ItihSsa-purana as the fifth Veda, the 
Veda of Vedas ( grammar ), pitrya ( treatise on sr&ddhas ), rÂ§ii 
( arithmetic ), daiva ( portents ), nidhi ( finding out hidden 
treasures ), vakovakya ( dialogue or dialectic ), ekayana 
( politics ), devavidya ( Nirukta ), brahmavidya ( metres and 
phonetics ), bhutavidya ( exorcising ghosts ), ksatravidya 
( dhanurveda ), naksatravidya ( astronomy ), sarpavidya ( snake 
charms ), devajanavidya ( arts like dancing, singing, preparing 
unguents &c. ). The same list is repeated in Chan. Up. VII. 
1.4 and VII. 7. 1. In the Br. Up. 859 II. 4. 10 and IV. 5. 11 
there is a similar smaller list. In the Mundaka Up. I. 1. 5 
it is said that the aoarya Angiras told Saunaka who was 
a great householder that the four Vedas and the six angas 
( mentioned in note 775 above ) are inferior knowledge and that 
the highest knowledge is that by which the Imperishable One is 
apprehended. Gaut. XI. 19 exhorts the king to rely upon 
the Veda, dharraasastras, the angas, Upavedas and Purana for 
regulating the conduct of his subjects. Ap. Dh. S. ( quoted 
above in note 775), Visnu Dh. S. 30. 34-38, Vas.HI. 19 and 23, VI. 
8-4 mention the angas of Veda. Panini shows acquaintance not 
only with the Veda and Brahmanas but he knew ancient 
Kalpasutras, Bhiksusutras and Natasutras, secular works on 
various subjects ( IV. 3. 87-88, 105, lio,lll, 116 ). Patanjali 160 
( 2nd century B. C. ) mentions how vast the field of Sanskrit 
literature had become. Yaj- I. 44-45 calls upon the student to 
study every day according to his ability also Vakovakya,

please the gods and manes. Fourteen vidy&s are generally 
enumerated as in Yaj. I. 3 ( = Matsya 53. 5-6 ), Vayupurana 
vol. 1. 61. 78, Vrddha-Gautama (p. 632) and other works, viz. four 
vedas, 6 augas, purapas, nyaya ( logic ), mlmamsa and dlrar- 
masastra. Some added four more to these, viz. the Upavedas of 
Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Arthasastra (which 
were affiliated respectively to the four Yedas) and thus the vidyas 
are also spoken of as 18. 862 Kalidasa in the Raghuvamsa (V. 21) 
expressly says that Varatamtu taught his pupil 14 vidyas. In 
E.I. vol. VIII. p. 287 ( in an inscription of 199 Guptasamvat i.e. 
517-18 A. D.) it is said about Susarman, an ancestor of Maharaja 
Samksobha, that ' he knew the highest truth because of his 
proficiency in the 14 vidya-sthanas \ Kurnarila 863 in his 
Tantravartika ( p. 201 ) says that vidya-sthanas that are looked 
upon as authoritative in knowing dharma are 14 or 18. The 
Varahagrhya ( 6 ) refers to different preparations for different 
people, viz. a yajfiika had to study mantra and Brahmana, 
kalpa ( vedic ritual ) and mlmamsa and one could study at his 
option grammar, the smrtis and vaktra(?) and the srotriya 
only committed to memory the Veda ; the first two were called 
snatakas. Numerous grants and inscriptions testify to the 
provision made by kings and well-to-do donors for all branches 
of study. In E. C. vol. III. T N. 27 there is a grant made by the 
minister Perumal under the Hoysala king Viranarasirhhadeva 
in 1290 A. D. which provided that each teacher of the Rgveda 
and the other Vedas was to receive a salary of six gadyanakas 
of gold a year and the teacher who taught the boys to read 
Nagara, Kannada, Tigula ( Tamil ) and Arya ( Marathi ) was to 
receive the same salary. The Gadag inscription of the time of 
Vikramaditya VI. (1098 A. D.) refers to the founding of a school 
for teaching Prabhakara's system of Mlmamsa at Lakkigundi 
( E. I. vol. 15 p. 348 ). Vide E. L vol. I. p. 338 ( for endow- 
ment for teaching an astronomical work of Bhaskara). 

Even in early times a very extensive literature on 
Dharma- sastra had come into existence. The literature of 
the epics, of kavyas, drama, fables and romances, astrology, 
medicine and several branches of speculation had grown to an

enormous extent. On account of this vast literature many 
portions of which appealed more to the emotions and intellect 
than the Vedas could, the study of the Veda receded in the 
background and the study of subsidiary works became more 
popular. Therefore the smrtis again and again raise their voice 
and try to impress it upon all that the first duty of a dvijati is to 
study the Veda. The Maitrl Up. VII. 10, though comparatively 
a late work, inveighs against brahmanas studying non-vedic 
texts. 86 * Manu (II. 168 ) says that the dvija who, without study- 
ing the Veda, bestows labour upon another lore, is quickly 
reduced to the status of a sudra in this very life together with 
his descendants. KullGka on this verse cites the aphorism of 
Sankha-Likhita 865 ' one should not, without studying the Veda 
first, study another lore, except the Vedangas and smrtis \ Vas. 
Dh.S. III. 2 expressly quotes the verse of Manu II. 168 as Manava 
sloka. The Tai. Up. I. 9 speaks of svadhy ay a (study of the Veda) 
and pravacana (teaching it or daily repeating it) as tapas and 
joins these two with rta, satya, tapas, 866 dama, sama, fires, 
agnihotra and progeny in order to emphasize that these two are 
the most important and it also exhorts the student on the eve of 
his return home not to neglect his study of the Veda. 

The study of the Veda did not merely consist in learning 
the mantras by heart. Sarhkara in his bhasya on Vedantasutra 
I. 3. 30 quotes a Brahmana text to the effect that he who teaches 
a mantra or officiates at a sacrifice with mantras of which he 
does not know the seer, the deity or the Brahmana (i. e. viniyoga, 
employment or use) falls on a stump or in a pit. 86? The Mit. on 
Yaj. III. 300 quotes a verse of Vyasa to the same effect. Not 
only was the Veda to be committed to memory ( i. e. not 
only was there to be patha ) but one had also to understand

the meaning. The Nirukta (I. 18) quotes two verses 861 
which condemn in very strong language one who only commits 
to memory the Veda and does not know the meaning ' that man, 
who having studied the Veda, does not know its meaning, is 
indeed a tree, a stump, a mere carrier of a load ; he alone who 
knows the meaning secures all happiness ; his sins being 
shaken off by knowledge, he reaches heaven \ Daksa 869 II. 34 
says that the study of Veda involves five things viz. first 
committing to memory the Veda, then reflection over its 
meaning, keeping it fresh by repeating it again and again, japa 
(inaudibly muttering by way of prayer) and imparting it to 
pupils. Manu XIL 103 says 'those who have committed to 
memory the Veda are superior to those who are ignorant of it, 
those who retain their Veda ( i. e. who do not allow it to be 
forgotten ) are superior to those who only studied it ( and then 
forgot it ), those who know its meaning are superior to those 
who simply retain it in memory, those who perform what the 
meaning of the Veda dictates are superior to those who know 
its meaning \ Sahara 87n says that the real purpose of the study 
of the Veda is the knowledge about religious actions that it 
conveys and that from the mere memorizing of the Veda, no 
rewards are promised by those who know the lore of the 
sacrifices. Vi^varQpa 87! on Yaj. I. 51 says that he alone is 
really vedaparaga who has made the Veda his own as to the 
spirit ( the meaning ). Apararka ( p. 74 ) quotes a long passage 
from Vyasa condemning the mere memorizing of the Veda. 878

358 History of Dharmaiastrd [ Oh. VII 

In spite of these excellent precepts it appears that front 
very ancient times the Veda was only committed to memory and 
most men learned in the Veda never cared to know its meaning. 
The Mahabharata 87J speaks disparagingly of the srotriya as 
having an intelleot dulled by the constant repetition of the 
anuv&kas of the Veda. Further there was always an under- 
current of the belief that the mere memorizing of the Vedic texts 
conferred great sanctity on the memorizer and removed all 
sins. As time went on these ideas became supreme and the 
neglect of the meaning of the Veda has gone so far that among 
many modern orthodox brahmanas there is a belief that the 
meaning of the Veda cannot be known and it is futile to try to 
find its meaning. The Tai. Br. says that a man's sins are 
destroyed by the Veda and by svadhyaya. In Vas. Dh. S. 27. 1, 
Manu XL 245, Yaj. III. 310 and in numerous other places it is 
said that sins do not affect a man who studies the Veda and that 
the study of Veda destroys sin. Vas. Db. S. 28. 10-15 speaks of 
about 35 groups of Vedic hymns ( like the Aghamarsana, ftg. 
X. 190 ) by silently muttering which a man is purified of his 
sins; but Vas. Dh. S. 27. 4 is careful to add that Veda study 
only removes such sins as are committed through ignorance or 
carelessness. 874 Similar provision for removal of sins by the 
muttering of the Vedic mantras is made in Visnu Dh. S. 56. 
1-27, Yaj. III. 307-309, Manu XI. 248-260 &c. 

Not only was the Veda to be committed to memory, but 
when learnt it was not allowed to slip from one's mind. 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 7. 21. 8 makes % brahmojjha y (i. e. abandoning what 
is learnt) a grave sin along with drinking wine and others. 
Similarly Manu XL 56 and Yaj. III. 228 also treat it as equal 
to drinking wine or the murder of a brahmana. 

Similarly Manu IV. 163 forbids nastikya 87 ' (holding that there 
is no soul or no Hereafter ) and the reviling of the Veda and In

Oh. VII ] Reviling the Veda 35$ 

XL 56 regards the latter as a grave sin equal to drinking wine, 
while Yaj. III. 288 treats it as grave as brahmahatyfi. Gaut. 21. 
1 mentions the nastika among patitas along with brahmana 
murderer and drinker of wine. Visnu Dh. S. 37. 4 includes the 
reviling of Veda among upapatakas ( lesser sins ). Manu II. 11 
says that he who disrespects veda and smrfci by relying on 
syllogistic reasoning is a reviler of Veda and a nastika (atheist) 
and should be excluded from social intercourse by good men. 
Vas. Dh. S. XII. 41 says ' to hold the vedas as unauthoritative, 
to carp at the words of the sages, and to be wavering on all 
points lead to one's destruction \ Vide Visnu Dh. S. 71. 83 and 
Anu&asanaparva 37. 11 for the same ( in the latter the 2nd pada 
is 6astranam cabhilanghanam ) # 

Another striking feature of the ancient educational system 
was the total absence of any prior agreement about fees foi 
teaching students. So early as Br. Up. IV. 1. 2 we find Yajnavalkyt

saying to king Janaka who offered to give him a thousand cows, 
an elephant and a bull ( or as Samkara explains an elephant- 
like bull ), * my father waB of opinion that without fully 
teaching a pupil one should not receive any reward from 
him \ 8T8 Gaufc. 877 ( II. 54-55 ) says that at the end of his studies 
the student should request the teacher to accept the wealth that 
he could offer or ask the teacher what should be given and after 
paying or doing what the teacher wants or if the teacher 
allowed him to go without demanding anything, the student 
should take the ceremonial bath ( i. e. return home ). The As v. 
gr. ( III. 9. 4 ) has almost the same words. The Ap. Dh. S. 878 
( 1. 2. 7. 19-23 ) requires the student to offer at the end of his 
studies, whatever their extent may be, a daksina obtained from 
proper sources to his teacher according to his abilities and that 
if the teacher is in straightened circumstances, to offer him a fee 
even by begging from a person who is of the ugra caste or from 
a siudra and that after offering a fee or doing even a very 
strikingly good turn [to his teacher he should not boast of it 
to others nor should he ever dwell in his mind over it. The 
ideal was that the daksina ( fee ) offered to the teacher at the 
end of study was simply for pleasing or propitiating the teacher 
and was not a complete equivalent of or compensation for the 
knowledge imparted. Manu ( II. 245-246 ) says that the student 
need not give anything to the teacher till his snana ; when he is 
about to return home, he may offer to his guru some wealth; that 
the gift of a field, gold, a cow, or a horse, of even shoes or an 
umbrella, of a seat, corn, vegetables and clothes (either singly or 
together) may engender pleasure in the teacher. The Chan. Up. 871 
III. 11. 6 eulogises brahmavidya by declaring it to be more valua- 
ble than the gift of the whole earth together with all its wealth.

letter to the pupil, there is nothing in this world by giving 
which the pupil can get rid of the debt he owes. The Maha- 
bharata says ( A&vamedhika 56. 21 ) that the teacher's satisfac- 
tion with the student's work and conduct is indeed the proper 
daksina. 881 Yaj. I. 51 says that one should give to his teacher 
what he chooses to ask as daksina and Katyayana 888 quoted by 
Apararka ( p. 76 ) prescribes that a brahmana pupil may give a 
cow, a princely one a village, a vai&ya a horse (if able to do so). 
It has been shown above ( p. 355 ) how kings and others made 
gifts of lands or provided for salaries to teachers. One of the 
earliest record about university scholarships is contained in the 
Bahur ( near Pondichery ) plates of Nrpatungavarman in which 
we find a grant to a Vidyasthana ( a seat of learning ) for 
promotion of learning ( E. I. vol. 18 p. 5 ). In E. I. vol. 15 p. 83 
there is provision of 30 maitars of land for professors lecturing 
to ascetics and of eight mattars to teachers giving lessons to the 
youths in a monastery ( in the times of Caiukya Somes vara I 
at Sudi in Dharwar District in kake 981 ). The Peshwa distri- 
buted to learned brahmanas every year daksina which rose to 4 
lakhs of rupees a short time before 1818 A. D. It may be stated 
that even in the 20th century there are numerous, brahmana 
teachers of the veda and the fcastras who. teach pupils for 
years without -stipulating for any fee or even receiving any- 
thing from them. 

According to Manu II. 141, Sankhasmrti III. 2 and Visnu 
Dh. S. 29. 2 a teacher who teaches the Veda or the Vedangas for 
money or for his livelihood is called an Upadhyaya. Yaj. III. 
235 and Visnu Dh. S. 37. 20 and others include teaching for 
money ( and also learning from a paid teacher ) among upapata- 
kas ( lesser sins ). Manu III. 156, Anutesana 23. 17 and Yaj. I. 
223 say that he who is a hired teacher ( bhrtakadhyapaka ) and 
he who learns from such a teacher are not fit to be invited at a 
fcraddha. ButMedhatithi(on Manu II. 112 and III. 146), the Mit. 
( on Yaj. III. 235 ), the Sm. C. and others say that a person does 
not become a hired teacher by accepting something from a 
pupil, but that what is condemned is making a stipulation before- 
hand that one would teach only if a certain sum or if so much

wÂ«re paid or delivered. 883 In distress, Manu X. 116 and Y&j. 
III. 42 allow even such stipulations for the purpose of securing 
one's livelihood. 

The Mahabharata ( Adi. 133. 2-3 ) shows that when Bhlsma 
appointed Drona as the teaoher of the Pandava and Kaurava 
princes he bestowed on him wealth and a well-furnished house 
full of corn ; but there was no stipulation. 

It has been shown above (p. 113) that it was the king's duty 
to support learned men and students and to see that no brahmana 
died of hunger in his kingdom ( vide Gaut. X. 9-1 2, Visnu 
Dh. a III, 79-80, Manu VII. 82-85, Y&j. I. 315, 333 ). So a 
student, when the teacher demanded a heavy fee at the end of 
studies, could theoretically at least approach a king for the fee. 
Kalidasa draws in Raghuvamsa V a graphic picture how Vara- 
tantu demanded a daksina of 14 crores from his pupil Kautsa 
who approached Raghu for the same and would not take more 
than his requirements. Sometimes the teacher or his wife, 
according to legends, demanded fanciful dak^inas. For example, 
Utfcanka was asked by his teacher's wife, when he urged her to 
take something, to bring the ear-rings of the queen of the reigning 
king ( vide Adiparva chap. 3 and ASvamedhika-parve 56 ). 

It would be interesting to see how far corporal punishment 
of pupils was allowed in ancient India. Gaut. 884 ( II. 48-50 ) 
lays down that pupils are to be regulated ( ordinarily ) without 
boating ; but if it is not possible to control the pupil ( by words 
&c ) then he may be struck with a slender rope or with a split 
bamboo ; that if the teacher struck (the pupil ) in any other way 
( e. g. with the hand &c- ) the teacher should be punished by the 
king. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 8. 29-30 calls upon the teacher to 
censure ( by words ) a pupil when he commits a fault and to 
employ according to the gravity of the offence any one or more 
of the following punishments till the pupil desists, viz. threatening 
( the pupil ), refusing to give him food, drenching him in cold 
water and not allowing him to come in his presence. 885 The

Ch. VII ] Corporal punishment of students 363 

Mahabhasya 88 ' (vol. I. p. 41) refers to the fact that when a pupil 
pronounced a wrong accent ( e. g. anudatta in place of udatta ) 
the up&dhySya slapped him ( on the back probably ). Manu 
VIII. 299-300, Visnu Dh. S. 71. 81-82, Narada ( abhyupetyS- 
6uÂ§rus5, verses 13-14) follow Gautama as to corporal punishment, 
but add that beating should be on the back only and never on 
the head nor on the chest, while Narada further rules that the 
beating should not be excessive. Manu ( VIII. 300 ) says that 
the punishment in case of violation of these rules by the 
teacher is that for a thief and ( VIII. 299 ) extends the same 
rules to the son and the wife. Manu II. 159 recommends that 
in imparting instruction about the right path of conduct, one 
should use sweet persuasive ( not high-toned ) words. 

A few words must now be said about the education of 
kaatriyas, vateyas and Sudras. According to Gaut. XI. 3 a king 
should be well-grounded in the three Vedas and in Anvlksikl 
(i. e. metaphysics) and in XL 19 Gaut. says that the king has to 
rely for carrying out his duties on the veda, the dharmaSastras, 
the subsidiary lores of the veda, the upavedas and puranas. 
Manu VII. 43 and Yaj. I. 311 say that a king should be profi- 
cient in the three Vedas, in metaphysics, in dandanlti ( the 
art of government and statecraft ) and in varta ( economic life- 
and production of wealth). These directions were probably 
meant to be an ideal and very few kings ever went through all 
this. If any conclusions are to be drawn from the stories in the 
Mahabharata, we may say that princes at least hardly ever went 
to a guru's home, but teachers were engaged to teach them ( as 
Drona was engaged by Bhlsma ) and they became proficient in ; 
military skill. Alberuni(tr.by Sachaul888,vol.Ip,125)says that 
brahmanas taught the veda to kaatriyas, but he is probably 
drawing only on the rules given in the smrtis. Kings left 
ecclesiastical matters to their purohita and were always to rely 
on him for advice. Gaut. 887 XL 12-13 and Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 
16 require that the purohita was to be a learned man of good 
birth, endowed with polished speech, a fine form, middle age 
and high character and that he was to be well- versed in dharma 
and artha. A6v. gr. III. 12 describes how the purohita is to 
prepare the king for battle. Kaut. in his Artha&astra after

stating several views gives his own opinion that the vidyas for 
a prince are four ( the same as those of Manu and Y&j. above ), 
that after the caula is performed the prince should learn the 
alphabet and arithmetic and when upanayana is performed he 
should learn the four vidyas till he is 16 years old and may 
then marry (I. 5), that in the first part of the day he should have 
instruction in elephant riding and horse riding,riding in chariots 
and in arms and the latter part of the day he should devote to 
hearing puranas, stories, dharmasastra and arthasastra (politics). 
In the Hathigumpha Inscription ( 2nd century B. C. ) there is 
a reference to rupa ( currency ), gartana ( finance and treasury 
accounts ), lekha ( official correspondence ) and vyavdhara ( law 
and judicial administration ) as the subjects whioh Kharavela 
mastered as heir-apparent from his 15th year to his 24th ( vide 
E.I. vol.20 p. 71 at p. 81, J. R. A. S. 1918 p. 545, I. H. Q. vol. 14 
for 1938 p. 459 ff. ). In the Kadambarl also B&na shows that 
prince Candraplda did not go to a teacher's house but that a 
school was built for him outside the capital where he learnt 
from his 7th to the 16th year. 

As to the education of ksatriyas in general we have hardly 
any directions in the dharmasastra works. But that there were 
several learned ksatriyas and vaisyas who sometimes became 
teachers cannot be denied. Kumar ilabhat^a says ( on Jaimini 
I. 2. 2) that adhyapana 888 is not a special characteristic for 
recognising that a man is a brahmana, since certain ksatriyas 
and vaisyas who have given up the observation of the caste 
rules also do so. 

About the education of vaisyas there is still less material. 
Manu X. 1 lays down generally that the three varnas ( includ- 
ing vaisyas ) are to learn the Veda, ( X. 79 ) that trade, cattle- 
rearing and agriculture are the means of the vaisya's livelihood 
and that (IX. 328-332) the vaisya should never think of giving up 
cattle rearing, that he should know the prices of jewels, coral 
and pearls, of metals and clothes, of perfumes and salt, the 
sowing of seed, the qualities and defects of soils, measures and 
weights, the different grades of qualities of goods, the profit 
and loss in trade, the rates of pay for servants, various alpha- 
bets and the places where saleable articles are produced or 
manufactured. 






Ch. VII ] Education of vaisyas and iudras 365 

Yaj. II. 184, Narada ( abhyupetyasusrusa 16-20 ) indicate that 
boys were apprenticed with master artisans to learn several 
iilpas (crafts) like preparing ornaments 889 of gold or for learning 
dancing, singing &o. An apprentice was to stipulate how 
long he would stay with the master craftsman, that even if 
he learnt the craft earlier than the stipulated time he was still 
to stay with the teacher and work for him till the period was 
over, that the teacher was to give food and lodging to the 
apprentice and to appropriate the proceeds from his work, that 
if the apprentice left the teacher before the time fixed even 
though the teacher was ready to teach him, he was to be 
compelled to stay with the teacher and to be imprisoned or 
sentenced to whipping by the king if he would not stay. 

As for the education of the sudra, there are hardly any rules 
in the dharmasSstras. He gradually, as stated above ( at 
pp. 120-121), rose in status and was allowed to engage in crafts' 
and agriculture and so the same rules might have been applied* 
to him as to vaisya apprentices. The sudra could listen to 
the recitation of the Mahabharata and the puranas as shown 
above ( at pp. 155-156 ). 

It appears that in very ancient times the status of Indian 
women as to education was much higher than in medieval and 
modern times in India. Several women are stated to have been 
the composers of Vedic hymns ; e. g. Rg. V. 28 is ascribed to 
Visvavara of the Atri family ; Rg. VIII. 91 to Apala of the 
same family and Rg. X 39 to Ghosa Kakslvatl. The Br. Up. 
II. 4. 1. shows that Maitreyl, one of the two wives of Yajna- 
valkya, the great philosopher of ancient India, was herself a 
very earnest seeker after true knowledge and she prayed to 
Yajnavalkya that he should impart to her such knowledge as 
would make her immortal. 890 In the same Upanisad (III. 6 and 8) 
we find that among the several interlocutors in the court of 
Janaka, king of Videha, who propounded several questions for 
solution before Yajnavalkya, GargI Vacaknavl occupies a very 
prominent position. She pursued Yajfiavalkya with subtle and 
searching questions till ultimately he was forced to warn her

not to probe too much into the nature of the First Principle 
which was beyond mere human reason and logical questioning 
or otherwise she might die by the fall of her head. Then she 
desisted, but her unquenchable thirst for philosophical 
knowledge again swelled up and she put two questions to 
Yajnavalkya hoping to confound him. In the same Up. ( Br. 
Up. VI. 4. 17 ) there is a rite prescribed 891 for one who desires 
to have a learned daughter. As in the very preceding sentence 
a prescription is given for one desirous of having a son who 
would master the three Vedas, it naturally follows that the 
learning of the daughter must refer to the same topic. But 
Sarhkara, in whose day women were debarred from learning the 
Vedas, could not but explain the word * panditft' as referring to 
proficiency in domestic work. It has been shown above (p. 294) 
that upanayana and veda study were allowed to women by 
Harlta. In the daily rsitarpana ( Asv. gr. III. 4 ) among a host 
of sages water is offered to three women as teachers viz. GargI 
Vacaknavl, Vadava Pratitheyl and Sulabha Maitreyl. The very 
fact that the Kasika on Panini IV. 1. 59 and III. 3. 21 teaches 
the formation of 5cary& and upadhySya as meaning a woman 
who is herself a teacher ( and not merely the wife of a teacher ) 
establishes that the ancient grammarians were familiar with 
women teachers. Patanjali teaches 8 * 8 how and why a 
brahmana woman is called ApisalU ( one who studies the gram- 
mar of Apisali ) and Kasakrtsna ( one who studies the mlmSrhsS 
work of Kasakrtsna). He also states the formation of the 
appellation ' Audameghah ' ( meaning the pupils of a woman 
teacher called Audameghya). Gobhila 89S gr. II. 1. 19-20 prescri- 
bes that when the bride pushes forward with her foot a mat the 
bridegroom should make her repeat the mantra * may the way 
which my husband goes by be also assigned to me ' and that if 
she does not repeat this mantra ( through bashfulness &c. ) he

should repeat it substituting the words ' to her * f or ' to me \ 
In the Kanaka 894 gr. 25. 23 it is said that the Anuvaka 
beginning with 'sarasvati predam-ava * ( of 21 verses) was to be 
reoited both by the bride and the bridegroom according to some 
teachers. All this shows that women could recite Vedic 
mantras in the sutra period. The Kamasutra of Vatsy ay ana, 895 a 
remarkable though in some places a filthy work, prescribes that 
women should study the Kamasutra and its subsidiary angas 
(viz, the 64 kalas such as singing, dancing, painting &c. ) before 
they attain youth ( i. e. in their father's house) and after marriage 
with the husband's consent. In the 64 kalas enumerated in 
that work ( I. 3. 16 ) are included prahelikas ( riddles of words ), 
pustakavficana ( chanting from books ), kavyasamasya-purana 
( composing a suitable portion of a verse to fit in with a portion 
given ), knowledge of lexicons and metres &c. Wo read in the 
epics and the dramas like the Sakuntala of women writing 
messages to their lovers. In the Malatlm&dhava Bhavabhuti 
tells his readers that the fathers of the hero and the heroine 
studied in their youth together with KaraandakI at the feet 
of the same master. From anthologies like Rajasekhara's 
Saktimuktftvali we learn that there were poetesses like Vijjft, Slta 
&c. All these facts tend to indicate that literary attainments 
among women were not totally unheard of in ancient India. 

But gradually the position of women became worse and 
worse. In the Dharmasutras and Manu woman is assigned a 
position of dependence and even women of higher classes came 
to be looked upon as equal to sudras so far as Vedic study and 
several other matters were concerned. Gaut. 18. 1, Vas. Dh. S. 
VI. 1> Baud. Dh. S. II. 2, 45 and Manu IX. 3 say that women have 
no independence and in all stages depend upon men. We have 
seen (at p. 265) also that all the samskaras (except marriage) were 
performed in the case of girls without Vedic mantras. Though 
according to the Purvamlmamsa the husband and wife were to 
perform Vedic sacrifices together (Jaimini VI. 1.17-21) still 
women 898 were only associated with their husbands and all the

actions to be done by the sacrifioer ( yajam&na ) were to be done 
only by the kusband except where the texts expressly requested 
the wife to do certain things such as examining the ajya or repeat- 
ing certain mantras (VI. 1. 24). Jaimini says that the husband 
and wife were not equal and Sahara explains that the yajamana 
is a male and is learned, while the patnl is a woman and has 
no vidyS. Medhatithi 897 on Manu II. 49 raises the interesting 
question why brahmacarins when begging for alms used a 
Sanskrit formula (bhavati bhiksam dehi) which language ladies 
do not know. He replies that women can understand that 
vernacular words which they use being similar to Sanskrit 
words must be derived from them and that these few well- 
known Sanskrit words they can easily grasp. Besides even in 
Vedic times there was a tendency as in many other countries to 
make sarcastic references to women. The Rgveda 898 VIII. 33. 17 
says " Even Indra said ' the mind of woman cannot be control- 
led ; and also her intellect ( or power ) is slight ' M ; in Rg. 
X. 95. 15 *" 'there is no truth in the friendship of women ; they 
have the hearts of hyaenas \ The Sat. Br. XIV. 1. 1. 3 exhorts 
a person studying the Madhu-vidya not to look at 'woman, 
6udra, the dog and the black bird that are all untruth \ In 
Manu IL 213-214, Anusasanaparva chap. 19. 91-94, chap. 38 
and 39 there is severe condemnation of woman. Such ideas, and 
ideas about pollution and the early marriage of girls are 
probably responsible for the great lack of literacy among 
women in medieval and modern times. 

As literary education among women was in a languishing 
state or almost nil, the question of co-education hardly arises. 
There are no doubt faint indications that when women could 
at all devote themselves to learning, they must have been taught 
with male pupils. Poets like Bhavabhuti (in the Malatl- 
madhava ) envisage a state of society in which a woman ( like 
Kamandakl ) learnt at the feet of the same master along with 
male students (like Bhurivasu and Devarata, who later on 
became ministers of states ).

Cb. VII ] Education in ancient India 

The house of the aoarya where the student learnt was called 
ficfiryakula (vide Chan. Up. II. 23. 2, IV. 5. 1., IV. 9. 1, VIII. 15. 
1). The teacher who presided over a large establishment of 
pupils was called kulapati ( e. g. Kanva is so referred to in 
the Sakuntala, vide note 134 above ). 

It is outside the scope of this work to show from the 
numerous inscriptions and copper-plate grants that have been 
published so far, how ancient kings and rich private persons 
made substantial grants to famous schools, colleges and univer- 
sities. There were famous universities at Taksasila ( modern 
Taxila ), Valabhi, Benares, Nalands, Vikramasila &c. For an 
account of the university of Nalanda in the 7th century 
reference may be made to the accounts given by the two Chinese 
travellers Yuan Chwang ( vide Watters vol. II. pp. 109, 246 ) 
and Itsing ('Records of the Buddhist Religion' by Dr. Takakusu 
pp. 154, 177 &c). Most of those seats of learning were endowed. 
One of the earliest of such grants is that of the Pallava 
Nrpatunga-varman ( Bahur Plates, E. 1. 18 p. 5 ) whereby three 
villages were bestowed as a source of revenue ( vidySbhoga ) 
for the promotion of learning to the residents of a seat of 
learning ( vidyasthana, a college ) at Vagur. The KSvya- 
mlmamsS of Rajasekhara ( in chap. 10 ) calls upon the king to 
hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to arrange for their 
examination and to distribute rewards to them in the manner 
of such ancient kings as Vasudeva, Satavahana, Sudraka, 
Sahasanka. It also says that in UjjayinI such poets as Kalidasa, 
Mentha, Bharavi, Haricandra were examined and in Pataliputra 
( modern Patna ) such famous sastrakaras as Panini, Vyadi* 
Vararuci, Patanjali, Varsa, Upavarsa, and Pingala were 
examined. 

The salient features of the educational system outlined in 
the Dharma^astra works are the high and honourable position 
assigned to the teacher, the close personal contact of the pupil 
with the teacher and individual attention, the pupil's stay with 
the teacher as a member of his family, oral instruction and the 
absence of books, stern discipline and control of emotions and 
the will, cheapness ( as no fees were stipulated for ). The 
Indian system compares most favourably with any system of 
education of the West, whether in Greece or Rome or any other 
country. It gave to the students a more or less literary educa- 
tion, particularly of the Vedic literature and of philosophy, 
grammar and other subjects ancillary thereto, The principal 
h. d. 47 



370 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. VII 

effort was directed towards the conservation of the ancient 
literature rather than to the creation of fresh literature. In 
these respects it was similar to the Grammar Schools of 
England and to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge as 
they were till about the middle of the 19th century. The defects 
of the Indian system were that it was too literary, there was 
too much memorizing, boys under it had hardly any instruction 
in useful manual arts and crafts, the studies were not brought in 
contact with practical life. The discipline was rigorous and 
joyless. Many of these defects were due to the exigencies of the 
caste system which assigned particular avocations to particular 
castes. We cannot and should not compare the system with 
the systems of education prevalent in the 20th century, when 
several subjects such as literature, music and the fine arts, 
handicrafts, mathematics, science, history and geography are 
taught in the schools to all boys and when it has been recog- 
nised that education is a prime concern of the State. 

The four Veda-vratas: â Among the samskaras enumerated 
by Gautama there are four Veda-vratas ( Gaut. VIII. 15 ). 
These four are also included in the 16 sarhskaras by several 
smrtis. Their names and procedure differ considerably in the 
several grhyasiitras. Some grhyasutras like Par. do not 
describe them. A brief reference will be made to them here. The 
Asv. gr. I. 22. 20 900 says in general words that in the vratas 
all the ceremonies beginning from shaving the head up to 
paridana ( i. e. Asv. gr. L 19. 8 to I. 20. 7 ) that are performed at 
the upanayana are repeated each time with each vrata. And the 
four vratas according to the Asvalayana srarti ( in verse ) were 
MahanamnI vrata, Mahavrata ( Ait. Ar. I. and V ), Upanisad 
vrata and Godana. Each vrata is to be performed for a year. 
Vide Laghu Asvalayana 11th section ( Anan. Ed ). The San. 
gr. ( II. 11-12 ) describes, after the student is instructed in the 
sacred Gayatrl, four vratas ( observances ) called Sukriya 
( which precedes the study of the main part of the Rgveda ), 
the Sakvara, Vrfitika and Aupanisada vratas ( which three 
precede the study of the different sections of the Aitareya 
Aranyaka ). The observance of the first of these ( viz. Sukriya) 
lasted for three days or twelve days or one year or as long as 
the teacher liked and the observances of the other three were to 
be kept for one year each ( San. gr. II. 11. 10-12, S. B. E. vol. 29

Ch. VII] The Veda-vratas 371 

p. 77 ). At the beginning of each of these three vratas there is 
a separate upanayana, followed by a ceremony called Uddlk- 
sanika ( giving up the preparatory observances ) ana then the 
vrata is to be performed for one year. The Aranyaka is to be 
studied in the forest out of the village. Manu II. 174 prescribes 
that at the time of the beginning of each of these vratas the 
student had to put on a new deer skin, a new yajnopavlta and 
a new girdle. The Gobhila grhya III 1. 26-31 ( which is 
connected with the Samaveda) mentions the vratas as 
Godanika, Vratika, Aditya, Aupanisada, Jyestha-samika, each 
lasting for one year. Ifc adds that soma do not observe the 
Aditya-vrata. The godana vrata is connected by the Gobhillya 
with the samskara of godana ( to be described below ) and it 
prescribes certain observances for it such as removing all hair 
on the head, chin and lips ; avoiding false-hood, anger, sexual 
intercourse, perfumes, dancing and singing, collyrium, honey 
and meat ; not wearing shoes in the village. It also prescribes 
that wearing the girdle, begging for food, carrying a staff, 
daily bath, offering a fuel-stick, and clasping the teacher's feet 
in the morning are common to all vratas. The Godanika 
enabled the student to study the Purvarcika of the Samaveda 
( i. e. the collection of verses sacred to Aghi, Indra and Soma 
Pavamana ). The Vratika was introductory to the study of the 
Aranyaka ( excluding Sukriya sections ); the Aditya vrata to 
the study of the Sukriya sections ; the Aupanisada-vrata to the 
study of the Upanisad-brahmana ; the Jyes^ha-samika to the 
study of the Ajya-dohas. The Kb. gr. II. 5. 17 ff. speaks of the 
same vratas as Gobhila. Those who observe the Adityavrata 
wore one garment, did not allow anything to come between 
them and the sun ( except trees and the roofs of houses ) and did 
not descend into water more than knee-deep. The Sakvara 
vrata was kept for one year, or for three or six or nine. Those 
who observe this vrata study the Sakvarl or MahanatnnI verses. 
Vartika 901 on Panini V. 1. 94. (tadasya brahmacaryam) mentions 
the Mahanamnls and teaches the derivation of Mahanamnikam 
( as the period of brahraacarya devoted to the vrata of the 
Mahanamnls). There were certain peculiar observances for

this such as bathing thrice a day ( Gobhila III. 2. 7-46, Kh. 
gr. II. 5. 23 ff. ), wearing dark clothes, partaking of dark food, 
standing by day, sitting by night, not seeking shelter when 
it is raining, not crossing a river without bathing in it 
( the virtue of the Mahanamnls is centred in water ). After the 
student has kept his vow for one-third of the time prescribed^ 
the teacher is to sing to the student the first stotriya of the 
Mahanamnls 902 (viz. the three mantras, vida maghavan, 
abhistvam, evahi sakro ) and in the same way the two other 
stotriyas ( each consisting of three mantras ). They are to be 
sung to the student who has fasted, has closed his eyes, has 
dipped his hand in a brass vessel full of water in which all 
sorts of herbs are thrown and whose eyes are veiled with a 
new piece of cloth, the student is to keep silent and abstain 
from food for one day and night ( or three ), to stand in the 
forest till sunset ( and return to the village in the night ), 
should sacrifice with mahavyahrtis ; look at fire, clarified butter, 
the sun, a brahmana, a bull, food, water and curds; then salute 
the teacher, break his silence and give a fee to the teacher and 
offer a mess of cooked food to Indra and give a dinner to the 
teacher and all co-students. The same rules apply to the 
Jyesthasamika vrata ( introductory to the study of the three 
Ajyadohas 903 viz. ' murdhanam divah, tvam visve, nabhim 
yajnanam). The student who undergoes this has to observe 
certain rules throughout his life viz. he cannot marry or have 
sexual intercourse with a sudra woman, cannot eat bird's flesh, 
he should not restrict himself to one kind of corn or one country 
and should always wear two garments, should bathe in water 
drawn with a vessel and should not eat in an earthen pot or 
drink water from it. 

The Baud. gr. III. 2. 4 ff says that there are vratas of one year 
each which precede the study of certain brahmana texts ( of the 
Krsna Yajurveda); they are hotarah 904 , sukriyas, upanisadah, 

902. J?f|Â«nÂ«fTS are verses beginning with f^r *TWi; ft^T which

godanam and sammitam and it describes them in detail. For 
want of space all these are passed over. The SamskSra-kaustubha 
( pp. 571-580 ) gives in some detail the procedure of the Maha- 
namnl vrata, M aha vrata, Upanisadvrata and Godanavrata. It 
states that the Mahanamnlvrata is performed in the 13th year 
from birth and Godanavrata in the 16th. It appears, however, 
that these vratas gradually fell into desuetude and medieval 
writers often pass them over altogether or barely mention them 
and emphasize only the general observances of brahmacarins 
viz. celibacy, begging for food, avoiding honey, wine and 
singing &c. For example, the Smrfcyarthasara 905 ( p. 6 ) refers 
to Savitrivrata, then the vrata for Vedic study and then the 
Aranyaka vratas. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 52 ( vedam vratani va 
param nltva ) explains * vratam ' as simply the duties of the 
student already enumerated by Yaj. ( among which the specific 
vratas of MahanaranI &c. do not figure ). 

If the student failed in observing the specific vratas, he 
had to perform piayascitta by undergoing the prajapatya 
penance thrice or six times or twelve times. If the brahmacarl 
is guilty of failing in his daily duties of observing sauea and 
acamana, of the performance of samdhya prayer, of using 
darbha, of begging for food, of offering fuel stick to fire, of 
avoiding the touch of sudras and the like, of wearing the 
cloth ( for covering his private parts ), the loin thread, the yajiio- 
pavlta, the girdle and the staff and deerskin, of not sleeping by 
day, of not holding an umbrella over his head or of not wear- 
ing shoes, or not putting on garlands, of avoiding luxurious 
bath, sandal paste, collyrium, of not sporting in water, of 
avoiding gambling, and addiction to dancing, singing and 
music, of not engaging in conversation with heretics, he had 
to undergo the penance of three krcchras ( according to Baudha- 
yana ) and to perform a homa with the vyahrtis separately and 
together ( i. e. four oblations of clarified butter were to be 
offered). 908 If he was guilty of other more serious lapses he

had to undergo heavier penance. The most reprehensible act in 
a brahmacarin was to have sexual intercourse with a woman. 
The Tai. Ar. II. 18 speaks of the praya&citta for such a 
brahmacarin who is called avahlrnin. Gaut. 25. 1-2 quotes the 
Tai. Ar. " they (the sages ) m say * in how many ( deities ) the 
avakirnin enters ; ( the answer is ) he enters the Maruts with 
his breath, Indra with his strength, Brhaspati with his spiritual 
eminence and fire with the rest ( of his senses ) ' " and Gautama 
further provides that he should kindle fire at midnight on a new 
moon day and then offer two ajya oblations by way of penance 
with the two mantras * kamava- ' and * Kamavadrugdhosmi ' 
&c., place a fuel stick on fire, sprinkle water round the fire, 
offer the yajnavastu oblation ( for which see Gobhila gr. I. 8. 
26-29 ) and standing near the fire should worship fire thrice 
with the verse 4 sam ma siiicantu \ Baud. Dh. S. ( IV. 2. 10-13 ) 
contains the same rules. Jaimini 908 ( VI. 8. 22 ) prescribes that 
ordinary ( laukika ) fire is to be used for the pasu to be sacrific- 
ed ( viz. ass to Nirrti, which is symbolic of the stupid lapse the 
student is guilty of ) and Sahara quotes a Vedic passage that ' a 
brahmacarin who has become avaJtirvin should sacrifice an ass 
to Nirrti \ Ap. Dh. S. L 9. 26. 8, Vas. 23. 1-3, Manu XL 
118-121, Yaj. III. 280 contain similar provisions ( Vasistha 
allowing in the absence of an ass oblations of boiled rice with 
the mantras mentioned by Gautama ). Manu XL 122-123 and 
Visnu Dh. S. 28. 49-50 prescribe that the brahmacarl so guilty 
should for one year wear the skin of the ass, should beg for 
food at seven houses announcing to them his lapse, should 
take food only once, should bathe thrice and then only he 
becomes pure. Manu II. 187 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 28. 52) prescribes 
similar penance for a brahmacarl who without being ill gives 
up begging for food and offering fuel to fire continuously for 
seven days. Prayascitta is prescribed for loss of yajfiopa- 
vlta or its being torn, or its being polluted by impure things

Naisthika brahmacarin ( perpetual student ). â 
Brahraacarins were of two kinds, upakurvana ( the student 
who offered some return to the teacher, vide Manu II. 245, for 
the word upakurvlta ) and the naisthika 909 ( the student who 
remains so till his death ). These two names occur in Harlta 
Dh. S., Daksa I. 7 and in several smrtis. The word ' naisthika ' 
occurs in Visnu Dh. S. 28. 46, Yaj. I. 49, Veda-Vyasa I. 41. 
The idea of perpetual studenthood is very ancient. In the 
Chandogya 910 Up. II. 23. 1 we read that the third branch of 
dharma is the ( status of a ) student who stays with his teacher's 
family and who wears out his body to the end in the family of 
the teacher. Gaut. III. 4-8, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 29, Harlta Dh. 9n 
Sâ Vas. VII. 4-6, Manu II. 243, 244, 247-249, and Yaj. I. 49-50 
say that if the student likes he may stay with his teacher till 
life lasts and should serve his guru and in the rest of the time 
repeat the Veda ; that if the teacher be dead he may stay with 
and serve the teacher's son if he is worthy or the teacher's wife 
or he may worship the fire kindled by his deceased guru ; he 
should thus wear out his body ; he obtains the highest worlds 
of bliss and is not born again. He has to perform throughout 
his life the duties of offering fuel sticks, Veda study, begging for 
food, sleeping on the ground ( not on a cot ), and of self-restraint 
( Brhaspati quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 62 ).

dwarfs, ill-formed, congenitally blind, impotent, cripples and 
those suffering from incurable diseases should become perpetual 
students, as they are not entitled to perform the Vedic rites and 
are not entitled to inherit. We saw above that Kumarilabhatta 
accepted this view ( vide note 852a ). But this does not mean 
that the blind and other partially defective people could not 
marry at all. They could marry if they had sufficient wealth. 
For example, Dhrtarastra, though congenitally blind, married 
and had sons. Apararka ( p. 72 ), the Sm. C, the Madanapari- 
jata ( p. Ill ), the Par. M. ( I. 2. p. 51 ff ) and others say that 
perpetual student-hood is not restricted only to the blind and 
the cripple, but it may be resorted to by even able-bodied men 
at their choice ( vide Manu II. 243-44 ). 

Atri ( VIII. 16 ) says 913 that if a person undertakes to be a 
perpetual student, but falls from that ideal, there is no prayas- 
citta for that lapse. Some interpret this as applying to one who 
becomes a samnyasin and then gives up that mode of life ; 
while others like the Samskara-prakasa ( p. 564 ) interpret it as 
meaning that the prayascitta is double of what the upakurvSna 
would have to undergo. 

Patitasavitrika ( those for whom there has been no upana- 
yana and therefore no instruction in Gayatrl and who are 
therefore sinful and outside the pale of Aryan society ). The 
grhya and dharma sutras are agreed that the time for upana- 
yana has not passed till the 16th, 22nd and the 24th year in the 
case of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas respectively, but that 
after these years are past without upanayana taking place they 
become incompetent thereafter for learning the Savitrl ( the 
sacred Gayatrl verse ), Vide Asv. gr. I. 19, 5-7, Baud. gr t III. 
13. 5-6, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 1. 22, Vas. XL 71-75, Manu II. 38-39, 
Yaj. I. 37-38. Such persons are then called patitasavitrika or 
cavitrlpatita and also vratya ( Manu II. 39 and Yaj. I. 38 call 
them so ). These works 9H also declare that the consequences of 
this are that no upanayana is to be thereafter performed for them, 
they are not to be taught the Veda, nor is any one to officiate at

their sacrifices and there is to be no social intercourse with them 
(i. e. no marriage takes place with them). Ap. Dh. S. 
( 1. 1. 1. 24-27 ) prescribes that after the 16th or 24th year, 
the person should undergo the rules of student-hood two 
months just as those who meant to study the three Vedas 
and whose upanayana has been performed observe (viz. 
begging for food &c. ), then his upanayana should be per- 
formed, then for one year he should bathe (thrice if 
possible) every day and then he should be taught the Veda. 
This is a somewhat easy penance. But others prescribe heavier 
penalties. Vas. Dh. S. XL 76-79 and the Vaik. smarta II. 3 
prescribe that one who is patitasavitrlka should either perform 
the Uddalaka vrata or should take a bath along with the 
performer of an Asvamedha sacrifice or should perform the 
Vratyastoma sacrifice. Both Vasistha 915 and the Vaik. smarta 
explain that the Uddalaka vrata consists in subsisting on 
barley gruel for two months, for one month on milk, for half a 
month on.amiksa ( the whey that arises by pouring curds in 
hot milk ), for eight days on ghee, for six days on alms obtained 
without begging, for three days on water and in observing a 
total fast for one whole day. The Sm. C. ( I. p. 28 ) says that 
this vrata is so called because it was promulgated by Uddalaka. 
Manu XL 191 and Visnu Dh. S. 54. 26 prescribe a mild praysa- 
citta for patitasavitrikas , viz. three prajapatya 9,e penances ; 
while Yaj. I. 38, Baud. gr. III. 13. 7, Veda-Vyasa I. 21 and 
several others prescribe only the Vratyastoma for those who 
are patitasavitrikas. Visvarupa 917 (on Yaj. III. 262) tries to 
reconcile these contradictions by saying that the easy penance 
prescribed by Manu applies to a brShmana whose upanayana is 
not performed before the 16th year, but whose upanayana is 
sought to be performed before the 22nd year, while the Vratya- 
stoma is to be performed for him whose upanayana is not

performed for forty-eight years from the first prescribed period 
( viz. 8th year, 11th year or 12th ). The Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 
also tries to introduce vyavastha ( order ) in the contradictory 
dicta of the smrtis. According to Gaut. 21. 11, Yaj. III. 234 and 
others vratyata ( being paUtasavitrlka) is only an upapataka and 
Manu XI. 117 prescribes an ea3y penance for all upapatakas. 

Ap. Dh. S. 918 says ' if a person's father and grandfather 
also had not the upanayana performed for them, then they ( i.e. 
the three generations ) are called slayers of brahma ( holy 
prayers or lore ) ; people should have no intercourse with them, 
should not take their food nor should enter into marriage alli- 
ances with them ; but if they desire then penance should be 
administered to them \ It then prescribes that they have to 
perform the penance (observing rules of student-hood) one 
year for each generation ( that had not the upanayana perform- 
ed), then there is upanayana and then they have to bathe 
( thrice or once ) every day for a year with certain mantras viz. 
the seven PSvamanl verses beginning with *yad anti yacca 
dflrake' ( Kg. IX. 67. 21-27 ), with the Yajus pavitra ( Tai. S. I. 
2. 1. i=Rg. X. 17. 10), with the samapavltra and with the 
mantra called Angirasa ( Rg. IV. 40. 5 ) or one may pour water 
only with the vyahrtis 919 . After all this is done, one may be 
taught the Veda. Ap. Dh. S. goes further ( I. 1. 2. 5-10 ) and 
says ' if the generations 92 Â° beginning with the great-grand- 
father had not the upanayana performed on them, they are 
called the cemetery and that if there is desire they may 
observe the rules of student-hood for twelve years, then

upanayana may be performed and then the person so 
desirous of upanayana will have to bathe with the PavamanI 
and other verses ( as stated above), then instruction in the 
duties of the householder may be imparted to him ( i. e. to the 
4th); he cannot, however, be taught the Veda; but his son may 
have the sarhskara performed as in the case of one who is him- 
self patitasavitrika and then his son will be one like other 
aryas \ Haradatta m remarks that Ap. does not declare the 
prayascitta for him whose great-grandfather's father also was 
without upanayana, but that those who know the dharmasastra 
should find out a proper prayascitta even in such cases. It is 
clear that Ap. contemplates cases where for three generations 
there had been no upanayana and the fourth generation also 
had not the upanayana performed at the right time and desired 
to have it performed for him. Par. gives a brief rule * when 
three generations are patitasavitrilui, their offspring ( i. e. the 
fourth generation ) is excluded from the sacrament of 
upanayana and he cannot be taught the Veda.' 9Â£2 So Par. 
is more restrictive than Apastamba. 

There is a famous historical example of the application of 
these rules. Gagabhatta, a profound scholar of Benares, 
officiated at the coronation of Shivaji, the founder of the 
Maratha Empire, in 1674 and performed the upanayana of 
Shivaji before the coronation, when Shivaji was about 45 years 
old and had even two sons. Some eminent scholars like the 
late Mr. Justice Telang 928 have found fault with Gagabhatta

923. In ' Gleanings from Maratha Chronicles ' appended to the late

observes (p. 286 ) * they had also to straits a point, when as a prelimi- 
nary to the installation, the thread ceremony essential for a k^atriya 
was performed on Shivaji at a time when he was forty-six or fifty years 
old and had already had two sons, an irregularity which also was, we are 
told, expressly assented to by all the brahmanas and pandits. How 
the brShmanas and pandits worked their way to this decision, none of 
our authorities state'; and further on (p. 288) he casts undeserved 
aspersions ' taking the whole evidence together it looks like a case of a 
more or loss deliberate manipulation of facts and religious rites in aid 
of a foregone conclusion adopted for a purely political purpose*. 
Mr. Justice Telang writes rather like a judge than like a scholar or a

and the ofcher brahmanas of that time ; but these scholars are 
wrong and Gagabhatta had behind him weighty and ancient 
authorities like Ap., Paraskara, Visvarupa and Haradatta as 
shown above. 

The Vaik. sutra ( II. 37 ) adds that in the case of the man 
who is himself patitasavitrika the sariiBkaras ( from Garbha- 
dhana ) have to be again performed ( with Vedic mantras ) and 
then the upanayana is performed. 

One very important question that exercised the minds of some 
writers in medieval times was whether ksatriyas and vaisyas 
existed in the kali age. In some of the puranas it is said in a pro- 
phetic vein that MahapadmaNanda will destroy the ksatriyas and 
thereafter rulers will be of the sudra caste. For example, the 
Visnupurana IV. 23. 4-5 says * Mahapadma Nanda, the son of 
Mahanandi, born of a sudra woman would be extremely greedy 
(of power) and will destroy the whole ksafcriya race as if he were 
another Parasurama; thereafter sudras will be kings'. The Matsya 
272. 18-19 and the Bhagavata-purana XII. 1. 6-9 declare the 
same prophecies. The Visnupurana IV. 24. 44 remarks that Devapi, 
descendant of Puru, and Manu, descendant of Iksvaku, stay in

historian. The judgohas to give a decision on the evidence adduced by 
the parties before him; it is no part of his business to collect evidence 
for himself. But the role of a historian is entirely different. He 
must not only try to read all evidence available till the time he 
writes but he must himself ferret out all possible evidence and make 
searches in places where evidence is likely to be found. Above all he 
must be cautious in his condemnations of persons long dead on the 
strength of the meagre evidenco read by him. Mr. Telang wrote the 
paper above referred to in 1892, but long before that Pa"raskara (in 1886) 
and Apastamba (in 1885) had been translated and published in 'the 
Sacred Books of the East series. * But he, though a great judge and also a 
great Sanskrit scholar, nowhere shows that he cared to see whether sastric 
rules allowed the upanayana of a man himself at any age whatever 
( after some penance ). If he had seen those rules he would not have 
unjustly taken to task pandits that flourished two hundred years before 
him and attributed irregular motives to them. It does not appear that 
he made any search in the archives of the Udaipur Durbar to see how 
Shivaji traced his descent from the Sisodia clan, nor does it appear that 
he even went to Mudhol aDd other places in Maha"ra"$tra where ancient 
Maratha families have been holding sway for centuries. The papers 
recently published from the records of the Mudhol State amply establish 
Shivaji's claim to a Rajput lineage. 



Ch. VII 1 Ksatriyas and Kaliyuga 381 

Kalapagrama, are endowed with great yogic powers, will revive 
the ksatriya race when the krta age will start again after the 
present kali age comes to an end and that some ksatriyas exist on 
the earth like seed even in the kali age. Vayu(vol. I. 32, 39-40), 
Matsya(273. 56-58) have similar verses. Relying on such 
passages some medieval writers stated that there were no ksatriyas 
in their times. The Suddhitattva 923a of Raghunandana(p.268)after 
quoting the Visnupurana IV. 23. 4 and Manu X. 43 declares that 
ksatriyas existed till Mahanandi, that the so-called ksatriyas of 
his day were smdras and that similarly there were no vai&yas 
also. In the Sudra-Kamalakara occurs this verse ' The varnas 
are brahmanas, ksatriyas, vai^yas and 6udras, the first three 
being twice-born ; all these exist in the several yugas; 
but in the kali age only the first and the last remain'. 
N&ge&abhatta (first half of 18th century mb ) in his 
Vratyatapraya&cittanirnaya ( Chaukhamba Series) examines all 
the relevant Purana passages and states as his conclusion that 
real ksatriyas do not exist and so those, in whose families no 
upanayana had been performed for ten or twenty generations, 
are not ksatriyas even though they rule over kingdoms and no 
upanayana can be performed for such kings. It must be stated 
that such views, though held by some rigidly orthodox writers 
of extreme views, were not shared by most writers. All the 
smrbis speak of the duties of the four varnas even in the kali age. 
Parasara-smrti which is said to be the smrti par excellence for the 
kali age ( as stated in I. 24 ) does so. Almost all nibandha- 
karas ( authors of digests and commentaries ) discuss the 
privileges and duties of all varnas. The author of the Mitak- 
sara, who is rightly described as the best of all nibandha- 
karas t nowhere says that ksatriyas do not exist in the kali age. 
Numerous kings claimed to be descended from the Sun and the 
Moon. Hemadri in his Caturvargacintamani states that his 
patron was a scion of Somavarhsa ( vide H. Dh. vol. I p. 356 for 
quotations). The- princes of Rajputana and Central India claimed 
to have sprung from the Agnikunda on Mount Abu, viz. of the

four clans of Chohan, Parmar ( or Paramfira ), Solanki ( or 
Calukya), Padihar (or PratlhSra ). Vide Tod's Rajasthan 
( Madras ed. of 1873 ) vol. I chap. VII pp. 82 ff. . This theory of 
the Agnikulas is at least as old as 1000 A. D., since it is 
referred to in several inscriptions of the 11th century A. D. 
Vide the Vasantagadh Inscription of Paramara Purnapala 
dated sam. 1099 ( 1042-43 A. D.) in E. I. vol. IX p. 10 and the 
inscription of Camundaraja dated sam. 1136 (1079-1080 A. D.) 
in E. I. vol. XIV. p. 295. 

This question is now largely of academic interest. Whether 
a person is a sudra or a member of the regenerate classes assu- 
mes great importance in adoption, inheritance and succession. 
Therefore the question, whether ksatriyas exist in modern times, 
came before the British Indian courts over a hundred years ago. 
In Chouturya Run Murdun Syn v. Sahub Purhulad Syn 7 Moore's 
Indian Appeals 18 this question was argued and the Privy 
Council citing the authorities on both sides set the question at 
rest by remarking ( p. 46 ) * Their Lordships have nevertheless 
no doubt that the existence of the Khatri caste as one of the 
regenerate tribes is fully recognised throughout India and also 

that Rajputs in central India are considered to be of that 

class The courts in all cases assume that the four great 

classes remain'. The only question that is now permissible 
is whether a particular caste belongs to the regenerate classes 
or to the 6udra class. On this the courts often differ. Vide p. 75 
under Kayastha. In Maharaja of Kolhapur v. Sundaram Ayyar 
48 Mad. 1 it was held ( in an exhaustive judgment extending 
over 229 pages) that the Tanjore Maratha princes descended from 
Venkaji, the step-brother of the founder of the Maratha Empire, 
were fcudras and not ksatriyas. The learned judges ( at p. 51 ) 
quote Telang's dictum criticized by me above ( note 923 ), but 
refrain from expressing any decided opinion about the claim 
of Shivaji to be of ksatriya descent. In Subrao v Badha 52 
Bom. 497 it was held after a careful examination of autho- 
rities that the Marathas of Maharas^ra are sub-divided into 
three groups, viz. ( 1 ) the five families, ( 2 ) the ninety-six 
families and ( 3 ) the rest and that the first two groups are 
ksatriyas. It was further held that the tests to be applied in 
determining the class ( varna ) of a particular caste are three viz. 
the consciousness of the caste itself, the acceptance of that con- 
sciousness by other castes, and lastly its customs and usages. 

We have already seen ( in note 118) how even in the Vedic 
age there were non- Aryan tribes like the Kir&tae, Andhras,Pulin-

das, Mfitibas, that were described as dasyus by the Ait. Br.. One 
word that is of striking importance is mleccha. The Sat. Br. (III. 
2. 1. 23-24, S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 32 ) states that the asuras were 
defeated because they spoke an incorrect and corrupt dialect 
and that a brahmana should not, therefore, utter such a corrupt* 230 
speech and so should not become a mleccha and an asura. 
Gaut. IX 17 enjoins that one should not speak with mlecchas, 
impure or irreligious persons and Haradatta explains that 
mlecchas are the inhabitants of Ceylon and similar countries 
where there is no system of varnas and asramas. Visnu Dh . 
S. 64. 15 is to the same effect. Visnu Dh. S. 84. 1-2 and 
Sankha 14. 30 prescribe that one should not perform sraddha in a 
mleccha country nor should one visit such a country ( except on 
a pilgrimage ). Visnu Dh. S. 84. 4 states that that country where 
the system of the four varnas is not in vogue is mleccha terri- 
tory and Aryavarta is beyond it, while Manu II. 23 states that 
the mleccha country is beyond Aryavarta which land is fit for 
sacrifices and in which the black deer wanders naturally. Visva- 
rupa on Yaj. 1. 15 quotes Bharadvaja to the effect ' one should not 
study the language of the mlecchas, for it is declared ( in the 
Brahmanas ) that a corrupt word is indeed mleccha'. Vas. Dh. S. 
VI. 41 also enjoins that one should not learn the mleccha dialect. 
Manu X. 43-44 knew that many of the tribes called Pundrakas, 
Yavanas, Sakas spoke mleccha languages and also the language 
of the Aryas ( ralecchavaca^i-caryavacah sarve te dasyavah 
smrtah ). In Parasara IX 36 mlecchas are referred to as 
eaters of cow's flesh. That the mlecchas had affected the Sanskrit 
language by lending to it certain words follows from the 
discussion in Jaimini I. 3. 10 whether words like pika ( a 
cuckoo ), nema ( half ), sata ( a wooden vessel ), tamarasa ( a 
red lotus ) are to be understood in the sense in which mlecchas 
use them or certain meanings are to be assigned to them by 
deriving them from some root according to the rules of 
grammar, Nirukta and Nighantu and Jaimini's conclusion is 
that they are to be understood in the same sense in which 
mlecchas employ them M3d . Panini derives the word yavananl

and Patanjali speaks of the siege of Saketa and Madhyamika 
by the Yavana by whom scholars generally understand 
Menander. Asoka in his Rook Edict; No. 13 refers to Yona 
kings and it appears from his reference that brahmanas and 
sramanas were not found in the Yona country. A Yavanaraja 
TusSspha is mentioned as the governor of Kathiawar under 
Asoka in the inscription of Rudradaman at Junagadh ( E. I. 
vol. VIII. at p. 43 ). In the Prakrit Inscriptions the Yavanas 
are referred to as Yavana ( vide E, I. vol. VII. pp. 53-55 
at Karle No. 7 and 10 ) or Yona or Yonaka ( E. I. VIII. 90 
Nasik cave No. 18). In Kharavela's inscription also the form is 
Yavana ( E. I. 20 p. 79 ). In the Mahabharata the words 
Yavana and Saka occur very frequently. Vide notes above on 
these words. In the Dronaparva 119. 45-46 Yavana, Kamboja, 
Saka, Sahara, Kirata and Barbara are mentioned as one group 
fighting against Satyaki. In Drona 119. 47-48 they are referred 
to as dasyus and as having long and flowing beards. In the 
Strlparva 22. 11 Jayadratha is said to have had Kamboja and 
Yavana women in his harem. The word Yavana is generally 
taken as referring to the Greeks. But there are dissenting 
voices also. Dr. Otto Stein in ' Indian Culture ' denies that the 
word ever means Greeks and Dr. Tarn in his recent work on 
â¢ Greeks in Bactria and India ' p. 254 argues that the Yavanaa 
in the Nasik inscriptions were not Greeks but only Indian 
citizens of a Greek polis. The Santiparva 65. 17-22 prescribes 
for Yavanas, Sakas and similar tribes only the duties of 
obedience to parents and attendance on teachers and tending 
cattle and looking after agriculture, dedication of wells and 
making gifts to dvijas, ahiihsa, satya, absence of fury, ianca, 
adroha, maintenance of wife and child. Atri VII. 2 puts the 
receiving of gifts from or eating the food of or having sexual 
intercourse with the women of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, 
Bahllkas, Khasas, Dravidas on the same level with doing the 
same things with reference to nata, nartaka, svapaka &c. 
Apararka p. 923 quotes Vrddha*Yajnavalkya to the effect that 
the touch of Mlecchas is on the same level with that of 
cfindala, Bhilla and Paraslka. 

Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar in a very learned and scholarly paper 
in Indian Antiquary vol. 40 pp. 7-37 endeavours to establish that 
many non-Aryan persons belonging to tribes like the Yavanas, 
the Sakas became absorbed in the general mass of Hindu society, 
that even several of the princely families such as those of the 
Guhilots were not of pure Aryan descent and that the pride of 



Ch. VII 1 Non-Aryan elements 385 

the purity of oaste shown by many castes is not justified by 
history. He, therefore, appeals to modern Indians to forget all 
caste-exolusiveness and pride. But this appeal will be in vain. 
Merely showing that non- Aryan elements were absorbed in the 
body of the Aryan community several thousands or hundreds of 
years ago will not probably lessen that pride. Such people 
may retort that, whatever may have happened centuries ago, for 
about a thousand years there has been no such fusion. There- 
fore the appeal should rather be based on the futility of oaste 
exclusiveness in the 20th century when owing to the exigencies 
of the times any one can pursue any occupation, when a sense 
of one nation and one people is absolutely necessary for secur- 
ing to Indians their proper place in the sooiety of nations. 

The question of the re-conversion or re-entry of people con- 
verted to other faiths willingly or against their wishes will be 
briefly dealt with immediately below. 

A few words may first be said about the Vratyastoma. The 
Tandya-Mahabrahraana ( or the Panca-vimsa, as it is called 
from the number of Adhyayas) describes four vrfttyastomas 
in chap. 17. 1-4 ( khandas ). The meaning of many words and 
passages in that chapter of the brfihmana is uncertain and some- 
what cryptic. The four vratyastomas were ekahas (i. e. sacrifices 
taking one day only ). Tandy a 17. 1. 1 begins with the story 
that when the gods went to the heavenly world some dependents 
of theirs who lived the vratya life were left behind on the 
earth. Then through the favour of the gods the dependents got 
at the hands of Maruts the Sodasastoma ( containing 16 stotras ) 
and the metre ( viz. anustubh ) and then the dependents secured 
heaven. The Sodasastoma is employed in each of the four 
vratyastomas, the first of which (17. 1 ) is meant for all 
vratyas, the 2nd is meant for those who are abhiiasta ( who are 
wicked or guilty of heavy sins and so censured ) and lead a 
vratya life, the third for those who are youngest and lead 
a vratya life, and the fourth who are very old and yet lead a 
vratya life. Some of the passages convey a tolerably clear idea 
of what the vratyas were like. Those who â¢** lead the vratya 
life are base and are reduced to a baser state, since they do 
not observe student-hood ( brahmacarya ) nor do they till the 
soil nor engage in trade. It is by the Sodasastoma that they

386 History of Dkarma&Satra [ Ch. VII 

can attain this ( superior status ). This shows that the vratyas 
did not perform upanayana and did not study the Veda, nor 
did they do even what vai^yas do. Another passage says * those 
swallow poison who eat food of the common people as food 
fit for brShmanas, -who call good words bad, who strike with 
a stick him who does not deserve to be beaten ( or punished ), 
who, though not initiated, speak the speech of the initiated. 
The Soda&astoma has the power to remove the guilt of these. 
That ( in this rite ) there are four Sodas astom as, thereby they 
are freed from guilt.' 9B5 This passage indicates that the vratyas 
spoke the same language as the orthodox people, but were rough 
in their ways and lax as regards the food they partook of. 
They were thus outside the pale of orthodox Aryan society and 
they were brought within it by the Vratyastoma described in 
the T&ndya. The origin of the word vratya is lost in the mists 
of antiquity. The 15th Kanda of the Atharvaveda glorifies the 
vratya and identifies him with the Creator and Supreme Being. 
The word is probably derived from vrata ( group ) and means 
* he who belongs to or moves in a group.' It is possible to 
derive the word from vrata. Originally vratyas appear to have 
been groups of people who spoke the same language as orthodox 
firyas, but did not follow their discipline and habits. The word 
vrata occurs in Rg. 1. 163. 8, III. 26. 6, V. 53. 11. Sayana also 
perceived the difficulty raised by the glorification of the vratya 
in the Atharvaveda 15. 1. 1 and his note is interesting, since 
he says that the description does not apply to all vratyas, but 
only to some very powerful, universally respected and holy 
vratya who was, however, not in the good books of the 
brahmanas that were solely devoted to their own rites and 
sacrifices. Katyftyanafcrauta XXII. 4. 1-28 and Ap. Srauta 
XXII. 5, 4-14 also deal with Vratyastoma. Katyayana des- 
cribes the four vratyastomas and adds 926 ' by performing the 
vratyastoma sacrifice, they should cease to be vratyas and 
become eligible for social intercourse with the orthodox aryas.' 
The Par. gr. II. 5 quotes the last sutra of Katyayana with the

In the Vr5tyata-6uddbisarhgraha provision is made 9Z8 for 
the purification of vratyas even after twelve generations ( vide 
pp. 7 and 22-24 ) and that work adds ( p. 42 ) that the Vratya- 
stoma like the penance for an avaklrnin is to be performed in 
the ordinary fire ( laukika agni ). It also suggests easy substi- 
tutes for the lengthy and trying penance of twelve years 
prescribed by Ap. 

Hinduism has not been an avowedly proselytizing reli- 
gion. In theory it could not be so. For about two thousand 
years the caste system has reigned supreme and no one can in 
theory be admitted to the Hindu fold who is not born in it. 
A Hindu may lose caste, be excommunicated and driven out 
of the fold of Hinduism, if he be guilty of very serious 
lapses and refuses to undergo the praya^cittas prescribed by the 
smrtis. Gaut. 20. 15 states that he who was guilty of a misdeed 
for which death was prescribed as a penance became purified 
only by dying. But Gaut. himself prescribed death ( 21. 7 ) as 
penance only for the sins of brfthmana-murder, drinking spiri- 
tuous liquor and incest. Even as regards these three, lesser 
penances were prescribed by some smrtis as alternatives ( e. g. 
vide Manu XI. 72, 74-8, 92, 108 ). Whon the sinner performed 
the prayascitta prescribed by the sastras, he was to be welcomed 
by his relatives, who took a bath along with him in a holy river 
or the like and threw therein an unused jar filled with water; 
they were not to find fault with him and were to completely 
associate with him in all ways ( Manu XI. 186-187, Y5j. 
III. 295, Vas. 15, 20, Gaut. 20. 10-14). Vas. 15. 17 says that 
those who were patita were to be re-admitted to all sooial

intercourse when they performed the prescribed penances 
( patifcSnam tu caritavrat&nSm pratyuddharah ). But if the 
sinner refused to undergo the prescribed praya&citta, then a 
peculiar procedure called ghataspho^a ( breaking a jar ) was 
prescribed. In such a case the sinner*s relatives ( sapindas ) 
made a slave girl whose face was turned to the south thrust 
aside with her foot an earthen jar full of water so that all water 
flowed out of it, then the relatives were to observe mourning 
for one day and night ( as he was deemed to be dead to them ) 
and from that day they were to stop speaking or sitting with 
him, and all other social intercourse and he was to be given no 
inheritance ( vide Manu XL 183-185, Yfij. III. 294, Gaut. 20. 
2-7 ). In this way the obstinate sinner went out of the Hindu 
fold. The ancient smrtis do not expressly prescribe any rites 
for bringing into the brahmanic or Hindu fold a person who 
or whose ancestors did not belong to it. But as Hinduism has 
been extremely tolerant 928 * (barring a few exceptional instances) 
it had a wonderful power of quiet and unobtrusive absorption. 
Jf a person, though of foreign ancestry, conformed to Hindu 
social usages in outward behaviour, in course of time his 
descendants became absorbed into the vast Hindu community. 



928a. A few striking instances of religious tolerance among kings 
and common people may be cited with advantage. The Pala king Mahipsla I 
granted a village to a brShmana of the VsjasaneyasSkhS in honour of 
Lord Buddha ( E. I. vol. 14 p. 324 ). Similarly the king Subhakaradeva 
who was a great devotee of Buddha (paramasaugata) granted two villages 
to 200 brShmanas ( Neulpur grant in E. I. vol. 15 p. 1 ) ; vide also E. I* 
vol. 15 p. 293. The famous Emperor Harfa, whose father was a great 
devotee of the Sun, and who was himself a great devotee of &iva, pays 
the highest honour to his elder brother Rsjyavardhana who was a very 
devout Buddhist (paramasaugata). Vide the Madhuban copperplate 
Inscription in E. I. vol. I. p. 67 and E. I. vol. VII. p. 155. CJ^avadSta 
makes large gifts to brShmanas as well as to communities of Buddhist 
monks (vide Nasik Inscriptions No. 10 and No. 12 in E.I. vol. VIII p. 78 
and p. 82). The Valabhi king GuhasenaÂ«who was himself a Mshedvara 
( a fiaiva ) made a grant of four villages to a bhik^u-sangha. From the 
Paharpur plate of the Gupta year 159 (478-79 A. D. ) it appears that a 
brShmana and his wife deposited three dlnSras with a city council for 
the maintenance of the worship of arhats at a vihSra ( E. I. Vol. XX. p. 
59). The Mulgund inscription of the time of Rs^trakma Krfoa II. ( of 
902-3 A. D.) shows that to a temple of Jina at Mulgund a field was given 
by a brShmana of the Bellsja family (E.I. vol. XIII. p. 190). Vide 
Rice's * Mysore and Coorg from Inscriptions ' pp. 113 and 207 for an 
account how a Vijayanagar king settled the dispute between Jainas 
and Srlvai^navaa in 1368 A. P, 



Oh, VII ] Absorption of non- Aryans 389 

This prooess has gone on for at least two thousand years. The 
beginnings of it are found in the SSntiparva chap. 65 where 
Indra tells the Emperor Mandhatr to bring all foreign people 
like the Yavanas under brahmanioal influence. The Besnagar 
column inscription shows that the Yona ( yavana ) Heliodora 
( Heliodorus ) son of Diya ( Dion ) was a bhagavata ( devotee 
of Vasudeva ). Vide J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 1053 and 1087 and 
J. B, B. R A. S. vol. 23 p. 104. In the caves at Nasik, Karle 
and other places many of the donors are said to have been 
yavanas (vide E. I. vol. VII, pp. 53-54, 55, E. I. vol. VIII, 
p. 90, E. I. vol. XVIII, p. 325 ). Several inscriptions state that 
Indian kings married Huna princesses, e. g. Allata of the 
Quhila dynasty married a Huna princess named Hariyadevi 
( I. A. vol. 39 p. 191 ), king Ya^atikarnadeva of the Kalacuri 
dynasty is said to have been the son of Karnadeva and Avalla- 
devl, a Huna princess. These and similar examples show that 
persons of foreign descent and their children were absorbed 
into the Hindu community from time to time. This absorption 
is illustrated in modern times by the case of Fanindra Deb v. 
Rajeshwar ( L. R. 12 I. A. 72 ) in which it was found that 
a family in Kooch Behar not originally Hindu had adopted 
certain Hindu usages and it was held that it had not taken 
over the practice of adoption. How Hindu customs and 
incidents persist even after conversion to Islam is strikingly 
shown by the Khojas and Kutchi Memons of the Bombay Presi- 
dency, who though made converts to Islam several centuries 
ago, were held by the courts in India to have retained the 
ancient Hindu Law of succession and inheritance. 928b 

The problem of taking back into the Hindu fold persons 
who were forcibly converted to other faiths has engaged the 
attention of smrtis. Moslems first attacked India in the 8th 
century from the direction of the province of Sindh. This 
invasion led to the enslavement and forcible conversion of 
many people. It appears that Devala and other smrtikaras 
tackled with the problem of taking back such people. The 
Devala smrfei opens with a question by the sages put to Devala 
who was sitting on the banks of the Sindhu at ease as to how 

928 b. The Cutchi Memoes Act ( XLVI of 1920 ) as amended by Act 
XXIV of 1923 now enables Cutchi Memons by observing certain forma- 
lities prescribed by the Act to become free from the application of 
Hindu Law. By Act XXVI of 1937 it is declared that the personal law 
will apply to all Muslims instead of customary law on going through 
certain procedure prescribed by the Act. 



390 History of Dharma&astra [ Ob. VII 

brSbmanas and members of tbe other varnas when carried off 
by MIecchas were to be purified and restored to caste. The 
following verses of the Devala-smrti are very instructive 
on this point. Verses 7-10 declare that when a brahmana is 
carried off by MIecchas and he eats or drinks forbidden food 
or drink or has sexual intercourse with women he should not 
have approached, he becomes purified by doing the penance of 
candrayaya and paraka, that a ksatriya becomes pure by under- 
going parafca and padakrcchra, a vai6ya by half of paraka 
and a sudra by the penance of paraka for five days. Then 
verses 17-22 are most important m Â°. ' When persons are forci- 
bly made slaves by MIecchas, cSnd&las and robbers, are com- 
pelled to do dirty acts, such as killing cows and other animals 
or sweeping the leavings of the food (of MIecchas) or eating 
the leavings of the food of MIecchas or partaking of the flesh 
of apses, camels and village pigs, or having intercourse with their 
women, or are forced to dine with them, then the penance for puri- 
fying a dvijati that has stayed for a month in this way is pr5- 
japatya, for one who had consecrated Vedic fires ( and stayed 
one month or less ) it is cSndrSyana or paraka; for one who 
stays a year (with MIecchas in this condition of things) it is 
both cftndrayana and parSka ; a fctidra who stays ( in this con- 
dition) for a month becomes pure by krcchrapida; a 6udra 
who stays a year should drink y&vaka for half a month. The 
appropriate prayafccitta should be determined by learned brfih- 
manas when a person has stayed ( in the above circumstances 
among MIecchas) for over a year; in four years the person 
( who stays in the above circumstances among MIecchas ) is 
reduced to their condition ( i. e. becomes a mlecoha and there

is no pr&yaicitta for him).' The Praya6cittaviveka states 
ihat after four years death is the only purifier for him. md 
Three more verses of Devala ( 53-55 ) also deserve considera- 
;ion ' One who was forcibly seized by Mlecohas for five, six or 
seven years or from ten to twenty years, is purified by under- 
going two Prajapatyas. Beyond this there is no purification ; 
these penances are meant only for him who has simply stayed 
among Mlecchas. He who had stayed with Mlecohas from 
Sve to twenty years is purified by undergoing two Candrayanas\ 
These verses are apparently inconsistent with the verses 
cited above ( 17-22 ), but they most probably mean this that 
if a man only stayed among Mlecchas for 5 to 20 years, but 
has not done any of the forbidden things such as eating 
ucchista or the flesh of asses &c., then he can be taken back 
even after so many years. This would be an exception to the 
rule contained in verse 22. There is no reason why the reason- 
ing of Devala should not be extended to persons who have been 
in the condition stated in verses 17-22 for over four years. 
In the Paficada&I (Trptidlpa v. 239) we have the following very 
significant passage 988 * ' just as a brahmana seized by Mlecchas 
and afterwards undergoing the appropriate prayaficitta does not 
become confounded with Mlecchas ( but returns to his original 
status of being a brahmana) so the Intelligent Soul is not really 
to be confounded with the body and other material adjuncts/ 
This establishes that the great Vidyaranya, who after Sarhkara- 
carya, is the greatest figure among acaryas, approved of the 
view that a brfthmana even though enslaved by Mlecchas could 
be restored to his original status. 

Under Shivaji and the Peshwas it appears that several 
persons that had been forcibly made Moslems were restored to 
caste after under-going praya^citta ( vide notes 2321-2 below for 
examples ). But this was done in only a few instances. 

In modern times there is a movement among Hindus 
called iuddhi or patitaparavartana (purification or bringing 
back into the Hindu fold those who had fallen away from it ). 
In a very few cases persons born in western countries have been 
taken into the Hindu fold by the performance of vratyastoma

and other rites. But such instances are very rare and are not 
yet supported by the vast majority of Hindus. It has been 
shown above that for taking back a man who was onoe a 
Hindu but had left Hinduism, there is smrti authority in 
Devala and others and the authority of the Nibandhak&ras. 
Punarupanayana ( performing upanayana again ). 

In certain cases an upanayana has to be performed again. 
The Asv. 9M gr. ( I. 22. 22-26 ) prescribes that in punarupanayana 
the cutting of the hair and production of intelligence ( medhS- 
janana) are optional, there are no rules about paridana 
( giving in charge of deities ) and about the time ( i.e. it may be 
performed at any time and no paridana is necessary ) and 
instead of the usual G&yatrl, he should recite ' tat savitur 
vrnlmahe ' ( Rg. V. 82. 1. ). When a person in whose family 
one Veda is studied ( e. g. the Rgveda ) wants to study another 
Veda ( e. g. Yajurveda ), he had to undergo a fresh upanayana. 
The Asv. gr. sufcra is interpreted in this way by some. Hara- 
datfca on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 says that as the Savitrl ( i. e. 
Gayatrl, Rg. III. 62. 10 ) is recited for all Vedas according to 
the Brahmana passage quoted by Ap. one upanayana is 
sufficient for the study of the three Vedas in succession, but if a 
person wants to study the Atharvaveda after studying another 
Veda, then a fresh upanayana is necessary. This is one kind 
of punarupanayana. Another kind of punarupanayana takes 
place when in the first upanayana the principal rite viz. placing 
his hands on the boy's shoulders and bringing the student near 
the teacher is left off through oversight or the first upanayana 
takes place in a season other than vasanta ( spring ) or in the 
dark half of a month or on a day which was anadhyaya 98 Â° 
( unfit for Vedic study ) or on a galagraha (vide note 642 above) 
or in the latter part of the day. A third kind of punar- 
upanayana is one which is by way of prayascitta for 
certain sins or lapses from good conduct. 921 Gaut. 23. 2-5

prescribes the penance called Tapfcakrcchra arid punarupanayana 
for one guilty of drinking wine ( sura ) in ignorance or 
parbaking of human urine, faeces and semen and the flesh of 
wild beasts, camels, asses, village cocks, and village hogs. Vas. 
( 23. 30 ) also has a similar sutra. Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 25 quotes 
a verse * if a person belonging to the three varnas unknowingly 
drinks sura ( wine ) or faeces, he has to undergo punarupanayana ' 
and says ( II. 1. 29 ) that if a brahmacarl carries a corpse ( other 
than that of his parents or teacher) he has to undergo punar- 
upanayana . Manu V. 9L and Visnu Dh. S. 22. 86 prescribe the 
same. In the Baud. gr. paribhasasutra ( 1. 12. 4-6 ) it is said that 
on partaking of honey, or flesh, sraddha food or food from those in 
impurity on birth, or the milk of a cow before the lapse of ten 
days or the milk of a sandhinl cow, mushrooms or the resin 
exuded from trees, vilayana (a product of milk?), the food 
prepared for a number of people in common or the food of 
prostitutes, a man has to undergo punarupanayana and, 
according to some, also if he goes to a forbidden coun- 
try, 9S2 viz. Sauras^ra ( Kathiawar ), Sindhu, and Sauvlra 
( Sind and the territory to its south and east ), Avanti 
( Ujjftin ), Daksinapatha ( Deccan ), a brahmana has to undergo 
punarupanayana ( except when he goes on a pilgrimage ). It 
then sets out the procedure ( such as a homa, putting a fuel 
stick of palasa on the fire and oblations of cooked food and 
ajya) and adds that in punarupanayana shaving, daksina, 
girdle, staff, deer-skin, begging for food and vratas do not take 
place. 

The Vaik. smarfca ( VI. 9-10 ) contains similar rules 
for punarupanayana. 933 Apararka ( p. 1160) quotes Paithlnasi 
to the effect that if a grown-up person drinks the milk 
of sheep or of a she-ass, she-camel or of a woman, he has 
to undergo punarupanayana and also the penance called 
prajapatya.

It appears thai from very early times Vedic studies were 
stopped on various grounds. The Tai. Ar. 9S4 II, 15 has a very 
important statement on this subject. * Indeed as to this yajna 
( brahmayajna ) there are two cases in which the study of the 
Veda ceases, namely, when the man himself is impure or when 
the place is impure \ Tho Sat. Br. 955 has a passage in which 
several occasions when Vedic study was ordinarily stopped are 
mentioned and it is added that those occasions do not prevent 
the repetition of Vedic texts as Brahmayajna. * Therefore one 
knowing this should certainly repeat the Veda as Brahmayajfiat 
when the wind blows, when lightning flashes, when it thunders 
or when there is a fall of thunderbolt, in order that vasatkaras 
may not be fruitless \ The Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 4. 12. 3. ) quotes the 
Vajasaneyi Brahmana ( the Satapatha ) to the effect that " Vedic 
study is Brahmayajna; when it thunders, when lightning 
flashes, when there is a fall of the thunderbolt, when the wind 

blows, these are its vasatkaras ; 9S6 therefore when fruitless ". 

The Ait. Ar. ( V. 3. 3 ) notes that if there be rain when it is not 
the season of rainfall, he should make a break by observing 
cessation of Vedic study for three nights. 937 

The subject of anadhyaya is discussed in the grhya and 
dharmasutras and in almost" all smrtis. It is not possible to give 
for want of space the differences between the several works- 
Among sutras and smrtis the most exhaustive and lengthy treat- 
ment is found in Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 3. 9. 4. to I. 3. 11 ), Gaut. 
16. 5-49, Sankhayana gr. IV. 7 ( S. B. E. vol. 29 pp. 115-118 ), 
Manu IV. 102-128, Yaj. I. 144-151. The subject is also treated

at length in the Sm. G, Smrtyarthasara, the Sarhskara kau- 
stubha ( pp. 564-570 ), the Samskara-ratnamala ( pp. 327-339 ) 
and other Nibandha works. In the following an attempt is 
made to present a tolerably exhaustive list of anadhyayas 
together with a few references to the original sources. 

Among tithis the following are anadhyayas. On the first , 
the 8fch, the 14th, 15th tithis ( PaurnamasI and Amavasya ) Jthere 
was to be cessation of Vedic Study for the whole day ; vide 
Manu IV. 113-114, Yaj I. 146 (in both pratipad is not 
expressly mentioned ) and Harlta. Patanjali in the Maha- 
bhasya ( vol. II. p. 386 ) refers to anadhyaya on amavasya and 
14th tithi. There is a famous verse of the Ramayana m which 
shows that pratipad also was a holiday. Gaufc. says that there 
was no holiday on the full moon days of the twelve months, 
but only on the full moon days of Asadha, Kartika and 
Phalguna. The Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 42-43 quotes a verse 929 
'( Vedic study on ) the eighth tithi kills the teacher, 14th kills 
the pupil, 15th kills learning \ Manu ( IV. 114 ) has a similar 
verse. Apararka 94 Â° ( p. 189 ) quotes from the Nrsimhapurana 
verses to the effect that there is to be no teaching ( of the Veda ) 
on MahanavamI ( 9th of Asvina, bright half ), on BharanI ( i. e. 
the tithi when the moon is in BharanI naksatra after Bhadra- 
pada full moon ), Aksatatrblya ( 3rd of Vaisakha, bright half ) 
and RathasaptatuI ( 7th of Magha, bright half ). Similarly 
there is to be anadhyaya on what are called Yugadi and Man- 
vantaradi tithis. Yugadi tithis according to Visnupurana 9il 
and Brahmapurana quoted by Apararka ( p. 425 ) are Vaisakha- 
suklatrtlya, Kartika sukla navami, Bhadrapada krsna trayodasl 
and Magha Purnima ( they are respectively the beginnings of 
the four yugas, krta, treta, dvapara and kali). The Sm. C. 
( I. p. 58 ) quotes the Naradlyapurana * on the day when 
uttarayana and daksinayana first take place, on Visuva (the two

days in fche year when the day and night are equal ), on the 
tithis when Visnu sleeps and awakes from sleep ( i. e. Asadha- 
sukla-ekadasl and Karfcika-sukla-ekadasI ), on Yugadi and 
Manvadi tithis there is anadhyaya, The tithis on which the 
fourteen manvantaras are supposed to begin are quoted 
below. 948 According to a purana passage quoted in the Sm. C. 
( I. p. 58 ) theâ¢ is anadhyaya on Sopapada tithis 943 ( viz. 
Jyestha sukla 2, Asvina sukla 10, and Magha sukla 4 and 12 ). 
Sometimes on the same day there are two tithis ; hence the rule 
laid down is that if on any day a particular tithi ( which is 
declared to be anadhyaya ) is shown in the calendar as 
extending for three muhurtas at sunrise or at sunset, then the 
whole of that day is anadhyaya. 944 

Yaj. ( I. 148-151 ) speaks of 37 talkalika anadhyayas ( i. e. 
where Veda study is suspended only as long as the occasion or 
disturbance stated lasts ). They are : when there is noise 
created by a dog, jackal, ass, owl, singing of saman % playing on 
a flute and the cries of the distressed ( these are 7 ) ; in the 
vicinity or presence of impure things, of a corpse, or a sudra or 
antya ( i. e. one of the untouchables ), cemetery, a patita ( one 
guilty of mabapataka ) ; when the place ( of study ) has become 
impure or when the man himself is impure ; when there is 
continuous flashing of lightning or continuous peals of 
thunder; while one's hands are wet after taking one's meals; 
in the midst of water ; at midnight ; when a violent wind is 
blowing ; when there is a rainfall of dust, when the quarters 
are lit up by sudden ( and strange ) lights ; at the two twilights ; 
when there is fog; when there is a fright ( caused by robbers &c. ) ; 
when one is running ; when the smell of something rotten or 
impure spreads ; when a distinguished visitor comes to fche 
house ; when one rides an ass, a camel, a conveyance ( like a 
chariot ), an elephant, a horse, a boat, or climbs a tree or is in 
a desert ( or barren ) place. A few explanatory words may

be added. According to Ap. Db. S. I. 3. 10. 19 when wolves 
howl, or when there is the sound of any musical instrument, 
or of weeping, singing or of the recitation of a Saman there is 
anadhyaya. Gaut. 16. 7 mentions the sound of bana ( a 
kind of vlna ), bherl ( a drum ), mrdanga, garta ( a chariot ) 
and the distressed. Manu ( IV. 123-124 ) explains that when 
a saman is heard, one should not study any portion of the 
Jfcgveda or Yajurveda, because the gods are the devatas of 
Rgveda, the Yajurveda deals with men ( it enjoins actions to 
be done by men ), Samaveda has the pitrs as its deities ; hence 
its sound has something of the impure or uncanny about it. 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 27 prescribes 945 that there should be no 
Vedic study as long as there are clouds when it is not the 
season for clouds, when there is a halo round the sun or 
moon, when there is a rainbow, or when there is parhelion 
or a star with a tail ( like a fish ). Gaut. 16. 19, Ap. Dh. 
I. 3. 9. 14-15, Vas. 13. 11 say that there is anadhyaya as 
long as a corpse or a oandala is in the village or town. 
Gaut. 16, 45 states the view of some that the Veda can never 
be studied in a city ; there is no Veda study as long as there 
is an assembly of people ( Manu IV. 108 ) or while the student 
is lying down or has stretched his feet or placed them on a cot 
or stool, or while he sits on his haunches winding round his 
knees and hips a piece of cloth ( Manu IV. 112., Vas. Dh. 
S. 13. 23, Visnu Dh. S. 30. 17 ). There is to be anadhyaya 
when one is answering the calls of nature ( Manu IV. 109 ), 
or when one has not yet sipped water ( acamana ) after taking 
food, or after partaking of meal (Manu IV. 112), when 
there is wordy argument or there is an affray or a fight or 
when one is wounded or when blood flows from the body 
( Manu IV. 122 ) or when one suffers from indigestion or 
vomits or has sour eructations ( Manu IV. 121 ). 

In certain cases anadhyaya lasts only for a portion of 
the day. When the wind blows by day strong enough to 
carry off clouds of dust ( Gaut. 16. 5 ) there is anadhyaya 
during the day ( but not at night even if the wind is still 
strong ) or when on a festive occasion like upanayana there is 
anadhyaya after dinner that day ( Gaut. 16. 43); when in tho 
morning twilight fire has been kindled for homa and there are

flashes of lightning and thunder ( not accompanied by rain ) 
there is anadhySya till the sun sets. Gaut. ( 16. 32 ) prescribes 
anadhyaya for the rest of the day when the king in whose 
country a man dwells dies ; when a strong wind that was blow- 
ing stops, there is anadhyaya for a muhurta i. e. two ghatikas 
(Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 28) or when there is the howling of 
salavrka (hyaena?) or a jackal moving about alone there is 
anadhyaya till one gets up from sleep ( ibid I. 3. 11. 29 ). 

In some cases there is anadhyaya for the whole day and 
night. According to Yaj. L 145-147 there is such an anadhyaya 
when there is thunder at the twilight time, there is a fall of the 
thunderbolt or earth-quake or the fall of a meteor, when one 
finishes Samhita or Brahmana ( of the sakha one is studying ) 
or when one finishes the study of the Aranyaka portion of one's 
Veda; when there is an eclipse of the sun or moon, or when it is 
the first day after the season ohanges or when a person partakes 
of sraddha food or accepts a gift on sraddha (except in Ekoddista 
sraddha); when a beast, frog, mongoose, dog, snake, cat or 
mouse passes between the teacher and pupil ( Manu IV. 126 
also ) or when the banner of Indra is raised or taken down. 
Manu IV. 110 lays down anadhyaya for three days when one 
accepts invitation for an Ekoddista sraddha or when the king 
dies or when there is an eclipse. This last refers to an eclipse 
where the sun or the moon sets while still eclipsed. Gaut. 1.60 
prescribes cessation for three days when dogs and others come 
between. This is explained as referring to the first lesson in 
Veda, while the words of Manu and Yaj. are held to refer to 
repetition. Raising the banner in honour of Indra was a 
festival prescribed for kings in the Kausika ><*utra 140 and other 
works. The banner was raised usually in Bhadrapada ( or 
sometimes in Asvina) on the 12th of the bright half when the 
moon was in conjunction with utfcarasadba, sravana oi dhanistha 
constellation and it was taken down in the same month on the 
bharanl constellation ( vide Sm. C, I. p. 59 ). According to the 
Brhat-Sarhhita (chap. 43 ) of Varaha this festival lasted from 
the 8th to the 12 tb day of Bhadrapada sukla. Manu ( IV- 119 ) 
prescribes anadhyaya for a day and night on the Astaka days 9n 
and on the last day of each of the six rtus ( seasons ). 

946. The astaka" homa was performed on the 8th of the dark half 
of the four months from Mgrga4IrÂ§a ( according to &Jv. gr. Ii. 4. 1 ) or 
(according to others) of three months of Pan$a, Magha and PhBlgmia. 
Gaut. 16. 33-39 prescribed three daya* anadhya"ya on each of (he three 
A^tÂ»\kas or according to *ome only on the last A^takff. 



Cb. Vll J Awtdhyayufi 399 

In a few cases the anadhyaya was akalika 947 i. c. lasted 
for one day (60 ghatikas) from the time when the cause began 
to operate up to the same hour next clay. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 3. llÂ« 
25-26 ) lays down this kind of anadhyaya if out of three viz. 
flashing of lightning, thunder and rain, one or two occur at a 
time when it is no season for rain ; there is this anadhyaya for 
all vidyas at all times, when there is an eclipse of the sun or tho 
moon or there is an earthquake or a whirlwind or fall of 
meteors. Manu IV. 103-105 and Gautama 16. 22-23 are similar 
to Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 3. 11. 25-26 and Manu IV. 118 prescribes akalika 
anadhyaya when a village is thrown into confusion by thieves 
or there is a commotion due to a conflagration and in the case 
of all portentous phenomena (such as rain of blood or stones; 
vide Vas. 13. 35 ). Gaut. ( 16. 47-48 ) adds that the performer 
of a sraddha ( whether he actually serves cooked food to brah- 
manas or only makes gifts of money and corn &c. ) has to 
observe this anadhyaya (vide Manu IV. 117 also). 

Anadhyaya for three days was prescribed in a few cases. 
If lightning, thunder and rain all appear together when it is 
not the proper season for them, there is anadhyaya for three 
days ( Ap. Dh. I. 3. 11. 23 ). Vide note 937 above. In the 
utsarga and upakarana of the Vedas, on the death of gurus 
( persons worthy of respect like the father-in-law ), ou the 
Astakas and on the death of near agnates ( like brother, 
nephew &c. ) there is anadhyaya for three days 948 ( Ap. Dh. S. 
I. 3. 10. 2-3 ). Gaut. ( 6. 38-41 ) is similar to Ap. The Harlta 
dharmasutra 949 prescribes anadhyaya for three days on the 
death of one's upadhyaya, or of the king or of a srotriya or 
fellow pupil, on eclipses of the sun and tho moon, on the taking 
down of the banner of Indra and on the death of one's acarya.

400 History of Dharmasastra [ Uh. VII 

Manu ( IV. 110 and 119 ) prescribes anadhyaya for throo day a 
on accepting invitation for ekoddista bxuldha, on the death of 
the king, on eclipses and on upakarma or utsarga. Yaj. I. 144 
contains similar rules. 

Ap. Dh. S. (I. 3. 10. 4) prescribes 12 days* anadhyaya on 
the death of one's parents and acarya. Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 32 
prescribes 950 three days' anadhyaya on the death of one's 
father. This rule must be taken as referring only to a 
brahmacarl. Vas. ( 13. 39-10 ) proscribes three days' anadhyaya 
ou the death of one's acarya and one day's on the death of the 
son or wife of the acarya. 

The Smrtyarthasara ( p. 10) mentions some occasions whon 
anadhyaya may extend to a month, to six months, or a year. 
Ap. D. S. I. 3. 9. 1. prescribes that, when upakarma is performed 
on tho full moon day of Sravana, for a month thereafter ono 
should not study Veda in the first part of the night ( ha may do 
so after that at night or in the day ). 

Apararka (p. 192 ) quotes a verse from Yama 951 that thero 
can be no Vedic study under the shade of certain trees liko 
SlesmStaka, Salmali (silk-cotton), Madhuka, Kovidara and 
Kapitthaka. 

Both Gaut. ( 16. 49 ) and Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 34 state that 
besides the anadhyayas expressly mentioned by them thero aro 
others which may be learnt from the several smrtis and from 
tho assemblies of learned men. 952 

It would be noticed how the number of anadhyayas is 
rather too numerous for rapid and effective study. Therefore 
certain rules are laid down to explain what is that is forbidden 
on those days. 

In the first place anadhyaya may be vacika ( concerned

the Veda in the mind ). Baud. Dh. S. I. 952 11. 40-41 says 
that the rule about anadhyaya on portentous happenings for a 
day and night does not apply to manasa study ; but even 
manasa study is forbidden when there is impurity due to birth 
or death. Gaut. 16. 46 says the same. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 20 
allows ( in general ) mental study ( not vocal ) on anadhyaya 
days. Vide also Ap. Dh. S. I 11. 32. 12-13. 

The Ap. Srautasutra 954 ( 24. 1. 37 ) says that the rules 
about anadhyaya apply only to the learning of Vedic mantras 
but have no application to their employment in various rites, 
Jaimini 955 ( XII. 3. 18-19 ) establishes the proposition that the 
rules about anadhyaya being prescribed for acquisition of the 
Vedic mantras have no application to their employment in 
sacrifices. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 9 lias a sutra which shows 
remarkable agreement with the words of Jaimini. 

We saw above that according to the Tai. Ar. the rules of 
anadhySya do not apply to the daily performance of Brahma- 
yajna ( i. e. to the repetition of the Vedic texts already learnt ). 
Manu II. 105 says that there is no concern about anadhyaya as 
to the lores ( the angas like grammar, Nirukta &o. ) helpful to 
( understanding of ) the Veda, the obligatory svadhy&ya ( i. o. 
brahmayajfia ) and the mantras to be used in homa. Saunaka 956 
quoted in the Sm. C. says there is no anadhyaya as to repeating 
the Vedic texts in the obligatory rites and in japa nor in kamya 
rites, in sacrifices or in the parayana ( repeating the Veda 
already learnt); the anadhyaya rules apply only to the first 
learning of Vedic mantras and to their teaching. The Smrtyar- 
thasara 957 ( p. 10 ) says that those who have a slippery memory 
or those who have to commit to memory extensive Vedic texts

should study the Vedangas, nyaya (logic), mlmamsa and 
dharmasastras on all anadhyayas except on 1st, 8th, 14th and 
full moon and new moon days. Some digests quote a verse from 
the Kurmapurana 958 that there is no anadhyaya for the study of 
Vedangas, of itihasa, puranas, dharmasastras and other sastras ; 
but on parva days the study of even these should be dropped* 
This shows that these tithis were the only close holidays on 
which there was complete cessation of all study, \tfhether Vodic 
or non-Vedic. That is, these were what are called nitya holidays 
while the rest are naimittika anadhyayas. Even now these 
nitya anadhyayas are observed by vaidikas and by Pandits in 
their Sanskrit schools ( particularly amavasya ). 

It will be seen that though some of the occasions for 
anadhyaya are somewhat strange and bizarre, underlying 
most of them there are reasonable and understandable 
principles. Vedic study depended in the first place on memo- 
rizing. Committing sacred texts to memory ( without in most 
cases understanding their meaning ) required close attention 
and concentration. Therefore, all occasions which caused dis- 
turbance or distraction of mind were held to be anadhyayas. 
But the same concentration was not necessary for reciting in 
sacrifices or japa or brahma-yajfia what had already been 
committed to memory. Hence such occasions were not 
anadhyayas for those purposes. 

It was believed that 959 if a person taught the Vedic lore 
or studied it on anadhyaya days, he incurred loss as to ( long ) 
life, offspring, cattle, intelligence and the merit accumulated 
by him. 

Keianta or godana : â This samskara consists in shaving 
the head and also the hair on the other parts of the body ( such 
as arm-pits, chin ). Par. gr., Yaj. ( I. 36 ) and Manu ( II. 65 ) 
employ the word kesanta, while Asv. gr., San. gr., Gobhila and 
other grhyasutras employ the word godana. In the Sat. 960 Br.

of a sacrifice ) the word godana is used in the sense of a portion 
of the hair ( on the head ) near the top of the ear. Most 
smrkikaras say that this samskara was performed in the 16th 
year. According to San. gr. ( I. 28. 20, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 57 ) 
ifc may be performed in the 16th or 18th year. According to 
Manu II. 65 kesanta is performed in the 16th, 22nd or 24tU 
year respectively for a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya. The 
Laghu-Asvalayana smrfci XIV. 1 says that Godana may be 
performed in the 16fch year or at the time of marriage. This 
last view seems to have been known to Bhavabhuti who in his 
UfcfcararSmacarita 96! ( Acfc. I) makes the heroine Slfca say that 
Rama and his three brothers had the godana ceremony per- 
formed immediately before their marriage. Ifc is somewhat 
strange that according to the Kausika sutra 962 ( 54. 15 ) 
godana precedes cudakarma and the commentator Kesava 
remarks that godana takes place at the end of the first or 2nd 
year ( from birth ). 

There is great divergence of views about the starting point 
from which 16 years are to be calculated. The Baud. Dh. S. 
( I. 2. 7 ) has stated the rule in general terms that the number 
of years is to be calculated from the time of conception. 963 
Following this rule the Mit. on Yaj. I. 36 and Kulluka on 
Man II. 65 say that godana should be performed in the 16th 
year from conception in the case of brahmanas, m while 
Apararka says that ifc is to be performed in the 16th year from 
birth. Visvarupa 965 on Yaj. I. 36 says that whatever the period 
of brahmacarya that a student was going to observe ( whether 
12, 24, 36, 48 &c. ) kesanta must be performed in the 16fch year 
and if any one had his upanayana performed later than the 
16fch year, then kesanta will not take place at all. Narayaija 
on 5.SV. gr. I. 22. 3 notes that according to some godana takes

place in the 16th year from upanayana, while others celebrate 
it in the 16th year from birth. 

A.11 Butrakaras are agreed that godana or kesanta follows 
the procedure of cudakarana with a few differences. The A&v. 
gr, ( 1. 18. 1-9 ) points these out. Caula is performed in the 
3rd year, while godana is performed in the 16th. Abv. gr. further 
says " wherever the word kesa occurs ( in the mantras or proce- 
dure of caula ) he should employ the word &ma6ru ( beard ). He 
moistens the beard here. (The mantra is) 'purify his head and face, 
but do not deprive him of life '. He gives orders ( to the barber ) 
'arrange his beard, the hair of his body and his nails, ending 
in the north'. Having bathed and stood up silently during 
the rest of the day, he should break his silence in the presence 
of his teacher (saying to the teacher) ' I give a gift \ The fee 
is a pair of cows. Let the teaoher instruct him to keep the 
observances for a year " 968 . Narayana notes that being grown 
up he should not sit on his mothers lap as in caula ( but sit to 
her right ) and that the instruction is to be on the next day. 
Narayana says that the instruction referred to is the one men- 
tioned in Asv. gr. I. 22. 20 from * cutting the hair ' to ' giving in 
charge ' i. e. from Asv. gr. I. 19. 8. to I. 20. 7. It is better to 
hold as Par. and Bhar. gr. ordain that the instruction is as to 
brahmacaryavrata ( mentioned m in AÂ£v. gr. I, 22. 17 ) or that 
he is not to shave himself for a year, 12 days, 6 days or at least 
3 days. Par. gr., Sankhayana and several others allowed the 
fee of only one cow M8 . Gobhila ( III. 1. 5 ) and Khadira 
( II. 5. 3 ) allowed optionally the gift of a pair of horses or a pair 
of sheep for ksatriyas or vaisyas respectively. According to

Ch. VII ] Reiclnta or Godana 405 

Gobhila and Khadira shaving the beard precedes a vrafca called 
godanika for one year and both state at length the observances 
of that vrata (Gobhila III. 1. 11-29, Khadira II. 5. 7-16 ). 

San. gr. ( I. 28. 22 ) expressly says that the kesanta ceremony 
is performed for girls but silently. Ap. gr. 16. 15, Hir. gr. 6. 16, 
Bharadvaja gr. I. 10, Baud. gr. III. 2. 55 prescribe in godana 
the removal of all the hair on the head ( including the sikha 
top-knot), while in caula it is not so. 

This samskara gradually went out of vogue, so much so that 
most of the medieval digests like the Sm. C, the Samskaraprakasa, 
and the Nirnayasindhu contain hardly anything about it. 

Snana or Samavartana: â (Taking the ceremonial bath 
after finishing Vedic study and returning from the teacher's 
house ). Some sutrakaras such as Gaut. ( VIII. 16 ), Ap. gr. 
XII. 1, Hir. gr. 9. 1 and Yaj. I. 51 employ the word 'snana' 
for this samskara, while Asv. gr. III. 8. 1, Baud, gr. ( II. 6. 1 ), 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 15 and 31, Bbar. gr. II. 18 employ the word 
samavartana. The Khadira gr. ( I. 3. 2-3, III. 1. 1 ) and 
Gobhila III. 4. 7 use the word ' aplavana ' ( which means 
snana ). Manu ( III. 4 ) uses both ' snana ' and ' samavartana ' 
in " a dvija being permitted by his teacher, may take the 
ceremonial bath and return from his teacher according to the 
rules laid down ( in his own grhyasutra ) and then marry a 
a girl &c ". Apararka (p. 76 ) explains this verse by saying 
that it makes a distinction between snana and samavartana. 
The distinction consists in this : snana or ceremonial bath 
indicates the completion of the period of student-hood, A man 
who wants to remain a brahmacarin all his life need not 
undergo this samskara. Samavartana literally means ' return 
from the teacher's house to one's home '. If a boy learns under 
his own father, then literally speaking there will be no return 
in his case from a teacher's house. Medhatithi 969 (on Manu III. 4) 
puts this position forcibly. Samavartana is not a necessary anga 
( adjunct ) of marriage and therefore he who learnt the Veda 
in his father's house may, though there is no return ( to the 
father's house from the teacher's house ), enter on matrimony. 
Some hold that Samavartana is an anga of marriage and consists

in the ceremonial bath. If it be said that the gerundial 
termination ( tva in snafcva in Manu III. 4 ) conveys distinction 
between snana and samavartana, the reply is that Manu will 
later on speak of samavartana as the samskara of snana. 

Ap. gr. 12. 1 begins its treatment with the words * vedani 
adhlfcya snasyan * ( after learning the Veda and when about 
to undergo the ceremonial bath )/ Having these words in mind 
Baud. gr. 970 (II 6. 1 ) remarks that in the words * vedam adhltya 
snasyan' it is samavartana that has been described. Hence 
the essence of samavartana is the ceremonial bath and return 
to the parental home is a subsidiary matter ( which may or 
may not occur in the case of a student). The Mahabbasya 
(vol. I. p. 384 ) says that a person after ho has studied the Veda 
and taken the ceremonial bath with the permission of the 
teacher should begin to use a cot (for sleeping on ). 

In the Vedic Literature both words are used. In the 
Chandogya Upanisad 971 IV. 10. 1 we read that Upakosala 
Kamalayana became a student of Satyak&ma Jabala and tended 
his teacher's fires for twelve years; the teacher while making his 
other pupils return ( to their parental home ) did not make Upako- 
sala return. Here it is clear that the Upanisad knew the term 
'samavartana*. Similarly in Chandogya VIII. 15 it is stated that 
' having studied the Veda according to the rules in the time that 
was left after doing work for the teacher and having returned 
from the teacher's house to his own family'. On the other 
hand the Sat. Br. (XI. 3. 3. 7 ) says ' that one m should not beg 
after taking the ceremonial bath '. The Sat. Br. ( XII. 1. 1. 10 ) 
distinguishes m a snataka from a brahmacarin ( S. B. E. vol. 
44 p. 137 ). Similarly the Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 13 quotes a Brah- 
mana passage ' therefore the face of the snataka is as if resplen- 
dent with fire'. The Ait. Ar. V. m 3. 3. remarks that ' one who

lias not studied this (malmvrata) does not become a (true) 
snataka, even though he may have learnt a good deal else.' 
The Asv. gr. III. 9. 8 summarises a Brahmana passage to the 
effect that a snataka is indeed a great being. 

Snana ( the ceremonial bath ) was ordained by the sutrakaras 
after a student finishesd his Vedic study. The Asv. gr. (III. 9. 4) 
remarks 4 after having finished (the task of learning) vidya, they 
should invite his teacher to name the gift ( of wealth or other- 
wise ) he desired or when the pupil has been permitted by 
the teacher, the pupil may take a ceremonial bath.* 975 This 
shows that one may perform snana either when he had finished 
his Vedic and other studies or he may do so even without 
finishing his intended studies, if the teacher permitted him to 
do so. The Far. gr. II. 6 is more explicit ' The student should 
take the ceremonial bath after finishing ( the study of ) the 
Veda or when he has gone through the period of student-hood 
for 48 years, or for 12 years according to some ( teachers ) ; 
( he should ) take the bath when permitted by the teacher.' A 
person who has taken the ceremonial bath is called a snataka. 
A snataka is said by the Par. gr. (II. 5), 976 Gobbila (III. 5. 21-22), 
Baud, gr paribhasa sutra I. 15, Harita and others to be of three 
kinds, viz vidyasnataka ( or Veda-snataka as Baud. gr. pari- 
bhasa has it ), vratasnataka and vidya-vratasnataka ( or veda- 
vrata-snataka as in Baud ). One who has finished Veda study, 
but has not gone through the vratas ( described above ) is called 
vidyasnataka ; one who has finished the vratas, but has not 
finished his Veda study is styled vratasnataka ; while one who 
has finished both is named vidya-vratasnataka. Yaj. I. 51 in 
saying that a student 'after finishing Veda (study) or the vratas 
( observances of brahmacarya ) or both, and after giving to 
the teacher what the latter chooses to ask should take the 
ceremonial bath with the teacher's permission ' impliedly refers 
to the three-fold division of snatakas. These three alternatives 
are due to the fact that a student may not have the ability or 
the time to go through the full Vedic curriculum and the

vratas. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 31 notices that according to 
some vrata-snatakas are those who without finishing Veda study- 
take the ceremonial bath three years after upanayana. Gobhila 
( III. 5. 23 ) says that of these, vidya-vrata-snataka is the best, 
the other two being equal to each other. Ap. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 
1-5 ) refers to this three-fold division and adds that all three 
are to be honoured as snatakas, but that great reward follows 
by honouring vidyS-vrata-snatakas. 

A good deal of time may conceivably elapse between a 
man's taking the ceremonial bath and actually marrying a 
woman. During that period he is called a snataka; while after 
marriage he comes to be called a grhastha 977 . As long as a 
person is not married after he takes the bath, he has to follow 
the observances prescribed for snatakas and grhasthas so far as 
applicable to his position but not those of a student. Gaut. m 
( IX. 1-2 ) makes the position quite clear by prescribing the 
same rules of conduct for grhasthas and for snatakas. He also 
states ( in III. 9 ) that whatever rules laid down for brahma- 
carins are not opposed to the special rules for other asramas are 
to be observed by all. The latter means that the special obser- 
vances of a brahmacarl are not applicable to him (such as 
avoiding honey and flesh, living on aims, offering fuel-sfcicks 
to fire ). 

The most elaborate procedure of samavartana is found in 
Hir. gr. I. 9-13, Baud. gr. paribhasa I. 14, Par. gr. II. 6 and 
Gobhila gr. III. 4-5. A concise statement is given below from 
Asv. gr. ( III. 8 and 9 ). The student who is about to return home 
from his teacher should get ready (eleven) things, viz. a jewel 
(to be suspended round his neck ), two ear-rings, a pair of gar- 
ments, an umbrella, a pair of shoes, a staff, a wreath, (powder) 
for rubbing his body with, ointment, eye-salve, a turban, ( all 
these ) being meant for the teacher and for himself. If he 
cannot afford to have these materials for both of them, then he

should prepare them only for the teacher. He should procure a 
fuel-stick from the north-east side of a sacrificial tree ( like 
palasa ) ; the f uel-stick may be undried if he wishes for the 
enjoyment of food or for prosperity or for splendour; it may be 
dry if he wishes for spiritual lustre ; or both dry ( in part ) 
and undried in the remaining part if he desires both. Having 
placed the fuel-stick on high ( not on the ground ) and having 
made gifts of food and of a cow to brahmanas, he should perform 
the actions prescribed in godana ceremony ( and not the obser- 
vances like remaining silent ). He should 97d alter the mantras 
( of godana ) so that they refer to himself. ( He should rub 
himself) with the powder of Ekaklltaka. 980 Having bathed 
himself in lukewarm water and having put on two garments 
which have not yet been washed ( or used ) with the mantra 
' You two ( Mitra and Varuna ) put on garments 981 with fat

with the words ' thou art the lustre of stone, protect my eye.' 
He should fasten the two ear-rings with the words * thou art 
the lusfcre of stone ; protect my ear.' After having smeared his 
two hands with ointment ( saffron paste &c.) a brahmana should 
first anoint his face with it ( and then the limbs ), a Rajanya 
his two arms first, a vaisya his belly first, a woman her private 
parts, persons, who maintain themselves by running, their 
thighs. With the words ' free from distress art thou, may 
I become free from distress ' he should put on the wreath, but 
not such a wreath as would be called a mala ( garland ). 
If some call it mala (through ignorance of what to say) 
he should cause them to speak of it as sraj ( wreath ). He 
steps into the shoes with the words ' you two are the supports 
of the gods, protect me from all sides ' and with the

words 'heaven's covering art thou 1 he takes the umbrella. 
He takes the bamboo staff with the words * bamboo art 
thou, thou art the child of a tree, protect me from all sides.' 
Having tied round his neck the jewel 988 with the hymn 
beginning with ' ftyusyam \ m and having arranged the 
turban ( on his head ) he should in a standing posture 
put a fuel-stiok ( on the fire ), and should say at that time 
4 memory and reproach, knowledge, faith, wisdom as the fifth, 
what is sacrificed, what is given (as gift), what is studied 
and what is done, truth, learning, observances. O Agni, the 
vow (of thee) together with Indra, with Prajapati, with the 
sages, with the sages that are ksatriyas, with the Fathers, with 
the kings among Fathers, with men and with the kings among 
men, with the glow, with the super-glow, with the after-glow, 
with the counter-glow, with gods and men, with Gandharvas 
and Apsarases, with wild and domestic animals, the vow be- 
longing to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my 
entire vow. O Agni I I shall on all sides becoma this vow, 
svaha*. With the hymn 'mine, O Agni, bo the glory ' ( Rg. X. 
128. 1 ) he should put fuel-sticks on fire one for each verse. m 
He should stay for the night at a place where the people will 
do honour to him ( by offering Madhuparka )\ Madhuparka 
will be dealt with under marriage. 

The Baud. gr. paribhasa says (1. 14. 1) that the samavartana 
rite for him who is only a vratasnataka ( and has not studied 
the Veda ) is performed silently ( i. ,e. without the mantras 
prescribed ). The other grhya sutras have a similar procedure 
in samavartana, only the mantras sometimes differ and a few 
details are added. 

982. NSrayana on -Siv. gr. I. 8. 16 says that the 'raani ' is 'auvar- 
namaya (made of gold). Ap. gr. 12. 8 speaks of 'maniih sauvarriam 
sopadhanam ' (a golden bead with two precious stones on two sides ). 

983. This sGkta is a khila snkta in the Rgveda. It occurs in the 
3TFT. *T. qrf- II. 8. It is in praise of gold. 

984. NSrayana adds on 2fc$v. gr. III. 8. 16 that he should keep aside 
his Bhoes and then offer the fuel-stick. Stenzler conjectures 3t1t; for a*$r 
in 3nÂ«*. ^. III. 9. 1, which is unwarranted and unnecessary. The sUkta 
%. X. 128 has nine verses. NSrSyaaa says that there is to be homa 
with ten samidhs ; the tenth verse, therefore, is the verse c 5yuf yam ' 
which is the first verse of the KhilaeOkta after %. X. 128. The erstwhile 
â tudent is to offer tamidht sitting and not standing and end the rite with 
the offering to Sviftakit Agni. 



Ch, VII ] Procedure of Samavartana 411 

For example, San. gr. ( III. 1. % ) makes the student sit on 
bull's hide. Par. gr. ( II. 6 ) prescribes that eight jars full of 
water are to be placed on ku6a grass and water therefrom is 
to be poured over the head and the body of the student with 
certain mantras, that he is to worship the rising sun, to par- 
take of curds or sesame seeds, to cleanse his teeth with an 
udumbara twig, he sees himself in a mirror ( after adorning 
himself ). Both Par. and Gobhila ( III. 4. 23 ) say that in this 
rite the girdle is taken off. Gobhila ( Ilf. 4. 31-34 ) says that 
at the end of the rite the student should mount a chariot 
drawn by oxen, drive some distance in an eastern or northern 
direction, should then come back to the teacher who honours 
him with madhuparka. Hir. gr. ( I. 9. 10) says that the girdle, 
the staff and the black antelope skin that he wore as brahma- 
carin are to be thrown into water. The Laghu-A&valayana- 
smrti ( 14fch section ) appears to suggest that godana and sama- 
vartana take place on the same day and that at the end of the 
horn a in samavartana a student of the Rgveda should unloosen 
the girdle of munja grass with the mantra ' ud uttamam 
mumugdhi ' ( Rg. I. 25. 21 ). It is for this reason that in the 
Maratha country samavartana is called ' sodmufija ' ( rite in 
which the munja girdle is taken away ). 

The sutras more or less prescribe expressly or impliedly 
the same materials that are required by Asvalayana. Vide 
Bhar. gr. II. 18 ( which enumerates them in one place ), Baud, 
gr. paribhasa sutra I. 13. 1. 

Some of the sutras specify the auspicious times when this 
rite is to be performed. Hir. gr, I. 9. 3 lays down that the 
proper time for snana is during the northern course of the sun, 
in the bright half of a month when the moon is in conjunction 
with RohinI, Mrgasiras, Tisya ( Pusya ), Uttara" PhalgunI, 
Hasta, Citra, or ViSakha. The Baud. gr. paribhasa ( L 13. 3-9 ) 
omits Mrgasiras out of these, while Bhar, gr. ( II. 18 ) omits 
RohinI and Mrgasiras and adds Svati. Medieval and modern 
digests add elaborate rules about the astrological details for 
the proper day of samavartana, which are passed over here. 
Vide Sarhskaraprakasa pp. 576-578 for some of these details. 

Numerous rules are laid down in the smrtis and digests 
about snatakas ( snatakadharmah ). Many of these rules are 
applicable to grhasthas also ( i. e. snatakas who have married ). 
Those rules are too numerous to enumerate. But some idea 
may be cpnveyed by quoting in full the rules in 5iv. gr f

( III. 9. 6-7 ) which has the shortest treatment and adding a 
few interesting items from other works. Asv. gr. ( III. 9. 6-7 ) 
says 4 He ( the snataka ) should not bathe at night, nor 
bathe naked, nor lie down naked, he should not look at a 
naked woman except during intercourse, he shall not run 
when it rains, he should not climb up a tree, nor descend into a 
well, should not cross a river ( by swimming) with his arms, he 
should not expose himself to a danger. A great being indeed is 
a snataka â so it is known (from the 6ruti)\ Ap. Dh. S. (1. 11. 
30. 6-1. 11. 32. 29), Vas. XII. 1-47, Gaut. IX, Yaj. 1, 129-166, 
Manu IV. 13ff, Visnu Dh. S. 71, Par. gr. II. 1 contain an exhaus- 
tive treatment of snataka vratas. Some of these are concerned 
with the rules about anadhyayas, about answering calls of 
nature, about persons whose food should not be taken, about 
sexual intercourse, about acamana, about daily observances 
like the five mahayajnas, about upakarma and utsarjana. These 
have been or will be dealt with in the appropriate places. A 
few of the other important rules of conduct are : a snataka 
should always be pure (in body), should daily bathe and 
should apply fragrant unguents (like sandal-wood paste) to 
his body, should be always patient, persistent in his under- 
takings, self-restrained, generous and not disposed to cause 
injury to others ( Gaut. 9. 7 and 73 ); he should speak the truth 
and also speak what is agreeable, but should not tell disagree- 
able truths, nor should he tell agreeable lies ( Manu IV. 138 
and Gaut. IX. 68 ) ; he should' according to his ability try to 
make his day fruitful as regards the performance of meritorious 
acts, satisfaction of ( legitimate ) desires and acquisition of 
wealth, but he should look upon dharma as the principal of 
the three purusarthas ( Gaut. IX. 46-47, Manu IV. 176, Yaj. I. 
156), though he should avoid even what is allowed by the 6as- 
tras if it is hateful to the people ; he should not beg (for his liveli- 
hood ) of anybody except the king or his pupils, but when oppres- 
sed by hunger he may beg a little such as a cultivated or uncul- 
tivated field, a cow, goats and sheep, or gold, corn, food (Vas. 
XII. 2-3, Gaut. IX 63-64, Manu IV. 33-34, Yaj. 1. 130); but he 
should not beg of a king who is not of ksatriya descent or who 
sets at naught the dictates of the sastras ( Manu IV. 84, 87) nor 
should he stay in the kingdom of a sudra king (Manu IV. 61) ; he 
should not talk with the mlecchas, impure persons and irreligious 
persons ( Gaut. IX. 17 ) ; he should not dwell in contact with 
sinners, candalas and other untouchables, with fools or persons 
puffed up with the pride of wealth &c, (Manu IV. 79) ; he should 



Clh. VII ] Snataka-dharma 413 

not be restless in his sexual desires or with his hands and 
feet, speech and eyes ( Gaut, IX. 50, Manu IV. 177, Vas. VI. 42 ) ; 
he should go round ( perform pradaksina ), when he meets on 
his way a cow, images of gods, a brahmana, ghee, honey, a 
square, well-known trees (Manu IV. 39, Gaut. IX. 66); he 
should not engage in wordy quarrels with his parents, guests, 
brothers, sisters, persons connected by mairiage, maternal 
uncles, dependents, relations, sacrificial and family priests, 
children, wife, slaves (Manu IV. 179-180 =Santiparva 244, 
14-16, Yaj. I. 157-158 ) ; he should carry a bamboo stick, a 
water jar, kuSa grass, wear two yajiiopavltas, two garments 
(upper and lower) and two golden ear-rings ( Manu IV. 36, 
Yaj. 1. 133, Vas. XII. 14, 37-38 ) ; if he has money enough he 
should not wear old and dirty clothes, his garments should be 
white, he should not wear garments that are dyed and black 
cloth even when that is its natural colour ( Ap. Dh. S. 1. 11. 
30, 10-13, Manu IV. 34-35, Yaj. I. 131, Gaut. IX. 4-5 ) nor 
should he wear the clothes, shoes, and garland of another and 
if he wears these of another owing to poverty, he should 
thoroughly clean them ( Gaut. IX. 6-7, Manu IV. 66) ; he should 
not allow his beard to grow unless there is some good ground 
to do so and should pare his nails ( Gaut. IX. 8, Manu V. 35, 
Yaj. 1. 131); while his shoes are in his hand he should not sit on 
a seat nor should he salute a person or bow to a deity ( Gaut. 
IX. 45 ) ; he should not blow with his mouth to kindle fire 
( Manu IV. 53, Vas. XII. 27, Gaut. IX. 32 ) ; he should not hold 
simultaneously in his hands fire and water nor should ho come 
between the fire and a brahmana nor between two brahmanas 
without their permission (Ap. Dh. S. II. 5.12.6-8, Vas. XII. 28-30); 
he should not eat food in the same plate with his wife, nor 
should he see his wife while she is eating or applying eye-salve 
or when she is yawning or sneezing (Manu IV. 43-44, Vas. XII. 31, 
Gaut. IX 32 ) ; he should not use a seat or padukas or tooth- 
brush made of palasia ( Vas. XII. 34, Gaut. IX. 44, Ap. Dh. 
S. I. 11. 32. 9 ) ; he should wear a wreath ( of flowers ) and 
ointment so as not to be easily noticed ( Ap. Dh. S. 1. 11. 32. 5, 
Manu IV. 72, Vas. 12. 39, Gaut. IX. 32); he should not see 
the sun rising or setting ( Vas. 12. 10, Manu IV. 39, Ap. Dh. S. 
1. 11. 31. 20 ) ; he should not be kularhkula m and should not

go over a rope by which a calf is tied ( Vas. XII. 8-9, Gaut. 
IX. 52-53, Manu IV. 38); he is not to point out the rainbow 
to another when he sees it in the sky ( Manu IV. 59 ) nor is 
he to employ the word * Indradhanuh ' for it, but the word 
1 manidhanuh ' ( Vas. XII. 32-33. Gaut. IX. 23, Ap. Dh. S. 
1. 11. 31, 18 ) ; he is to employ certain euphemisms e. g. he should 
not speak of a cow that yields no milk as * adhenu ' but as 
1 dhenu-bhavya ' ( who would become dhenu later on ), he is 
not fco employ the word $ bhadra ' for a thing that is auspicious, 
but he should employ the words ' punya or prasasta '; what is 
not * bhadra ' he should speak of as ' bhadra ' and should not 
use the word ' kapala \ but the word ' bhagala ' for it ( Gaut, 
IX. 20-22, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 11. 31. 11-14 ) ; he should not inform 
a person when a cow does some damage or allows her calf 
to have milk without the owner knowing it (Ap. Dh. S, I. 
11. 31. 9-10, Gaut. IX. 24-25); he should enter or leave his 
village from the east or north (Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 7; and 
should not enter a village or a guarded house by a by-path 
(Manu IV. 73, Yaj. I. 140, Ap. Db. S. I. 11. 32. 23); 
at the two twilights he should be seated outside the village 
and should be silent ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 11, 30. 8 ) ; he should not 
wander about by day with the head covered, but he may do 
so at night or when answering calls of nature (Gaut. IX. 35-37 ; 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 14 ) ; he should avoid finding fault with a 
cow, a fee given or a maiden ( Ap. Dh. S. L 11. 31. 8 ) ; 
he should not resort 988 to inferior men or to countries in which 
such persons abound nor should he frequent gambling houses 
or meetings of clubs (Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 32. 18-20, Vas. XII. 40 ); 
he should try to dwell in a place that abounds in fuel, water 
and grass, kusas, flowers, that has a court-yard, and is mostly 
peopled by Aryas, that has industrious and religious people 
( Gaut. IX. 65 ); he should take his food, answer calls of nature,

engage in dalliance with his wife, engage 987 in yoga practical 
in a place screened from public view and he should guard his 
speech, intellect and strength and should keep his wealth and 
age very secret ; but he should make public the repayment of a 
debt, a gift, mortgage or sale, the gift of his daughter in 
marriage, the letting loose of a bull (in sr&ddha) and a sin 
done in secret. 

Manu (XL 203 ) says that the prayascitta for not observing 
the rules of conduct laid down for snatakas is fasting for a day. 
Haradatta on Gautama IX. 2 says that the rules for snatakas 
are meant for brShmana and ksatriya snatakas only, that the 
prayascitta for non-observance is also to be undergone by them 
and that the vaisya snatakas are not obliged to observe these 
rules. 

In modern times samavartana often takes place a short 
time after upanayana and sometimes on the 4th day thereafter 
or even the next day. As many br&hmanas do nob learn any 
part of the Veda, samavartana has become a mere matter of 
form in their case. Even the Samskarakaustubba (p. 607) 
prescribes a very brief procedure for samavartana when the 
brahmacarl is ill. It consists in the brahmacarl giving up his 
girdle &câ in shaving the boy silently, in silently bathing at a 
holy place, putting on another garment, then sipping water 
twice, bringing fire from the house of a srotriya and placing it 
on some place according to the rules, then contemplating on 
Prajapati and putting the samidh (fuel-stick) on fire. 

As a brahmacarl is not affected by the mourning due to the 
death of relatives (except his parents), on samavartana he has 
to observe impurity for three days (if there have been deaths of 
relatives in the interval, but not for births ). GVide Manu V. 
88=VisnuDh. S. 22. 87).

CHAPTER VIII 

ASRAMAS 

In the preceding pages several questions connected with 
brahmacarya have been dealt with. Brahmacarya is, according 
to the theory of the dharmasutras and smrtis, the first of the 
four asramas. Therefore, before proceeding to the next sarhskara, 
viz. vivaha ( marriage ) which is the starting point of the 
second asrama, it is necessary to discuss the origin and deve- 
lopment of the idea of asramas. 

// From the times of the most ancient dharmasutras the 
number of asramas has been four, though there are slight 
differences in the nomenclature and in their sequence. 988 Ap. Dh. 
S. II. 9.21. 1 says 'there are four asramas, viz. the stage of 
householder, ( staying in ) the teacher's house, stage of being 
a mwni % the stage of being a forest dweller.' That here maum 
stands for the asrama of safiinyasa is clear from Apastamba's 
own words in II. 9. 21. 7 ( atha parivrajah ) where he employs 
the word * parivraj ' to indicate 4 mauna.' Ap. places the house- 
holder first among the asramas, probably on account of the 
importance of that stage to all other asramas. Why he should 
mention the stage of forest hermit last is not clear. ( Gaut. also 
( III. 2 ) enumerates the four asramas as brahmacarl, grhastha, 
bhiksu and vaikhanasa. Here also Gaut. speaks of bhiksu before 
vaikhanasa and Haradatta 989 explains this departure from the 
usual sequence of asramas as due to the words in Gaut. 28. 47 
where we read'prag-uttamadtraya asraminaV (persons belonging 
to the three asramas except the last may constitute a parisad ), 
i.e. to exclude vaikhanasa from the parisad he is mentioned last. 
Why.the vanaprastha is called vaikhanasa will be discussed later 
on under the former word. * Vas. Dh. S. (VII. 1-2) names the four 
asramas as brahmacarl, grhastha, vanaprastha and parivrajaka.

Uli. VIII ] Asramas 417 

Vas. Dh. S. (in XL 34) employs the word ijati to denote a person 
in the fourth asrama. Baud. Dh. S. (II. 6. 1?) names the four asra- 
mas in the same way as Vasistha and vouchsafes the interesting 
information that it was the asura Kapila, son of Prahlada, 
who in his rivalry with the gods, made these distinctions to 
which a wise man should pay no heed. What Baud. 990 means 
appears to be that there is really one asrama viz. that of the 
householder, that Kapila devised the scheme of four asramas, 
so that those who became vanaprastbas and parivrajakas would 
perform no yajfias and thereby the gods would lose the offer- 
ings they received from men and become less powerful. Manu 
VI. 87 speaks of the four asmmas, the last being called yati by 
him and also ' samnyasa * ( in VI. 96 ). It would thus be seen 
that a person who belongs to the last asrama is variously 
called parivrat or parivrajaka ( one who does not stay in one 
place but wanders from place to place ), bhiksu ( one who 
begs for his livelihood ), muni ( one who ponders over the 
mysteries of life and death ), ijati ( one who controls his senses ) 
These words suggest the various characteristics of the man who 
undertakes the fourth asrama. 

The theory of Manu about these asramas is as follows. 
The span of human life is one hundred years ( sat&yur vai 
purusah ). All do not live to that age, but that is the maximum 
age one can expect to reach. This should be divided into four 
parts. As one cannot know beforehand what age one is going 
to reach, it is not to be supposed that these four parts are each 
of 25 years. They may be more or less. As stated in Manu 
IV, 1 the first part of man's life is brahmacarya in which he 
learns at his teacher's house and after he has finished his study, 
in the second part of his life he marries and becomes an house- 
holder, discharges his debts to his ancestors by begetting 
sons and to the gods by performing yajfias ( Manu V. 169 ). 
When he sees that his head has grey hair and that there are 
wrinkles on his body he resorts to the forest i. e. becomes a 
vftnaprastha ( Manu VI. 1-2 ). After spending the third part 
of his life in the forest for some time he spends the rest of his 
life as a samnyasin 991 (Manu VI. 33). Similar rules are found

in many other smrtis. m Baud. ( Dh. S. II. 10. 5 ) m states as 
his own opinion that the sages prescribe sarhnyasa after 
the 70th year. 

The word asrama does not occur in the Sarhhit&s or Brah- 
manas. But this cannot be stretched to mean that the stages of 
life denoted by this word in the sutras were unknown throughout 
the Vedic period. It has been shown above (p. 268) that the word 
brahmacarl occurs in the Rgveda and the Atharvaveda and that 
brahmacarya is mentioned in the Tai. S., the Sat. Br. and other 
ancient Vedic works. So the stage of brahmacarya was well- 
known in the remotest past. The fact that Agni is said to bo 
* the grhapati in our house * ( Rg. II. 1. 2 ) "* and the fact that 
in the famous verse ( Rg. X. 85. 36 ) which is employed even to- 
day in the marriage ceremony the husband says to the bride 
when taking hold of her hand that the gods gave her to him for 
garhapatya (for attaining the position of a house-owner or 
householder) establish that the second stage of the householder 
was well-known to the Rgveda, There is nothing in the Vedic 
Literature expressly corresponding to the vanaprastha. It may 
however be stated that the Tandya MahabrShmana 14. 4. 7 says 
that vaikhSnasa sages were the favourites of Indra and 
that one Rahasya Devamalimluc killed them in a place called 
Munimarana. Vaikhanasa means * vfinaprastha * in the sutras 
and it is possible that this is the germ of the idea of vana- 
prastha. ' Yati ' used in the sutras and smrtis to indicate the 
fourth asrama of samnyasa does occur in the oldest Vedic

Rg. the word ' yati ' occurs several times. But the sense is 
doubtful. Rg. VIII. 3. 9 runs * whereby m when wealth was bes- 
towed on Bhrgu and on yatis ( or ' on Bhrgu from yatis *) you pro- 
tected Praskanva \ Rg. VIII. 6. 18 reads * Indra, the yatis and

when you filled the worlds as the yatis ( did ) you brought the sun 
hidden in the sea \ In the Tai. 998 S. VI. 2. 7. 5 we read 'Indra threw 
yatis to the salavrkas ( hyaenas or wolves), they devoured them 
to the south of the Uttaravedi.' The same words and story 
occur in the Kathaka saihhita VIII. 5, the Ait. Br. 35. 2 (pradat) 
and the Kausltaki Up. III. 1; in the last Indra said to Pratardana 
* do know me only ; I regard this as the most beneficial thing 
to man that he should know me. I killed the three-headed 
Tvastra, I gave to the salavrkas the Arunmukha yatis.* In 
the Kathaka saihhita ( IV. 10 ) and the Tai. S. II. 4, 9. 2 it is 
stated that the heads of the yatis when they were being devoured 
fell aside and they (the heads) became the kharjuras (date 
palms ). Atharvaveda II. 5. 3. says ' Indra, who is quick in his 
attack, who is Mitra and who killed Vrtra as he did the yatis.' 
In the Tandya Mahabrahmana VIII. 1. 4 Brhadgiri is said 
to be one of the three yatis who escaped from slaughter and 
who were then taken under his protection by Indra. All these 
passages taken together suggest that the yatis were people who 
had incurred the hostility of Indra, the patron of the Aryas, 
that they were slaughtered by the Aryas with the help of Indra 
and their bodies were thrown to the wolves and that they seem 
to have something to do with a country where the date-palm 
grew and that a few of them who escaped slaughter subse- 
quently were won over and became the worshippers of Indra 
( and therefore in Rg. VIII. 6. 18 they are described as praising 
Indra ). So originally they were probably beyond the pale of 
the Vedic Aryans. If there is any connection between yati 
and yatu ( sorcery ) which seems possible, the yatis were pro- 
bably non-vedic sorcerers. 

In the Rg. X, 136. 2, thore is a reference 9 * 7 to munis, who are 
wind-girt and who put on brownish dirt (dirty garments). In Xlg t 
VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be the friend of munis ( Indro muni- 
nam sakha)and in ftg. X.136. 4 muni is said to be the friend of 
all gods. So it appears that even in the times of the Rgveda persons

who led a life of poverty, contemplation and mortification were 
known, and were honoured and called munis, while persons 
corresponding to them among non-vedic people were probably 
called yatis. But in both these words there is no idea of a 
certain stage in a well-knit scheme of life. Perhaps the earliest 
reference to the four asramas, though somewhat obscure* 
occurs in the Ait. Br. 33. 11 'what (use is there) of dirt, 
what use of antelope skin, what use of ( growing ) the beard, 
what is the use of tapas ? O ! brahmanas ! desire a son, he is a 
world that is to be highly praised.' 998 Here it is clear that ajina 
refers to brahmacarya, smasruni to yanaprasthas ( since accord- 
ing to Manu VI. 6 and Gaut. III. 33T the vanaprastha hadto grow 
his hair, beard and nails ).) Therefore * malam^and 'tapas' 
must be taken respectively as indicating the householder and the 
eamnyasin. A much clearer reference to three asramas occurs 
in the Chandogya M * Up. II. 23. 1 ' there are three branches of 
dharma, the first ( is constituted by ) sacrifice, study and 
charity ( i. e. by the stage of householder ), the second is 
(constituted by the performance of) tapas (iÂ« e. the vanaprastha), 
the third is the brahmacar! staying in the house of his teacher 
and wearing himself out till death in the teacher's house; 
all these attain to the worlds of the meritorious ; but one who 
( has correctly understood brahma ) and abides in it attains 
immortality \ Tapas is a characteristic of both vanaprastha 
and parivrajaka. Therefore in this paesage it is possible to 
hold that the three asramas ( of student, householder and vana- 
prastha ) are mentioned. The last clause about 'brahmasarhstha* 
differentiates the three asramas from him who has knowledge

meant. This passage of the Chan. Up. is the basis of VedSntasOtra

of brahma and holds fast by id. That portion says that the 
consequence of the knowledge of brahma is im mortality ; 
but it does not say expressly or impliedly that the 
stage of parivrajaka is a means of attaining the knowledge 
of brahma. So one may doubt whether samnyasa as 
an asrama is spoken of here, but there can be no doubt 
that the other three are clearly indicated here. Probably in the 
time of the Chandogya there was no clear line of demarcation 
between the asramas of vanapraslha and samnyasa and they 
rather coalesced into each other.) Chan. Up. V. 10. 1 and Br. 
Up. VI. 2. 15 support this conclusion 1000 . In the Br. Up. III. 5. 1 
there is a reference to brahmanas who on apprehending correct- 
ly the Supreme Spirit turn away from the desires of progeny, 
wealth and of securing holy worlds and practise begging. 
Begging is a characteristic of samnyasa in the sutras. Yajna- 
valFya in the Br. Up. IV. 5. 2. tells his wife Maitreyl that he 
was going into a life of pravrajya from being a householder. 
MundakaTTpTl. X 11 refers to begging for him who has know- 
ledge of brahma and Mundaka III. 2. 6 mentions ' samnyasa \ 
In the Jftbalopanisad 1001 (4) it is said that Janaka asked Yajiia- 
valkya to expound samnyasa and then the four asramas are 
distinctly set out * after finishing the stage of student-hood, one 
should become a householder ; after becoming a householder 
one should become a forest-dweller, after being a forest-dweller, 
one should renounce the world ; or he may do otherwise viz. 
he may renounce the world after the stage of student-hood itself 
or after being an householder or from the forest. ( The very day 
on which he becomes desireless, he should renounoe the world 
( become a samnyasin ) \ Probably this passage 1002 was not

before the author of the Vedantasutra or he did not regard 
the Jabalopanisad as very authoritative ; otherwise there 
would hardly have been any need for the VedSntasutrakara 
( in the Vedantasutra III. 4. 18-20 ) to hold a discussion on 
Chandogya II. 23. 1. 

It is clear thet in the times of the earliest Upanisads at 
least three (if not four) asramas were known and that all 
four were known by their specific names to the Jabalopanisad. 
Jn the Svetasvataropanisad (VI. 21) wo have the word 
' atyasraraibhyah \ It is said there that the sage Svetasvatara, 
who acquired knowledge of Brahma, proclaimed the knowledge 
to those who had risen above the mere observances of asramas. 

No scholar Eastern or Western places Panini later than 
300 B. C. He knew Bhiksu-sutras composed by Parasarya and 
Karmanda 1003 and he tells us that the word ' maskarin n004 
means parivrajaka. As sutra works about 'bhiksus' were 
composed before Panini, this asrama of bhiksus must have 
been an established institution centuries before Panini. 
Buddhism took over this mode of life (pabbajja as the Pali 
works say ) from the brahmanical system. 

* It has been already stated at p. 8 that the goals of existence 
werejeemed to be four, viz. dharuia, artha, kamaand raoksa. The 
highest goal was mokqa. All ancient" Indian philosophy 
(whether Vedanta, Sarhkhya or Nyaya) held that liberation from 
the never-ending cycle of births and deaths, and escape from 
the three kinds of duhkha were the highest good. The summum 
bonum consisted in non-return ( anavrfctih ) to the world of 
pleasures and sorrows. The Chan. Up. 1005 VII I. 15. 1 winds 
up with the words 'and he does not return'. The Br. Up. 
VI. 2. 15, Prasna Up. I. 10 and others say the same. This 
supreme goal had fascinated all noble minds in whatever 
sphere of life they might have been working. The greatest 
poet and dramatist of classical Sanskrit ends his most famous 
drama ( the $akuntala ) with the prayer 4 may self-existent God 
Siva destroy for me rebirth \ 1006 This state of liberation or 
release is variously called moksa or mukti, amrtatva, nihsreyasa,

kaivalya ( by the SSrhkhyas ) or apavarga ( Nyayasutra I. 1. 2 ). 
For attaining this state man must know and realize that there 
Is only one ReaTify underlying all existence (and no plurality ) 
and become disgusted with the passions and temptations of the 
world i. e. he must have nirveda and vairagya ( as stated in the 
Br. Up. III. 5. 1 or Mundaka I. 2. 12 ), Merely reading from 
the books that desirelessness is necessary for release and 
immediately giving up the world would not serve the purpose. 
(The man would be hankering, as the Bhagavadglta says, after 
pleasures" he has renounced. Therefore the anoient Indian 
writers devised according fcf their lights a scheme which is 
embodied in the theory and practice of the asramas. In brahma- 
carya the individual goes through the discipline of the will 
and the emotions, makes himself acquainted with the literary 
treasures of the past and learns obedience, respect, plain living 
and high thinking. " Then he marries, becomes a householder, 
tastes the pleasures of the world, enjoys life, has sons, dis- 
charges ins duties to his children, to his friends, relatives and 
neighbours and becomes a useful, industrious and worthy 
citizen, the founder of a family. It is supposed that by the 
time he is fifty years or so he has become convinced of the 
futility of human appetites and the pleasures of the world and 
is, therefore, called upon to resort to a forest life for pondering 
over the great problem of the life hereafter and to accustom 
himself to self-abnegation, austerities and a harmless life. 
This would lead on to the last stage, viz. samnyasa. He may 
succeed in this very life in realizing the supreme goal of 
moksa or he may have to continue to rise in spiritual height 
until after several births and deaths the goal is in view. The 
theory of varna dealt with man as a member of the Aryan 
society and laid down what his rights, functions, privileges, 
responsibilities and duties were as a member of that society. 
It was addressed to man in the mass/ The theory of asramas 
addressed itself to the individual. It texts Him what his spiri- 
tual goal is, how he is to order his life and what preparations 
are required to attain that goal. The theory of asramas was 
truly a sublime conception and if owing to the exigencies of 
the times, the conflicts of interests and distractions of life, the 
scheme could not even in ancient times be carried out fully by 
every individual and seems to have failed in modern times, 
the fault does not lie with the originators of this conception. 
Deussen was constrained to say ( in E. R. E. under asrarna ) 
' how far the praofcice corresponded to this theory given in 



424 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. VIII 

Manu and other law books, we do not know; but we are free 
to confess that in our opinion the whole history of mankind has 
not much that equals the grandeur of this thought * and again 
iu 'The Philosophy of the Upanisads' (tr. by Geden, 1906 ) 
p. 3G7 * the entire history of mankind does not produce much 
that approaches in grandeur to this thought \ 

s The three asramas of householder, forest hermit and sam- 
nyasa will be dealt with in detail hereafter. Only one question 
about asramas in general remains to be discussed. With refe- 
rence to the four asramas, there" are "three different points of 
view(paksas) viz. samuccayaj, orderly co-ordination), vikalpa 
(option) and badlia( annulment or contradiction). Those who 
hold the first view (samuccaya) say that a person can resort to 
the four asramas one after another in order and that he cannot 
drop any one or more and pass on to the next nor can he resort 
to the householder's life after becoming a samnyasin (vide 
Daksa J. 8-9, Vedantasutra III. 4. 40) e. g. a man cannot take 
samnyasa immediately after brahmacarya. Manu (IV. 1, VI. 1. 
33-37,87-88) is the prime supporter of this view. The first 
part of the Jabalopanisad quoted above refers to this view. 
This view does not regard marriage and sexual life as impure 
or inferior to asceticism and on the contrary places it on a 
higher plane than asceticism. On the whole the tendency of 
most of the dharmasastra works is to glorify the status of an 
house-holder and push into the background the two asramas of 
vanapraslha and samnyasa, so much so that certain works say 
that these are forbidden in the Kali age, v The second view is 
that there is an option after brahmacarya i. e." aTman may be- 
come a pariirujaka immediately after he finishes his study or 
immediately after the householder's way of life- This view is 
put forward by the Jabalopanisad as an alternative to the first 
view of samuccaya. This is the view also of Vasistha VII. 3, 
Laghu Visnu III. 1, and Yaj. III. 56. Ap. Dh. S._(II. 9. 21. 7-8 
and II. 9. 22. 7-8) seems to favour this view. The third view 
of badha is held by the ancient dharmasutras oTGautama ,007 
and Baudhayana. They 1 hold that there is really one asrama 
viz. that of the householder ( brahmacarya beiiig only prepara- 
tory to it ) and that the other asramas are inferior to that of the 
householder. Vide Gautama ( III. 1 and 35 ) where he first

A III. 1 and 35. 



Oh. VIII ] Mramas 425 

refers to the view about vikalpa (option) and emphatically says 
that there is only one a&rama. Manu VI. 89-90, III. 77-80, 
Vas. Dh. S. VIII. 14-17, Daksa II. 57-60, Visnu Dh. S. 59. 29 
and many others praise the asrama of householder as the highest. 
Baud. Dh. S. (II. 6. 29 ff) Bays the same as Gautama and it 
relies 1008 upon the fact that the aSramas other than that of 
householder do not beget offspring and quotes Vedic passages 
viz. 'may we, O Agni, attain immortality through progeny' 
(#g. V. 4. 10=Tai. S. I. 4. 46. 1) and * a brahmana when born 
is born involved in three debts, viz. he owes brahmacarya to the 
sages, sacrifice to the gods, and progeny to pitrs' (Tai. S. VI. 
3. 10. 5). According to Brahmasutra III. 4. 18 Jaimini held 
this view, while Badarayana seems to have been of the opinion 
that all a&ramas are enjoined ( ibid. III. 4. 19-20 ). Those who 
hold this view ( badha ) rely on such Vedic passages }m as ' one 
should offer agnihotra as long as life lasts' or 'indeed Agni- 
hotra is a satra ( sacrificial session ) that lasts till one dies by 
old age* (Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 1), 'one should desire to live a 
hunordd years performing religious acts * ( Vaj. S. 40. 2 ), ' after 
bringing to the teacher wealth desired by him, do not cut off 
the thread of progeny ' (Tai. Up. I. 11.1). The Mit. on Yaj. 
III. 56 sets out these three views and says that each is support- 
ed by Vedic texts and one may follow any one of the three* 
Ap. Dh. 8, ( II. 9. 21. 2 ) held the view that whatever asrama 
out of * e four one followed, one attained happiness if one 
performed its duties according to the sastra and after a lengthy 
discussion Ap. arrives at the conclusion that there is no dis- 
tinction due to superiority among the four asramas ]01 Â°. There 
were some who thought that the householder's life was the rule 
and the other asramas were for the blind and other incapable 
persons. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 56 refutes this view. 

The word asrama is derived 1011 from 'sram* to exert, to 
labour and etymologically means 'a stage in which one exerts 
oneself \

Commentators like Sarvajna-NarSyana on Manu VI. 35 
endeavour to bring about reconciliation between the three 
views set out above as follows : the view that a man may pass 
on to samnyasa immediately after the period of student-hood 
( without being a householder ) applies only to those men who 
are, owing to the impressions and effects of restrained conduct 
in past lives, entirely free from desires and whose tongue, sexual 
appetites, belly and words are thoroughly under control ; the 
prescriptions of Manu enjoining on men not to resort to sarhny- 
ftsa without paying off the three debts are concerned with men 
whose appetites have not yet thoroughly been brought under 
control and the words of Gautama that there is only one airama 
(that of the house-holder) relate only to those whose appetites 
for worldly pleasures and pursuits are quite keen. 



CHAPTER IX 

MARRIAGE 

This is the most important of all samsk&ras. Throughout 
the ages for which literary "tradition Is availablePin India 
martlageHasbeen highly thought of. The several words that 
are employed to denote the idea of marriage indicate one or 
more of the elements of the sarhskara of marriage. Such words 
are udvalia ( taking the girl out of her parental home ), vivaha 
( taking the girl away in a special way or for a special purpose 
i. e. for making her one's wife ), parinaya or parinayana 
( going round i. e. making a pradaksina to fire ), upayaraa ( to 
bring near and make one's own ), and pinigrahana ( taking the 
hand of the girl). Though these words express only one 
component element of the rite of marriage they are all used in 
the 6astras 1018 to indicate the totality of the several acts that 
go to make up the ceremony of marriage. The word ' vivaha ' 
occurs in the Tai. S. VII. 2. 87 and Ait. Br. ( 27. 5 ). In the 
Tandya 1013 Mahabrahmana VII. 10. 1 it is said that "heaven 
and earth were once together but they became separate ' ; then 
they said * let us bring about a marriage, let there be a co-ope- 
ration between us'." 

Before dwelling upon the various aspects of marriage, the 
question, whether our authorities point to a state of society 
when there was no institution of marriage, but there was only 
promisouity, requires to be considered. The Vedic works con- 
tain no indications about a society in which the relations of 
the sexes were promiscuous and unregulated. In the Maha- 
bharata, 10u however, Pandu is made to state to his queen Kuntl 
that women in former ages were under no control, indulged 
themselves as they liked and that they left off one man and

went after another, that this state of things continued to his 
( Pandu's ) day in the country of Uttara Kuru, that it was 
Svetaketu, son of Uddalaka, who for the first time stopped all 
this license and laid down the rule that if a woman proved falBe 
to her husband or if a husband was false to a chaste wife, very 
grave sin would be incurred. In the Sabhaparva ( 31. 37-38 ) 
it is said that through the favour of Agni women in MahismatI 
did what they liked and could not be restrained. These passages 
cannot be relied upon for proving promiscuity of intercourse. 
In the first place, the country of Uttara Kuru is more or less 
mythical. This passage rather gives expression to what the 
poet imagined about remotest ages and not what he knew was 
the real state of society thousands of years before him. The 
theory of an original state of promiscuity once advanced by 
several sociologists has now ceased to be respectable ( vide Mrs.

The purpose of marriage, even according to the Rgveda, 
was to enable a man, by becoming a householder, to perform 
sacrifices to the gods and to procreate sons. The verse in Bg. 
X. 85. 36 shows that the husband took a woman as a wife for 
' garhapatya \ Rg. V. 3. 2., V. 28. 3 speak of the co-operation 
of husband and wife in the worship of gods. Rg. III. 53. *4 
contains the emphatic assertion ' the wife herself is the home * 
( jayed-astam ). In later literature also the same statement 
occurs. A wife was called * jaya \ because the husband was 
born in the wife as a son ( Ait. Br. 33. 1 ). The Sat. Br. V. 2. 1. 
10 says ' the wife 1015 is indeed half of one's self ; therefore as 
long as a man does not secure a wife so long he does not beget 
a son and so he is till then not complete ( or whole ) ; but when 
he secures a wife he gets progeny and then he becomes complete \ 
The Ait. Ar. ( I. 2. 4 ) says ' therefore a man, after securing a 
wife, regards himself as more complete*. When Ap. Dh. S. 
II. 5. 11. 12 forbids taking a second wife if the first is endowed 
with progeny and the performance of religious rites, it indicates

that the main purposes of marriage are two, ,0)6 viz. the wife 
enables a man to perform religious rites and is the mother of a 
son or sons who were supposed to save a man from hell. 
Manu ( IX. 28 ) states that on the wife depend the procreation 
of sons, the performance of religious rites, service, highest 
pleasure, heaven for oneself and for one's ancestors. So these 
three viz. dharmasampatti, praja ( and consequent freedom from 
falling into hell ) and rati (sexual and other pleasures) are the 
principal purposes of marriage according to the snortis and 
nibandhas. Yaj. I. 78 is to the same effect. Jaimini (VI. 1. 17 ff) 
establishes that husband and wife have to perform sacrifices 
together and not separately and Ap. Dh. S. 1017 II. 6. 13. 16-17 
emphatically says that there can be no separation between 
husband and wife, for since marriage they have to perform 
religious acts jointly. 

Marriage is a composite rite comprising several subordinate 
elements which ha~veTo be done in a certain order and the last 
of which is seeing the constellation of the seven sages ; it ( rite ) 
brings about the status of a woman as a person's wife. 1018 

The first consideration is : how to choose a bridegroom and 
what qualifications make a person a very desirable bridegroom. 
Asv. gr. (I. 5. 2 ) says * one should give a maiden 1019 ( in 
marriage ) to a man endowed with intelligence \ The Ap. gr. 
(3. 20 ) remarks " the accomplishments of a bridegroom are 
that he must be endowed with good family, a good character, 
auspicious characteristics, learning and good health ". Baud. 
Dh. S. IV. 1. 12 states * a maiden should be given in marriage to 
one who is endowed with good qualities and who is a celibate 
( till then ) \ Even the Sakuntala ( IV ) echoes the words of

i30 History of Dharmaiastra [ Oh. IX 

Baudhayana ' the best idea is to give one's daughter to a man 
endowed with good qualities'. Yama quoted in the Sm. 0. (I. p. 78) 
says * one should seek for seven qualities in a bridegroom viz. 
good family, good character, bodily appearance, fame, learning! 
wealth and support ( of relatives and friends ); the other matters 
need not be considered *. Brhat-paraSara ( p. 118 Jiv. ed. ) 
enumerates eight qualities in a bridegroom viz. caste, learning, 
youth, strength, health, support of many ( friends &c. ), ambi- 
tions ( arthitva ), and possession of wealth. Asv.gr. (I. 5. 1) and 
others place kula ( a good family ) in the forefront in the case 
of both the bride and the bridegroom. 1080 * One should first 
examine the family ( of the intended bride or bridegroom ) 
as it has been said above (in the Asv. Srauta sutra IX. 3 ).' 
The AÂ§v. Srauta reads * those who on their mother's as well as 
their father's side through ten generations are endowed with 
learning, austerity and meritorious works or whose pure 
brahmana lineage can be traced on both sides ( for ten genera- 
tions) or according to some on the father's side.' Manu regarded 
a good family as the most important from the eugenic point 
of view. In IV. 244 he says ' one who desires to raise his 
family to excellence and eminence should always enter into 
marriage alliances with the best and avoid alliance with the 
low '; and adds (III. 6-7) that ten kinds of families even though 
richly endowed with cattle, wealth &o. should be avoided in 
marriage viz. in which the samskaras are not performed, in 
which there is no male progeny, which are devoid of Veda (study), 
which have hairy members, that suffer from piles or consumption 
or indigestion or epilepsy, white or blaok leprosy. Manu ( III. 
63-65 ) explains under what circumstances good families are 
reduced to a bad state. Harlta states that the offspring is in 
accordance with the (qualities of the) family of the parents. The 
Harsacarita ( IV ) gives expression to the view that generally 
the wise look to good family first even though there may be 
other qualities in the bridegroom. Manu II. 238, however, allows 
a man to marry a girl even from an inferior or bad family 
provided she is a jewel among women.

Yaj. ( L 54-55 ) emphasizes the importance of a good 
family famed for ten generations and freedom from diseases 
that are hereditarily transmitted and adds that the bride- 
groom must be young, intelligent, a favourite among the 
people and his virility must be carefully tested. The Mit. on 
Y&j. 1. 55 quotes Narada ( strlpurhsa ) who mentions some 
characteristics of the virile man and enumerates fourteen 
varieties of impotent persons ( verses 11-13 ). Katyayana ,oai 
mentions what defective bridegrooms are to be avoided viz. 
the lunatic, one guilty of grave sins, leprous, impotent, 
one of the same gotra, one bereft of eyesight or hearing, an 
epileptic and adds that these defects are to be avoided even 
among brides. The Mahabharata observes 'friendship and 
marriage should take place between those alone whose wealth 
is similar and whose learning (i. e. the learning in whose fami- 
lies) is of equal status, not between opulent (well-off) and 
the poverty-stricken*. ,028 

Though Manu and Yaj. indicate that impotent persons are 
not eligible for marriage, yet such persons rarely married. 
Their marriages were held valid by Manu, Yaj. and others 
and their sons ( by niyoga ) took property as if they were aurasa 
sons. Vide Manu IX. 203 and Yaj. II. 141-142. 

The Sarhskaraprakasa ( pp. 752-754 ) contains a long dis- 
cussion on the question how from bodily characteristics one can 
find whether a man will live long or what his prospects would 
be. These are passed over for want of space. 

Rules for the selection of the bride are far more elaborate 
than those for selecting a bridegroom, though in some respects 
they are the same ( such as about the necessity of good family, 
about the absence of diseases &o. ). Vide Vas I. 38, Visnu Dh.

gives expression to the then view that broad hips and slender 
waists make women attractive. Asv. gr. I. 5. 3 says l084 ' one 
should marry a girl who is endowed with intelligence, beauty, 
a good character and auspicious characteristics and who is 
healthy'. San. gr. I. 5. 6 and Manu III. 4 and Yaj. I. 52 also 
require that the girl should be possessed of auspicious charac- 
teristics ( or indications ). These ( laksanas ) are of two kinds, 
bahya ( visible or bodily characteristics ) and abhyantara 
(invisible). Ap. gr. 1025 ( III. 21 ) states a cornmonsense rule: 
'a girl on whom his mind and eyes are riveted will bring him 
happiness ( or prosperity ), he should pay no heed to other 
things; this is the view of some'. The Kamasutra quotes the 
view of Ghotakamukha * he should proceed to marry a girl on 
taking whom as his wife he would regard himself as blessed 
and would not be blamed by his friends (or persons in a similar 
station in life ) ' xm . Manu III. 8 and 10, Visnu Dh. S. 24. 
12-16 say that one should not marry a girl having tawny hair or 
having an excessive limb ( suoh as a sixth finger ) or a deficient 
limb, who is hairless or very hairy, who is talkative and has 
yellowish eyes ; but should marry a girl who has limbs void of 
any defect, whose gait is like that of a swan or an elephant, 
the hair on whose head or body is of slight growth and whose 
teeth are small, whose body is delicate. The Visnu-purana 
( III. 10. 18-22 ) adds that the girl must not have a marked 
growth of hair on her chin or lip, her voice must not be hoarse 
or like that of a crow ; her legs and ankles must not be very 
hairy, there should be no dimples on her cheeks when she 
laughs, she should not be very dwarfish or very tall &c. Manu 
III. 9 and Ap. gr. ( III. 13 ) say that the girl to be married must 
not bear names of the lunar mansions ( such as Re vat J, Ardra 
&c. ), trees or rivers, she must not bear a mleccha name or that

of a mountain, of a bird, of a snake or of a slave or a name that 
is terrific. Ap. gr. ( III. 14 ) and Kamasutra III. 1. 13 mention 
that a girl should not; be chosen, the penultimate letter of whose 
name is r or 1 ( such as Gaurl, Sail, Kamalu). Narada im ( strl- 
pumsayoga 36) says that defects of girls are as follows: â when 
they suffer from long-standing or disgusting diseases, when they 
are devoid of a limb or have already had connection with an- 
other man, when they are wicked or have their minds fixed on 
another ; and Ap, gr. ( III. 11-12 ) states other defects of girls 
viz. one should not choose a girl who is asleep or weeps or has 
left the house when persons come to see whether she can be 
chosen. Vide Markandeya-purana 34. 76-77 for gunas and 
defects of girls as * brides \ 

Bhar. gr. 1. 11 says that there are four inducing reasons 1028 for 
marrying a particular girl viz. wealth, beauty, intelligence and 
family. If all four cannot be secured, wealth may be neglected 
(as the least important of all ) ; then beauty may be neglected if 
there is intelligence and good family, but there is a difference of 
view as to the latter two, some preferring intelligence to family 
and others family to intelligence. Manava gr. ( I. 7. 6-7 ) adds a 
fifth inducement for marriage, viz. vidya ( learning ) after 
beauty and before prajna. Vide also Varaha gr. 10. 

Some of the grhyasutras propose a peculiar mystical method 
of selecting a bride. The A3v. gr. ( I. 5. 3 ) after stating that 
one should select a girl endowed with good characteristics 
( laksanas ) proceeds ' laksanas are very difficult to discern ' 
and therefore prescribes ( I. 5. 5-6 ) that eight lumps of different 
kinds of earth should be taken respectively from a field that 
yields two crops a year, from a cow-stable, from a vedl ( sacrifi- 
cial altar, after sacrifice is performed ), from a pool of water 
that does not dry up, from a gambling place, from a place 
where four roads meet, from a barren spot, and from a burial 
ground ; then he should recite over the lumps the formula ' Ha 
( right ) has been born first in the beginning ; truth is founded 
( or fixed ) in rta ; may this girl attain here that for which she 
is born ; may what is true be visible ; ' then he says to the girl

9 take one of these \ According as she chooses the lump, it may 
respectively be deemed that she will have offspring rich in food 
( if she chooses the lump of the earth taken from the field of 
two crops a year &c. ), or rich in cattle, or rich in spiritual 
lustre or rich in everything, or addicted to gambling, or 
wandering in different directions or poor, or that she will bring 
death to her husband ( if she takes the lump of the earth from 
the burial ground ). The Gobhila gr. II. 1. 4-9 speaks of these 
lumps and adds that a ninth lump may be formed by mixing 
up the earths of all eight varieties and that if she takes up any 
one of tho four lumps of earth from an altar, furrow, a pool or 
a cow-stable or ( according to some ) the ninth lump, she may 
be selected. J'he Laugaksi gr. 14. 4-7 contains the same rules as 
in Gobhila. Ap. gr. 10 * 9 (III. 15-18) prescribes a somewhat different 
method. If both sides agree, the bridegroom (or his friends) should 
place in one lump of earth several kinds of seeds (such as rice,barley 
&c); he should take (a lump having in it) che dust from an altar, a 
third having a clod from a ploughed field, a lump having cowdung 
inside and (a fifth having) a clod of earth from a cemetery and keep- 
ing them before the girl ask her to touch one of them (the five ). 
If she touches any one of the firnt four, that is an indication of 
future prosperity ( of the nature of the object touched ), but 
tho last ( viz. clod of eaith from cemetery ) is objectionable. 
The Varaha gr. 10 and Bhar. gr. 1. 11 speak of only four lumps 
of earth viz. from a field, from an altar, from a cow-stable, 
and from a cemetery and say that one should not marry a girl 
who takes up the lump of cemetery earth. Manava gr. ( I. 7. 
9-10 ) speaks of eight lumps but substitutes a lump of earth 
where diirva grows and a lump from under a tree filled with 
fruit for earth from a pool of water and one from a gambling 
place and adds that the eight lumps should bo placed in a 
temple and if the girl takes up the lump from a cemetery or 
from a barren spot or from where four roads meet she should 
not be married. Many digests like theGr.R. (pp. 13-22) contain 
long quotations which dilate upon the indications about the" 
auspiciousness or otherwise of girls from their several physi- 
cal features; 

Gaut. IV. 1, Vas. 8. 1, Manava gr. I. 7. 8, Yaj. I. 52 and 
several others say that the girl must be younger ( yavlyasl ) 

s^tf qfrsrsft i 3*t<t. ^. 3. 15-18. 



Ch. IX ] Marriage-choosing a bride 435 

than the bridegroom and the Kamasutra ( III. 1. 2 ) recommends 
that she must be younger than the bridegroom by at least three 
years. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 52 explains ' yavlyasl ' as meaning 
' younger in age and smaller in stature * ( than the bridegroom ). 
What the age of marriage was will be discussed a little below. 

Gaut. IV. 1, ,oso Vas. 8. 1, Yaj. I. 52, Manu ( III. 4 and 12 ) 
and others say that one should marry only a girl who is a 
virgin and of the same caste. How far widow-marriages and 
intercaste marriages were allowed would be discussed later on. 

The Manava.gr. 1. 7. 8, Manu III. 11 and Yaj. 1. 53 require that 
the girl to be chosen must not be brotherless. This requirement 
which has been not in force for centuries has a long history 
behind it. In Rg. I. 124. 7 it is said mi ' as a brotherless maiden 
comes back towards her male relations (her father's family). ..so 
the dawn reveals objects ( or her beauty ).' In the Atharvaveda 
I. 17. 1 we read * like brotherless women let them sit still with 
their splendour gone \ Both these passages are quoted and 
explained in the Nirukta III. 4-5. In ancient times when a 
man had no son, he could make his daughter do for a son ( i. e. 
she herself became putrika ) and stipulate with the person 
marrying her that the son born of her would be his ( i. e. the 
girl's father's ) son and would offer pindas as a son to his 
maternal grandfather. The result would be that the son of 
such a girl would not offer pindas to his father and would not 
continue the line of his father. Rg. III. 31. 1 (a very obscure 
and difficult verse ) has been explained by the Nirukta ( III. 4 ) 
as referring to the practice of declaring a daughter to bo one's 
son 1028 . Therefore, brotherless maidens were not chosan as 
brides and the Rg. speaks of spinsters growing old in their 
parental home ( Rg. II. 17. 7 ). Vas. Dh. S. 17. 16 refers m * to

Rg. 1. 124. 7 and quotes a verse about a brotherless girl. Such 
a daughter at whose marriage the father made the stipulation 
stated above was called putrika and according to Gaut. 28. 17 
some 10S * teachers went bo far as to say that a daughter became 
a putrika by the mental resolve of the father alone ( without 
there being an express agreement with the bridegroom ). It is 
therefore that Manu ( 3. 11 ) ordains that one should not marry 
a girl that has no brother, as there is the danger of her being a 
putrika. The Nirukta ( III. 5 ) quotes another 1035 Vedic passage 
'one should not marry a brotherless woman, for she becomes 
the son of him ( her father ) ' and remarks that in this passage 
there is a direct prohibition against marrying a brotherless 
maiden (while in the passage of the Atharvaveda it is indirect, 
being involved in a simile) and it is also expressly said that she 
becomes the son of her father. In medieval times this prohibi- 
tion against marrying a brotherless girl gradually was ignored 
and in modern times the pendulum has swung the other way, 
a brotherless girl being a coveted prize if her father be rich. 
In course of time popular feeling changed and no girl could 
remain unmarried if she wanted heavenly worlds. There is an 
interesting story in the Salyaparva chap. 52 of the daughter of 
Kunigarga who, when told by Narada that an unmarried 
woman could not secure heaven, married for one day Sriigavat 
and then went to heaven. 

There are further restrictions about choosing a girl for 
marriage. The rule was that a man should marry a girl of the 
same caste. So far there is what is called endogamy ( i. e. rule 
requiring marriage within a certain large community ). But 
within this large community there were certain groups which 
were prohibited for marriage to a person belonging to another 
group of the same caste or community ( i. e. the principle of 
exogamy* operated within the large community itself ). The 
Hir. gr. 1. 19. 2, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 4, Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 15 
require that the bride to be chosen must not belong to the same 
gotra as that of the bridegroom. They are all silent about the 
sameness of pravara. Gaut. IV. 2â Vas. Dh. S. VIII, 1, MSnava

the sameness of gotra, It is somewhat remarkable that some 
of the grhyasutras like Asv. and Par. say not a word about 
sameness of gotra and pravara. Visnu Dh. S. 24. 9, Vaik. III. 2, 
Yaj. I. 53, Nfirada ( strlpurhsa, verse 7 ), Vedavyasa II. 2 and 
many others prohibit sameness of gotra as well as of pravara. 
Gobhila gr. III. 4. 5, Manu III. 5, Vaik. Ill, 2 and Ap. Db. S. 
II. 5. 11. 16 require that the bride must not be a sapinda or 
blood relation of the mother of the bridegroom ; while Gaut- 
IV. 2, Vas. VIII. 2, Visnu Dh. S. 24. 10, Varaha gr. 9, Sankha 
Dh. ( quoted above ), Yaj, I. 53 and others restrict the prohibi- 
tion against marrying a sapinda girl to seven degrees on the 
father's side and five degrees on the mother's side. There were 
others like the Vedavyasa-smrti which not only prohibited 
marriage with a girl who had the same gofcra as the bride- 
groom's, but prohibited marriage with a girl whose mother's 
gotra was the same as the bridegroom's, 

All these prohibitions against marrying a sagoira, sapravara 
or sapinda girl are extremely important, as the following 
considerations will show. It is a canon of the Purvaralmarhsa 
that if there is a seen ( drs^a ) or easily perceptible reason for 
a rule stated in the sacred texts, it is only recommendatory 
and a breach of such a rule does not nullify the principal act. 
But if there is an unseen ( adrsfa ) reason for a rule and there 
is a breach of such rule, the principal act itself is rendered 
invalid and nugatory thereby. The rule about not mairying 
a woman who is diseased or who has superfluous or deficient 
limbs has a seen reason viz. marriage with suoh a girl causes 
unhappiness ( if she is diseased ) or comment ( if she has defi- 
cient limbs). Therefore, if a person marries such a girl the 
marriage is perfectly valid. But there is no seen or easily 
perceptible reason for the prohibition against marrying a 
sagotra or sapravara girl. Therefore, such rules go to the root of 
the matter and are obligatory and, if there is a breach of them, 
the marriage is no marriage, it is null and void. So even if 
a person goes through a ceremony of marriage with a girl who

against marrying a sapravara girl.

is a sagotra or sapravara or sapinda ( within prohibited degrees ) 
she does not in law become his wife at all. These principles 
are very lucidly set ,027 forth by Medhafcithi on Manu III. 11, 
by the Mit. on Yaj. I. 53, the Madanaparijata and other works. 
Therefore, these questions of sagofcra, sapravara and sapinda will 
be dealt with at some length later on. 

The question of the age of marriage for men and women will 
now be considered. This is a very interesting and instructive 
study. The age of marriage for both sexes has varied consider- 
ably from age to age, from province to province and also from 
caste to caste even at the same time. 10 * 8 As regards men there 
is no special rule as to the age before which a man was obliged 
to marry. A man could remain celibate all his life, while at 
least in medieval and modern times marriage has been abso- 
lutely necessary for every girl. A man was to marry after he 
had finished his Vedic studies; but the period of Vedic study 
was fluctuating ( i, e. it could be 12, 24, 36, 48 years or as much 
time as was necessary to master one Veda or a portion of it ). 
Usually twelve years were devoted to brahmacarya in ancient 
times and as upanayana ordinarily took place in the 8th year 
(for brahm anas) a man would ordinarily be 20 years old or 
more at the time of marriage. It is therefore that Manu ( IX. 
94 ) remarks that a man of thirty may marry a girl of twelve 
years or a man of 24 who is in a hurry to become a house- 
holder may marry a girl of eight. Basing on this the Visnu- 
purana ,0S9 (III. 10. 16) says that the ages of the bride and 
bridegroom should be in the ratio of 1 to 3. Ahgiras says that 
the bride should be two, three, five or more years younger. In

Ch. IX ] Age of Marriage for girls 439 

the Mahabharata ,04 Â° Gautama is prepared to give his daughter 
in marriage to Uttaiika if he could be a youth of 16 years. In 
another place the Mahabharata ( Sabha 64. 14 and Vanaparva 
5. 15) uses the simile of a maiden not liking a husband of 60 
yeaTs. That shows that girls were sometimes married to even 
old men of 60 in those days as rarely in modern times also. In 
the Mahabharata ( Anusasana 44. 14) the respective ages of the 
bridegroom and bride are recommended as 30 and 10 or 21 and 
7; while the Udvahatattva (p. 123) and S. Pr. p. 766 quote a 
verso from the Mahabharata that a man of 30 should marry a 
girl of 16 (but from the metre and context it appears that 
4 sodasa-varsani * as printed should be ' da^a-varsam )\ 

In the Rgveda there are no clear statements about the exact 
age when girls were married. But there are indications that 
many girls were married at a sufficiently mature age (at least they 
wero not married at the tender age of eight ). We have already 
seen (p. 435 ) that brotherless girls often remained unmarried till 
old age. One of the benevolent deeds 1041 of the Aivins is that 
they bestowed a husband on Ghosa who was growing old in her 
father's house. Vide also Rg. 1. 124. 7, II. 17. 7, and Atharva- 
veda 1. 17. 1. In Rg. X. 27. 12 it is said ' when a bride is fine 
looking and well adorned, she by herself seeks her friend from 
among men \ That shows that girls were grown-up enough to 
select their husbands. Some of the verses in the marriage hymn 
( such as Rg. X. 85. 26-27, 46 ) indicate ,01B that married girls 
could not have been child-wives, but must have been grown-up. 
On the other hand in Rg. 1. 116. 1 it is said that the Nasatyes 
( A&vins ) bestowed a wife on Vimada who was an arbhaga ( of 
tender age ). 104S But all that is meant seems to be that Vimada 
was a mere boy as compared with his rival kings who had 
come as suitors. The two verses Rg. I. 126. 6-7 ( which are 
rather too naive ) indicate that girls were married before they 
had attained puberty. In Rg. I. 51. 13 Indra is said to have 
given to old Kakslvat a wife named VrcayS who is styled 
â¢ arbha * ( young )â¢ But that word is only used in contradistinc- 
tion to the word ' raahate ' ( grown old ) applied to Kakslvat

and conveys no idea of her exact age. 1044 On the whole one 
may conclude that in the period of the Rgveda girls were 
probably married at any age ( either before puberty or after 
puberty ) and sometimes remained spinsters all their life. The 
other Sarhhitas and the Brahmanas do not shed much light on 
the question of the age of marriage for girls. In the Chan. Up. 
Usasti CakrSyana is described as dwelling in the Kuru country 
with his wife, who is said to have been ' a^ikl ' which Samkara 
explains as ' a mere undeveloped girl \ 1M5 

Coming to the ancient grhya and dharma eutras, it will be 

seen from several considerations that girls were married just 

before the time of puberty or immediately after it. Among 

the several requirements of the bride to be chosen several grhya 

sutras lay down that she must be a ' nagnika \ Vide Hir. gr. 

1. 19. 2, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 6, Manava gr. I. 7. 8, Vaik. VI. 12. 1046 

The word nagnika is variously explained by the commentators. 

Matrdatta on Hir. gr. explains that nagnika means ' one whose 

menstrual period is near ' i. e. one who is fit for intercourse. 

As^avakra, the commentator of the Manava gr., explains 

nagnikS. as ' one who has not yet experienced the impulses and 

emotions of youth ' or ' one who looks pretty even without 

clothes ' ( taking the word along with ' srestham ' that follows ). 

The Grhyasamgraha 1047 ( which is much later than the Gobhila 

gr. ) explains * nagnika ' as one who has not yet reached puberty. 

These varying explanations of the word ' nagnika ' are due to 

the fact that when some smrfcis and commentators wrote child 

marriages were not in vogue, while they were in vogue when 

and where others flourished. Vas. Dh. S. 17. 70 says 'the father

should give away his daughter while she is still nagnika 
through fear of her attaining puberty ( while unmarried ).' 
This shows that according to Vas. nagnika must have been a 
girl of tender years or one that had not attained puberty. 

There is another very important indication. Most of the 
grhyasutras prescribe that the married couple should be celibate 
for at least three nights after marriage ( if not for a longer 
period ). For example, the Par. gr. ( I. 8 ) says 1018 ' the married 
pair should (after marriage) not partake of ksara and larana for 
three nights, should sleep on the ground ( and not on a cot, for 
the same period ) and should not have intercourse for a year, 
twelve nights, six nights, three nights in the last resort \ Vide 
for a similar rule Asv. gr. I. 8. 10, Ap. gr. 8. 8-9, San. gr. 
I. 17. 5, Manava gr. I. 14. 14, Kathaka gr. 30. 1, Khadira gr. 
I. 4. 9 and others. Such an injunction against intercourse for 
three nights after marriage would have been uncalled for and 
extremely inappropriate if girls had been usually married 
when they were only eight to ten years old. Such injunctions . 
by so many authors presuppose that girls must have generally 
been very near puberty or past puberty at the time of marriage. 
Haradatta who belongs to about the 12th century A. D. expressly 
Bays ,049 that ( in his days ) in certain countries intercourse was 
commenced immediately after marriage and that such a usage 
being opposed to Asv. gr. I. 8. 10 should not be followed ( but 
continence should be observed at least for three days after 
marriage ). This shows that so late as 1200 A. D, in several 
countries the marriageable age of girls must have been at 
least about 14. 

In most of the grhyasulras there is a rite called ' caturthl- 
karma ' ( rite on 4th day after marriage ). Vide Gobhila II, 5, 
San. gr. I. 18-19, Khadira gr. I. 4. 12-16, Par. gr. I. 11, Ap. grÂ» 
8. 10-11, Kir. gr. I. 23-24 &c. This rite has been described above 
(pp. 203-204) and corresponds to the garbhadhana of later writers 
( e. g. Yaj. I. 11 ). As cohabitation is expressly mentioned in 
connection with this rite performed on the fourth day after

marriage it follows that girls must have generally been quite 
grown-up at the time of marriage. 

In some of the grhyasufcras and smrfcis a slight prayascitta 
( purificatory ceremony ) is prescribed if the bride has menstrua- 
tion during the progress of the marriage ceremonies. Vide 
Baud. gr. IV. 1. 10, Kausika sutra 79. 16, Vaik. VI. 13, Atri 
( ed. by Jiv. part I. p. 11 ). 

Gaut. 1050 (18. 20-23) says 'a girl should be given in marriage 
before she attains the age of puberty. He who neglects it 
commits sin. Some declare that she should be given 
in marriage before she begins to wear clothes. A marria- 
geable girl ( who is not given in marriage by her father 
&c. ) should allow three monthly periods to pass and after- 
wards unite herself to a blameless man of her own will and 
give up the ornaments received from her father (or her 
family ) \ This passage establishes that even before Gautama 
( i. e. 500 or 600 B. C. ) there were people who advocated 
marriages of infant girls that did not care to put on clothes 
( i. e. who had no sense of shame if they went about without 
clothes ), that Gautama disapproved of this view, that he only 
prescribed that the marriage of girls should take place before 
puberty and he was not horrified if girls got themselves married 
sometime after puberty. But it is clear that no blame 
attached to the girl married after puberty or to the husband ; 
the idea, however, had arisen even then that the father or 
guardian incurred blame or sin by not getting a girl married 
before puberty. Manu ( IX. 89-90 ) goes so far as to say 
' A maiden may rather stay in her father's house even till her 
death, though she may have attained puberty ; but the father 
should never give her to one who is devoid of good qualities. A 
maiden after attaining puberty may wait for three years ( to 
see if she is given away by her father or brother &c. ) but after 
this period she should seek a husband who is similar to her.' 
Anusasanaparva 44. 16 is to the same effect. Baud. Dh. S. 
IV. 1. 14 and Vas. V. Dh. S. 17. 67-68 give the same rule as in 
Manu IX. 90. But both add ( Vas. 17. 70-71 and Baud. Dh. S. 
IV.1.12)that the father or guardian incurs the sin of destroying 
an embryo at each appearance of menses as long es the girl is 

3m*3^$nft Â» srnnrHtfj nCM iW Mt i ift. 18. 20-23. 



Oh. IX ] Early Marriage for girls 443 

unmarried. Yaj. I. 64 and Narada ( strlpumsa, verses 25-27 ) 
state the same rule. 

On account of this change in popular beliefs and senti- 
ments it came to be recommended that a girl must be married 
early and may be given even to one 1051 who is devoid of 
qualities ( in spite of Manu IX 89 ). Vide Baud. Dh. S. 
IV. 1. 12 and 15. 

So we see that from about 600 B. 0. to about the beginning 
of the Christian Era it did not matter at all if a girl was 
married a few months or few years after puberty. But by about 
200 A. D. ( when the Y&j. smrti was composed ) popular feeling 
had become insistent on pre-puberty marriages. The reasons for 
this change are not quite clear. But it is possible to hold that it 
was due to the following circumstances. Buddhism had spread 
far and wide during these centuries with its encouragement 
of the institution of monks and nuns. There was laxity of 
morals among nuns. A further reason may be adduced viz. that 
girls had generally ceased to study anything, though some of them 
certainly did study in the times of Panini and Patanjali, and so 
society did not like girls to remain doing nothing. From the 
times of the Rgveda (X. 85. 40-41 ) there was a mystical belief 
that Soma, Gandharva and Agni were the divine guardians of 
a girl and the Grhyasarhgraha ( quoted in the com. on Gobhila gr. 
III. 4. 6 ) says that Soma enjoys a girl first, then Gandharva 
enjoys her when her breasts develop and fire when she men- 
truates. Therefore, a feeling arose that a girl must be married 
even before she develops any distinct signs of femininity. 
Sarhvarta l05Z ( verses 64 and 67 ) gives expression to this idea. 
Further, since marriage came to be looked upon as the upanayana 
in the case of women, naturally the ageTbr upanayana (8th year) 
came to be looked upon as the proper age for marriage. Vide 
Sarhskarakaustubha quoted below. It came to be believed that 
there was no hope of heaven for a woman who died unmarried.

sÂ£4 History of Dharmaiastra I Ch. IX 

In the Salyaparva 108 * chap. 52 we have the story of a girl, 
daughter of Kuni Garga, who practised severe penance till she 
reached old age and yet was told by Narada that if she died 
unmarried she would not go to heaven. The woman induced 
Sriigavat of the Galava family for a day previous to her death to 
marry her by the promise of giving him half of her merit (punya). 
The Vaik. 1054 ( V. 9), while describing the ceremony of funeral 
rifces in cases of distress, mentions the curious practice of find- 
ing out a male of the same caste for a girl, who dies unmarried 
though of the age of puberty, with whom a sort of marriage is 
gone through and the girl is then cremated. Whatever the reasons 
may be, this tendency to bring clown the age of marriage for 
girls was accentuated in the first five or six centuries of the 
Christian era. The Laugaksi 1055 gr. ( 19. 2 ) says * brahmacarya 
for girls lasts till the 10th or 12th year \ The Vaik. ( VI. 12 ) 
says that a brahmana should marry a brahmana girl who is a 
nagnika or gauri and defines nagnika as a girl over eight years 
but less than ten and gauri as one who is between ten and 
twelve and has not had menstruation. Apararka ( p. 85 ) quotes 
the Bhavisyapurana to the effect that nagnika is one who is ten 
years old. Vide Sm. C. quoting Samgraha. Parasara, Yaj. 
and Samvarta go even beyond this. Parasara 1056 (VII. 6-9) 
says ' a girl of eight is called gauri, but one who is nine years 
old is a rohinl ; one who is ten years old is a kanya; beyond this 
( i. e. after 10 years ) she is a rajasvala. If a person does not 
give away a maiden when she has reached her 12th year, his 
pitrs have to drink every month her menstrual discharge. The 
parents and also the eldest brother go to hell on seeing ( an 
unmarried ) girl reaching the state of a rajasvala \ Parasara 
adds that the brahmana who marries such a girl should not be 
spoken to or admitted to dinner in the same row ( as other

brahmanas ) and that he becomes the husband of a vrsall. On 
the other hand the Vayupurana ( 83. 44 ) extols the marriage of 
a gaurl by remarking that her son purifies 21 ancestors on his 
father's side and 6 male ancestors on his mother's side. Sarhvarta 
( verse 65-66 ) has the same two verses as Parasara (VII. 6 and 8) 
and winds up (verse 67) by saying that the marriage of a girl of 
eight is highly commended. The same four verses (Para&ara VII. 
6-9 ) occur in Brhad-Yama ( Anan. ed. ) chap. 3. 19-22, but the 
order is different. Angiras ( vv. 126-128, Anan. ed. ) has the 
same verses. Kasyapa as quoted in thu Gr. R. (p. 46 ) says 
that a girl is called gaurl when she is seven, a kanyaka when 
she is ten and kumarl when she is twelve. It will be noticed 
that the smrfcis of Vaikhanasa and Kasyapa differed from 
Parasara as to the definition of gaurl. Further the three smrtis 
make marriage of a girl after puberty an extremely sinful act 
and condemn not only the parents but also the husband, while 
Baud, prescribed only a slight prayascitta for the father alone 
even if there was menstruation during the marriage rites. 
Marloi 1057 ( quoted in Par. M. I. 2. p. 177 ) said that choosing a 
bride who was five years old was best. Even Manu ( 9. 88 ) 
recommended an early marriage if a very desirable bridegroom 
was available. Rama and Slta are said to have been respective, 
ly 13 and 6 at the time of marriage ( Arapyakanda 47. 10-11 ). 
But this passage appears to bo an interpolation. In the 
Balakanda 1058 it is expressly stated that Slta and her sisters 
enjoyed in private dalliance with their respective husbands 
immediately after marriage. If this is true then Slta could nofc 
have been only 6 at the time of marriage. 

The rule that biahmana girls were to be married between 
8 to 10 years became general from about the 6th or 7th century 
and continued down to modern times. During the last two or 
three decades the marriageable age of girls owing to several causes, 
particularly the ravages of plague and the economic condition 
of the middle classes, has risen very high and marriages of girls 
even of poor brahmanas hardly ever take place before 16 and 
have to be postponed to the age of 20 and beyond. Besides

by Act 19 of 1938) has fixed the minimum age limit for girls at 
14 and persons getting their daughters married before the 
completion of 14 years are liable to be punished in a criminal 
court under the Act. There is no reason to laugh at ancient Indian 
writers for the low age of marriage they advocated. Child 
marriages were common in all countries of Europe. Even in 
England the age limits for boys and girls were recognised by 
the law only at 14 and 12 respectively until 1929, when the 
lowest marriageable age for both was fixed at 16 ( 19 and 20 
Geo. V. Chap. 36 ). Besides it must be remembered that when 
marriages of girls of tender years took place they were purely a 
sacrament. There was no question of consummation which took 
place only after puberty. Sages condemned intercourse even 
with one's wife before she attained puberty. ,0S9 Winternitz in 
â¢ Die Prau.' p. 135 refers to a work of F. J. Furnivall on * Child 
Marriages, Divorces &c ' between 1560-66 A. D. in England 
from which it is clear that marriages of children of 9 or 10 (and 
rarely of even 2 or 3 years ) took place in England only about 
300 years ago. 

These rules about the proper age for the marriage of girls 
affected only brahmanas. Sanskrit poets and dramatists always 
depict that the heroines in their works are grown-up at the time 
of marriage and even Bhavabhuti imagines that MalatI, the 
heroine of his romantic drama of Malatlmadhava, was so 
grown-up that it was practically a case of love at first sight. 
Vaik. ( VI. 12 ) requires a brahmana bride to be a nagnika or 
gauri, but does not prescribe the same qualification for a 
ksatriya or vaisya bride. In the Harsacarita princess RajyasrI 
is described as quite grown-up at the time of her marriage which 
was consummated on the very day of marriage ( vide the last 
para, of the 4th Ucchvasa ). The Sarhskara-prakasa 1060 expressly 
says that there is no prohibition against marrying a girl who 
has passed the age of puberty for ksatriyas and others. Even 
in Pauranic times grown-up unmarried girls must not have been 
unheard of. The Gr. R. p. 83 quotes a passage from the 
Brahmapurana where the injunction to observe complete celi-

bacy for one year, 12 days, 6 days or 3 days is construed as 
respectively referring to girls whose ages were 8, 12, 16 or 20 at 
the time of marriage. 1081 

Another important question is inter-caste marriages. It has 
already been shown ( pp. 50-58 ) how anuloma marriages were 
allowed, while pratiloma unions were condemned and how it; 
was supposed that numerous sub-casfces arose from such mixed 
marriages. 

It is the contention of several eminent scholars ( e. g. 
Senart in his ' Caste in India * translated by Ross p. 124 ) that 
caste as implied in modern usage and in its strict sense did not 
exist in the times of the Rgveda and the other Vedio Sarhhitas. 
We have seen, however, that the four varnas had been reco- 
gnised in the times of the Sarhhitas and that ideas of superiority 
and inferiority due to being of a particular varna had become 
quite prevalent. But the practices as to marrying outside 
one's varna and taking food had not become as rigid and 
cast-iron as they became in medieval times. A few clear 
examples of inter-caste marriages may be cited from the Vedio 
Literature. The Sat. Br. ( IV. 1. 5, S. B. E. vol. 26, pp. 272-275 ) 
narrates the story of the old and decrepit sage Cyavana who 
was a Bhargava ( descendant of Bhrgu ) or Aiigirasa to Sukanya, 
the daughter of king Saryafca, a descendant of Manu. The 
Sat. Br. ( XIII. 2. 9. 8, 1062 S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 326 ) quotes a half 
verse from the Vaj. S. ( 26. 30 ) and then remarks ' therefore he 
does not anoint ( as king ) the son of the vaisya woman.' This 
suggests that a king might marry a vaisya girl, but her son 
would not have the Vedic coronation ceremony performed on 
him. Verses 17-19 of the ftgveda V. 61 are interpreted by the 
Brhad-devata (V. 50 ) as referring to the marriage of the 
brahmana sage Syavasva to the daughter of king Rathavlti 
Darbhya. The story of Kavasa Ailusa who was styled 4 dasyafc 
putra ' ( either meaning * the son of a dasl or used as a term of 
abuse ) by the sages has been mentioned above ( at p. 36 ).

448 History of Dharmasaslra [ Ch. IX 

Turning to the dharma and grhya sutras, the matter stands 
thus. Some of the grhya sufcras ( like Asv. f Ap.) do not expressly 
say anything about the varna of the bride. The Ap. Dh. S. 1063 
(II. 6. 13. 1 and 3) requires that one should marry a girl of the 
same varna, who was not given before to another and marriage 
with whom is in accordance with sastra and says that by contra- 
vening these rules sin is incurred. So he condemns mixed marria- 
ges. The Manava gr. 1.7. 8 and Gaut. IV. 1 require that one should 
marry a girl of the same varna and are silent about marriages 
with a bride of another varna. But Gautama knew of such 
marriages and enumerates the names of several sub-castes due 
to mixed marriages (IV. 14-17) and he includes among those 
who are unfit to be invited at a sraddha dinner a brahmana 
who is the husband of a woman of the sudra caste (15.18). 
Manu (III. 12), Sankha and Narada ,064 (strlpumsa, v. 4 ) say 
that the best course is to marry a girl of one's own caste. This 
is said to be purva kalpa ( the foremost or the best procedure ). 
Many also speak of a less advisable course ( anukatpa, as it is 
called ) viz. that a brahmana may take as wife a woman of any 
caste, a ksatriya may marry a woman of his own caste or a 
vaisya or a sudra woman, a vaisya may marry a vaisya or sudra 
woman and a sudra only a sudra woman. This is stated by 
Baud. Dh. S. I. 8. 2, Sankha, Manu III. 13, Visnu Dh. S. 24. 1-4. 
Par. gr. I. 4 and Vas. Dh. S. ,065 I. 25 inform us that some 
teachers allowed a dvija to maTry a sudra woman but without 
Vedic mantras. But Vasistha himself condemns it severely by 
saying 'one should not do so (i. e. marry a sudra girl), for by 
doing so the degradation of the family is certain and loss of 
heaven after death'. Though the Visnu Dh. S. and Manusmrti 
state that a dvijati may marry a sudra girl, that is not their own 
view, but they simply voice practices and sentiments prevalent 
in their time, sinco both denounce the marriage of a brahmana 
with a sudra girl in the most un-measured terms. Visnu 
Dh. S. 26. 5-6 ( S. B. E. vol. 7 p. 112 ) says that the union of 
a dvijati with a sudra woman can never produce religious

merit ; it is from carnal desire alone that he marries her being 
blinded by lust ; and that dvijati men who thus marry sudra 
women quickly degrade their families and progeny to the status 
of Sudras \ The ancient editor of the Manusmrti did net 
tolerate such marriages ( though he gave expression to the 
common trend of view in III. 12-13 ) and condemns a dvijati's 
marriage with a ^udra woman in the strongest language 
( III. 15-19, Manu III. 15 being the same as Visnu Dh. S. 26. 5 ) 
' a brahmana by having intercourse with a siidra woman goes 
to hell and by procreating a son on her he loses his status 
as a brahmana \ Yaj. I. 57 allowed a brahmana or ksatriya to 
marry a girl of his own varna or of the varnas next in order, 
but laid it down as his emphatic opinion thai * a dvijati should 
not marry a 6iidra girl \ It appears however that prevailing 
public opinion and practice was too much for both Manu and 
Yaj. ; for, both declare ( Yaj. II. 125 and Manu IX. 152-153 ) 
that when a brahmana has sons from wives of the four varnas, 
the son of a brahmana wife takes four shares ( out of 10 in 
which his wealth is to be divided ), the son of a ksatriya wife 
takes three, of a vai&ya wife two and of a Â§iidra wife one. Yaj. 
( I. 91-92 ) recognises the marriage of a brahmana with a sudra 
and says that the son of such a union is a parasava \ Manu 
III. 44 also recognises the marriage of a sudra girl with one of a 
higher class by saying that she holds the hem of the garment of 
a bridegroom of a higher class. 

This shows that the ancient smrfcis ungrudgingly recognised 
marriages between a brahmana and a ksatriya or a vaisya girl. 
But opinion was not unanimous about the marriage of a dvijati 
with a Sudra woman. Such marriages took place, but were 
looked upon with disfavour and often condemned with severity* 
Anuloina marriages were frequent enough till the 9th or 10th 
century A. Dâ but became rare later and for the last several 
hundred years they hardly ever took place or they were not at 
all recognized as valid by the communities concerned. The 
opigraphio records furnish well authenticated instances of 
inter-caste marriages. The Vakatakas were brahmanas (their gotra 
being Visnuvrddha). The Poona plates of Prabhavatlgupta (E. I. 
vol. 15 p. 39 ) establish that she was a daughter of Candragupta 
II. ( first quarter of 5th century A. D. ) of the Imperial Gupta 
dynasty and became the chief queen of the king Rudrasena II of 
the VSka^aka line. The Talagunda pillar inscription of the 
Kadamba king Kakusthavarman ( E. I. vol. 8 p. 24) recites that 



450 History of Dharma&astra [ Oh. IX 

the founder of the Kadamba family was Mayura^arman, a 
brahmana, who being exasperated with the Pallavas of KaiicI took 
up the sword. His descendants have names ending in varman (as 
ksatriyas should have, according to Manu II. 32 ). The inscrip- 
tion mentions that Kakusfchavarman ( who was 4th in descent 
from Mayurasurman ) got his daughters married to Gupta and 
other kings. In the Ghatofckaoa Inscription of Yasodharman 
and Visnavardhanu (A. S. W. I. vol. 4, p. 140 ) we are 
told that Soma, a brahmana and ancestor of HastibhojaÂ» 
minister of the Vaka^aka king Devasena, gave his heart to 
wives born in brahmana and ksatriya families, The Tip- 
perah copper-plate grant of a chieftain called Lokanatha 
( E. I. vol. 15, p. 301 Â£f ) dated in the 44th year ( probably of the 
Harsa era i. e. about 650 A. D.) says that Lokanatha* s ancestors 
belonged to the Bharadvaja gotra (p. 306) and that the 
maternal grand-father of Lokanatha was Ke6ava who is said to 
have been a parasava ( p. 307), while Kosava's father Vlra was a 
brahmana ( dvijasattama ). VirupadevI, a daughter of the 
famous Vijayanagara king Bukka I ( 1268-1298 A. D. ), was 
married to a brahmana named Brahma or Bomanna Wcdeya, 
who was the Governor of the Araga province ( E. I. vol. 15, p. 12 ). 
Vide also E. I. vol. 18, p. 87 ( dated 894 of the Vikrama era ) 
for Pratlhara kings being descended from a brahmana Hari- 
candra and the latter's ksatriya wife ; the Atpur Inscription of 
Saktikumara dated in samvat 1034 (977 A. D.) which states that 
the founder of the Guhila dynasty was a brahmana Guhadatta f 
whose descendant Bhartrpa^ta married a Rasfaaku^a princess. 

Classical Sanskrit Literature also yields certain well- 
known instances of inter-caste marriages. The MalavikSgnimitra 
of Kalidasa shows that Agnimitra, a son of Senapati Pusya- 
mitra of the Sunga dynasty and a brahmana, married Malavika" 
who was a ksatriya princess. In the Harsacarita of Bana 
(Ucchvasa I towards end) we are told by BSna himself that 
among the friends and companions of his wanderings there 
were his two parasava brothers Candrasena and Matrsena 
(i,o. step-brothers from a 6udra wife of his father). Rajatakhara, 
teacher of king Mahendrapala of Kanoj, says in his Karpiira- 
manjarl( 1. 11 ) that his accomplished wife Avantisundarl was 
descended from the Cahuana ( modern Chavan ) family ( i. e. 
from a ksatriya family ). 

It is extremely difficult to say when exactly inter-caste 
marriages even betwoen dvijatis came to be prohibited by the 



Ch. IX ] Inter-caste marriages 451 

smrtis and writers of digests. Visivarupa ,0M on Yaj. III. 283 
( not later than first half of 9th century ) olearly suggests that 
in his day a brahmana could marry a ksatriya girl. Medha- 
tithi on Manu III. 14 suggests that about 900 A. D. at the 
latest marriages of brahmanas with ksatriya and vaisya girls 
took place rarely in his day, but not with sudra women ; and 
the Mit. on Yaj. does not at all say that though marriages 
among dvijatis ( anuloma ones ) wore allowed by Manu and 
Yaj. they had entirely ceased fco be regarded as valid by its time. 
Many of the medieval digests and writers like the Sm. C. and 
Hemadri quote verses stated to be from the Aditya-purana or 
Brahma-purana on matters forbidden in the Kali age ( and 
so called Kalivarjya) among which inter-caste marriages are 
included. 

The Apastamba ,087 smrti (in verse ed. by Jivananda I, p. 549, 
chap. IX ) says that by marrying a girl of another caste a man 
incurred the sin of mahapafcaka and had to undergo the penance 
of 24 krcohras. The Markandeya-purana ( 113. 34-36 ) narrates 
the story of king Nabhaga who married a vaisya girl by the 
raksasa form of marriage and who consequently incurred sin. 

The state of the law as to inter-casfce marriages in British 
Indian courts may be briefly indicated here. By the Special 
Marriage Act ( III of 1872 as amended by Act XXX of 1923 ) 
both anuloma and pratiloma marriages are validated if they are 
registered and solemnized according to the procedure prescribed 
by the Act. But if a marriage is not so solemnized under 
that Act, but under the general rules of Hindu Law, then all 
pratiloma marriages are invalid throughout British India.

But anuloma m8 marriages have been recognised as valid by 
some High Courts in India; the Allahabad High Coiwt, howeven 
regards all anuloma marriages even as invalid. 

The next restriction that the girl to be married must not be 
a sapinda of the bride-groom has now to be considered. Sapinda 
relationship is of special importance in three matters, viz. 
marriage, inheritance and a6auca ,0fid ( impurity on birth and 
death). The prohibition against marriage with a sapinda girl 
applies to all varnas including the 6udra 107 Â°. There are two 
schools about the meaning of sapinda, one represented by 
the Mitak sara and the other by Jlmatavahana (author of the 
DayabhSga). Both are agreed that a sapinda girl cannot be 
married, but they differ as to the meaning of the word. We 
shall first understand one interpretation of sapinda. The locus 
classicus is the commentary of Vijnane&vara on Y&j. L 52-53 
a substantial portion of which is translated here: "'asapin- 
dam ' ( in Yfij. L 52 ) means a woman who is not a sapinda and 
sapinda means one who has the same pinda i. e. body (or particles 
of the body). Sapinda relationship (between two persons) 
arises from ( their ) being connected by having particles of the 
same body. Thus, the son has sapinda relationship with his 
father by reason of the ( fact that ) particles of the father's body 
continue in him ( the son ). Similarly ( there is sapinda rela- 
tionship ) with the paternal grandfather and the like ( of the

gr andson and the like ) because through his ( the grandson's ) 
father particles of the body of the grandfather continue in ( or 
are connected with) him (the grandson ). Similarly (the son has 
sapinda relationship ) with his* mother because particles of the 
mother's body continue in him. Thus (a person has sapinda 
relationship) with his mother's father through his mother; so 
( one has eapindata ) with one's mother's sister or mother's brother 
also by reason of the connection with (or continuity of) particles 
of the same body (viz. the body of the maternal grandfather). 
So also (a person has sapindata) with the paternal uncle, the 
paternal aunt and the like. Similarly the wife has sapinda 
relationship with the husband because she produces ( with the 
husband) one body (viz. their son). lo71 In the same way- 
brother's wives (are sapindas) of each other, because they produoe 
one body ( viz. their respective sons ) with their respective 
husbands who are produced from one body ( viz. their husbands' 
father ). In this manner wherever the word sapinda occurs, 
there one has to understand connection with ( or continuity of) 

1071 . The words ' fTOT mm *r$ *n**TT q qK 3lâ¬ K l * *rer3*n Â» are translated 
differently by Golap Chandra Sarkar in his ' Hindu Law Â» (7th ed. of 
1936 ) pp. 81-82 as * similarly arises the sapinda relationship of the 
husband with the lawfully wedded wife by reason of ( their together ) 
forming one body ' ( i. o. one person, hence the wife is called half the 
body of tho hu3band ). The learned author thinks that his translation 
is tho correct one and others wont wrong in translating as in the 
passage above. His translation cannot be accepted for several reasons. 
In tho first place, it is oppo3ed to tho explanation of the Bujambha^t' 
STTCWiIcr^ a^nrns^ <T<jr$tfft ^mwR^if^*?: (i. e. particles of the 
bodies of the husband and wife continue in or are concerned with one 
body, the son, that is produced by them both ). That husband and wife 
are one is a pleasant fiction but here Vijnffnedvara is stressing the 
physical continuity of particles. The husband and wife though said to 
be one are still two bodies. No ono says that their bodies become 
physically ono. Besides the objection that if they do not begot a son, 
the husband and wife will not bo sapindas is not sound. Rules and 
principles are laid down for generality of cases and regard is to be had 
to their capacity to produce a son. Tho foorV%*g ( HI. xrjsrn! p. 280 )

particles of the same body either direotly or mediately. 107 * 
On the word ' asapind&m ' it was explained that sapinda rela- 
tionship arises immediately or mediately by reason of the connec- 
tion with particles of the same body ; this may prove to be too 
wide a statement, since in this beginninglesssawsara,such a rela- 
tionship might exist in some way or other between all men ; ,073 
therefore ( the sage Yajnavalkya ) states * after the fifth on the 
mother's side and after the 7th on the father's side \ After the 
fifth on the mother's side i. e. in the mother's line and after the 
7th on the father's side i. e. in the father's line sapinda 

relationship ceases. These words ( viz. sapinda ceases ) are 

to be taken as understood ( in the text of Yaj. ). Therefore the 
word * sapinda * though it applies everywhere ( i. e. to a very 
wide circle of persons ) by the expressive ( i. e. literal ) power 
of its component parts, is restricted to a certain definite sphere, 
like the words * nirmanthya ' I074 and * pankaja \ And so the 
six ( ascendants ) beginning with the father and the six 
descendants beginning with the son and the man himself as 
the seventh ( in each case ) are sapindas ; wherever there is a 
divergence of the line, the counting shall be made until the 
seventh in descent is reached including him ( i, e. the ancestor ) 
from whom the line diverges ; in this way the computation is to 
be made everywhere. And so the fifth ( if a girl ), who stands 
in the fifth generation when a computation is made beginning 
with the mother and going up to her ( mother's ) father, mother's 
paternal grandfather &c,, is styled in an indirect way* fifth 

1072. There is direct continuity of particles of the bodies of the 
parents in the son and there is mediate connection of particles between 
grandparents and grandchildren and so on.

may apply to every water plant, but it is restricted by usage (rUdhi ) to 
a lotus plant i. e. the wide literal or etymological (yaugika ) meaning 
of the two parts * panka (mud) and ' ja ' ( springing from ) is restricted 
by popular usage to a single plant springing from mud. 'Nirmanthya* 
is the word used for producing fire by friction. Literally the word 
means * what is to bo churned '.

from the mother's side ' ( by Yaj. ). In the same way ' the seventh 
from the father's side' (in Yaj.).is she who is the seventh in degree 
(from an ancestor) when computation is made beginning from the 
father and proceeding up to the father's father and so on ". 

According to this explanation of the Mitaksara 1075 the 
following rules about prohibition based on sapindya follow : 
( 1 ) In computing degrees the common ancestor is to be 
included ; ( 2 ) regard is to be had to the father and mother of 
the bride and bridegroom both ; ( 3 ) if computation is made 
from the mother's side of either the proposed bride or bride- 
groom, they must be beyond the fifth degree ( i. e. they 
must be 6th or further on ) from the common ancestor 
and if it is made through the father of either, they must be 
beyond the seventh from the common ancestor ( i. e. they must 
be eighth &c. ). This last postulates four different classes of 
cases, viz. descent from a common ancestor may be traced 
through the fathers of both bride and bridegroom or through 
the mother of both, or through the mother of the bridegroom 
and the father of the bride or through the father of the bride- 
groom and the mother of the bride. The method of computing 
degrees is entirely different from the English method as is made 
clear by the remarks of the Mit. translated above. The rules 
require that both must be beyond sapinda relationship as 
defined and limited above. For example, tracing descent through 
the fathers of both bride and bridegroom, if the bride is 8th 
from the common ancestor ( called kutastha in dharmaÂ§astra 
works ) and the bridegroom is 6th, there can be no marriage, 
as though the bride is beyond the limits of sapinda relationship 
to the common ancestor, the bridegroom being 6th from the 
kutastha has sapinda relationship with the kutastha. These rules 
apply according to the Mit. only where the ancestors married 
women of their own varna. But if an anoestor married a 
brahmana girl and also a ksatriya girl and a question arose 
about the eligibility of marriage among descendants of these 
two wives, then prohibition based on sapinda relationship 
extends up to only three degrees ( and not seven or five ). ,078 Â°

456 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

It should not be supposed that these rules of the Mit. are 
universally observed. The texts themselves are in conflict. 
Further, the customs and usages as to prohibited degrees for 
marriage are so divergent in the various parts of India and 
among the hundreds of castes and sub-castes that it is impossible 
to state any rule as universally or even generally applicable. 
A few examples of conflict among the smrtis are cited by the 
Mit. itself. Vas. Dh. & ( 8. 2 ) says ' (he may marry ) the fifth 
on the mother's side and 7th on the father's side', while Yaj. as 
interpreted by the Mit. makes it necessary that the girl to be 
eligible must be 6th from the common ancestor traced through 
the mother and 8th when tracad through the father. Paithlnasi 
says ' the girl must be beyond tbree degrees on the mother's I078 
side and five degrees on the father's side '. These two are 
explained away by the Mit. by saying that these texts do not 
authorise a marriage with a girl who is distant from the common 
ancestor by a lesser number of degrees than those propounded 
by Yaj. but they only prohibit marriage with girls who are 
nearer in degrees than those stated in those texts. But this 
reconciliation of the conflict among the smrtis is not at all 
satisfactory. 

The following diagrams illustrate the application of the 
rules of sapinda relationship acoording to the Mitaksara. In 
all of them A represents the common ancestor and the letters 
S and D represent respectively sons and daughters. According 
to the Mit. computation has to be made from ( and inclusive of ) 
the common ancestor in all cases and both the bride and bride- 
groom have to be beyond the prohibited degrees. I07?

B(6) is beyond five degrees (traoing

within 7 degrees (traoiug descent

outside sapinda limits. 

All these four examples are taken from the Dharmasindhu

sapinda relationship by * frog's leap \ 1078 Just as a frog leaps 
from one spot to another leaving intervening objects untouched, 
so in this example No. 3, there is sapindya between D(5) and 
D(5), but S(6) and D(6) are left unaffected by sapindya ( as 
relationship is traced through the mothers of both), while 
sapindya reverts to affect D(7) and S(7). The maxim of 
' frog's leap * is a very ancient one, being exemplified by the 
Mahabhasya of Patanjali. 1079 

The rules about prohibition of marriage on the ground of 
sapinda relationship, particularly where cognates (persons 
connected through females) were concerned, have not been 
observed in numerous instances over wide areas from very 
ancient times. One striking illustration is the question whe- 
ther a man can marry his maternal unole's or his paternal 
aunt's daughter, particularly the former. On this point opinion 
has been sharply divided from ancient times. Ap. Db. S. I. 7. 
21. 8 includes among patanvja actions ( mortal sins ) sexual 
intercourse with the uterine relations ( mothers and sisters ) of 
one's parents and their children. This would prohibit marriage 
with one's maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter. Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 1080 1. 19-26 notes that there were five practices peculiar to 
the south viz. eating in the company of one whose upanayana 
has not been performed, to eat in the oompany of one's wife, to 
eat stale food, to marry the daughter of the maternal uncle or 
of a paternal aunt and there were five practices peculiar to the 
north. Then he proceeds to state the argument that those who 
follow the practices mentioned by him in countries other than 
those where they prevail incur sin, that Gautama (XL 20) holds 
this last argument to be wrong and then Baud, states bis own

view that one should pay no head to either set of practices, as 
both are opposed to srartis and the views of sis$as. From this it 
is dear that a marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter 
or paternal aunt's daughter was in vogue in the south ( below 
the Narmada probably) long before the Baud. Dh. S. (i. e. several 
centuries before the Christian era ) and that North India did 
not go in for such marriages and that orthodox sutra writers 
like Gautama and Baudhayana reprobated such practices. Manu 
(XL 172-173) forbids such marriages "on approaching ( for 
carnal intercourse) the daughter of one's father's sister or of 
one's mother's sister or of mother's full brother, a man 
must undergo the penance called c candrayana '. A wise man 
should not take as his wife ( any one of ) these; they are not fit 
to be wedded because they are (sapinda ) relatives, for by wedd- 
ing them one sinks low ( i. e. falls into hell or loses casfce)". 
Haradattaon Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 quotes a verse from 
Satatapa ,08! prescribing the penance of candrayana for marrying 
one's maternal uncle's daughter or a girl having the same gotra 
as one's mother's gotra ( i. e. maternal grandfather's gotra ) or a 
sapravara girl and a text of Sumantu forbidding marriage with 
the daughter of the brother of one's mother or step-mother. It 
would be seen that all these relatives are third from the common 
ancestor and so are very much within the prohibition against 
marrying a sapinda, whatever be the number of prohibited degrees 
for marriage that are accepted. Kumarila in his TantravSrtika 
while discussing the scope and validity of sadacara (on Jaimini 
1. 3.7 ) enumerates many lapses from good conducb attributed to 
great men and heroes of the past and tries to explain away 
those violations of good conduct. The charge brought against 
Vasudeva (Krsna) and Arjuna, the central heroes of the 
Mahabharata, is that they respectively married RukminI and 
Subhadra" who were their maternal uncle's daughters ( this being 
forbidden ). Kumarila makes very scathing remarks against this 
practice 1082 prevalent among southerners and then refutes this 
charge by saying that although in the Mahabharata (Adiparva 
219. 17-18 ) SubhadrS is described as the daughter of

Vasudeva and sister 108J of Krsna, she was really not 
so, but that she was Vasudeva's mother's sister's daughter 
or was the daughter's daughter of the sister of the 
father of Vasudeva's mother ( or step-mother RohinI ). 1084 
Kumarila argues that such female cousins one degree or 
several degrees removed are often spoken of as sisters. Vide 
my notes to the Vyavaharamayukha pp. 200-202 where 
this matter is fully explained. This reply of Kumarila well 
illustrates the method of dealing with inconvenient texts 
adopted by mlmamsakas like Kumarila when the texts run coun- 
ter to their cherished views. Visvarupa on Yaj. III. 254 quotes 
Manu XL 172 and verses of Samvarta prescribing the penance 
of Paraka for carnal intercourse with one's maternal uncle's 
daughter. 1085 Medhatithi on Manu II. 18 refers to this practice as 
prevalent in some countries, and says it is opposed to the rule of 
Gautama (IV. 3 ) about prohibition on the ground of sapindya 
and explains how such practices might have arisen. Persons 
making love to the handsome daughters of their maternal uncles 
married them for fear that they might otherwise be punished 
by the king ; it may be that others literally following the 
words of Manu IV. 178 held by the practice which their fore- 
fathers resorted to for fear of punishment. 1086 Among medieval 
writers, some condemn this practice, others justify it. AparSrka 
( pp. 82-84 ) after a lengthy discussion condemns marriage with 
maternal uncle's daughter. The Nirnayasindhu also does the 
same ( p. 286 ). 

Among those who support marriage with a maternal uncle's 
daughter the most prominent are the Sm. C. ( I. pp. 70-74 ) and 
the Par. M. ( I. 2. pp. 63-68 ). They both admit that there are

Oh. IX ] Marriage with maternal uncle's daughter 461 

passages of Manu, Satatapa, Sumantu (all quoted above) 
and others condemning marriage with a maternal uncle's 
daughter, yet they say that there are passages of the Veda 
and some smrtis in support of it and sis^as (learned and respect- 
able persons ) observe this practice and so such marriages 
are sadacara and not forbidden. They rely upon two 
Vedio passages ; one is from the Sat. Br. I. 8. 3. 6 ( S. B. E. 
vol. XII. p. 238 ) " thus the separation ( of the eater and the 
eaten ) is effected in one and the same act ; hence from one and 
the same man spring both the enjoyer ( the husband ) and the 
enjoyed ( the wife ); for now kinsfolk live sporting and rejoicing 
together saying ' in the fourth or third man ( generation ) we 
shall unite', And this is so in accordance with that (separa- 
tion of the spoons )." ,087 The mention of the union in the third 
generation is understood by the Sm. C. as referring to the 
marriage of a person with his maternal uncle's or paternal 
aunt's daughter. VisvaTiipa also refers to this passage ( on Y&j. 
1.53), but he does not draw the inference that such marriages are 
authorized by the Veda. Another Vedic verse is relied upon by 
the Sm. 0. and Par. M and other works. It is a verse from a 
Khila sukta ' Come, O Indra, by commended paths to this our 
sacrifice and partake of your portion. They ( the priests ) have 
offered the fat seasoned with ghee that is thy portion, as the 
maternal uncle's daughter or the paternal aunt's daughter (is 
one's lot in marriage J'. 1081 This verse is referred to by 
Visvarupa on Yaj.( I. 53 ) but his explanation of it is different 
viz. that it really indicates one out of four different alternatives

as regards prohibited degrees for marriage. 1089 AparSrka (p. 83) 
on Yaj. I. 53 reads the latter half somewhat differently and 
so interprets it as to spell out of it a prohibition against 
marrying a maternal uncle's daughter. This text is quoted in 
I. L. R. 7 Mad. 548 at p. 550. The Smrfcicandrika relies upon a 
passage of the CaturvirhsKtimata that allows a marriage of 
persons who are third or fourth in descent from a common 
ancestor on both sides ( on the mother's or father's side ). 
There is also a text of Brhaspati which prescribes that the 
practices of the countries, castes and families should be guarded 
( or enforced ) by the king as they have been in vogue from 
past times, otherwise the subjects become inflamed and among 
such practices he instances ' Brahmanas in the south marry the 
maternal uncle's daughter V 090 So there is smrti authority for 
such marriages. Besides southern sistas deeply read in the 
Vedas and acting according to the meaning of the Veda prac- 
tise marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter. Here both Sm. 
C. and Par. M. are on very firm ground. The Smrtimuktaphala 
of Vaidyanatha says 'among the Andhras sistas deeply read 
in the Vedas follow the practice of matidasuta-parinayana and 
among the Dravidas respectable people allow marriage of a 
person with a girl who is fourth in descent from the common 
ancestor 'J * 1 Among several castes in the Deccan and the 
Madras Presidency, not only is marriage with a maternal 
uncle's daughter allowed, but it is highly commended. Even 
certain br&hmana castes like the Desastha brahmanas of the 
Karnataka and Karhada brahmanas observe this practice in 
modern times. The Samskarakaustubha ( pp. 616-620 ) and the 
Dharmasindhu support matulasuta-parinayana. 

Both the Sm. G. and Par. M. say that though the Vedic 
passage from the Satapatha is a mere arthavada ( a laudatory 
statement ) in praise of a Vedic act, yet on the analogy of the 
words ' he holds ( the samidh ) above (the sruc) for gods ', which

are construed by Jaimini ( III. 4. 15 ) as a vidhi ( as a positive 
rule ) on account of fcheir apurvatva ( not being known from any 
other source ), these words of the Satapatha are also to be con- 
strued as a vidhi ( of the marriage with maternal uncles 
daughter). 1093 The Sm. C. also presses into service the Vedio 
verse ( Rg. X. 16. 5 ) addressed by Yaml to Yama. But that 
mantra does not clearly refer to cross-cousin marriages. 

The smrti passages that condemn cross-cousin marriages 
are explained in a peculiar manner by the Sm. C, and the Par. 
M. When a woman is married in one of the four forms, brahma 
&c, she passes into the gotra of her husband, becomes a sapinda 
in the husband's family and so she is severed from her father's 
family (as to gotra and sapinda relationship); but when a 
woman is married in tho asura, gandharva and other forms* 
she does not pass over into the gotra of her husband, but remains 
in the gotm of the father and her sapinda relationship with her 
father and brother continues. Therefore the Fon of such a woman, 
if he marries the daughter of his mother's brother, would be 
marrying a girl who is a sagotra and sapinda of bis mother. 
The Sm. C. and the Par. M. and other works say that the smrti 
texts forbidding marriage with maternal uncle's daughter refer 
to a person, whose mother was married in the g&ndharva, asura 
and the other two forms, but not to a person whose mother was 
married in the brahma and the three other approved forms. 
This is the reasoning of the Sm. C. and the Par. M. 1093 

1092. Jaimini's antra is fitful tmTO^ST^lli.4-15. This is not com- 
mented upon by Sabaia ; but the Tantiavartika, which notices tin's fact, 
assigns several reasons for thi3 omission and oxplains it as follows: in 
the JT$rf^R*T thcro is a passage 3TO*cTictff3tf qrT *rerg x f> f*nT 13* ^**ft t*IT-

Hero though tho particle 'hi* (showing reason) is employed and 
though tho present * dhSrayati ' is used ( and not tho potential as is

These rules about prohibition on the ground of sapinda 
relationship cause great difficulties in modern times, when 
owing to the rapid spread of co-education and the rise in the 
marriageable age of girls, love marriages have become some- 
what frequent. Lovers do not stop to consider such ( to them ) 
trivial matters as sapinda relationship, but the law is often 
inexorable. The narrowing of the limits of sapinda relationship 
is permitted by the authors of commentaries and digests only 
on the ground of immemorial family, caste or local usage. For 
example, the same authors, who hold that marriage with the 
maternal uncle's daughter is sanctioned by Vedic texts and 
custom, condemn and forbid marriage with one's paternal aunt's 
daughter or with one's maternal aunt's daughter ( vide below ). 
There are a few verses cited from the smrtis which favour the 
narrowing down of sapinda relationship. For example, the 
Caturvimsatimata 1093 * states * According to Sakatayana there 
is no blame in marrying a girl who is 7th or 6th or 5th ( from 
the common ancestor ) ; similarly Manu, Parasarya, Yama and 
Angiras say that one may marry a girl who is third or fourth 
(from the common ancestor) on both sides (i. e. from her father's 
side or mother's side ). Whoever enters into such marriage 
alliances by relying on the usage of his country or of his 
family is always entitled to associate with people and this is 
seen from the Veda '. Parasara ( as quoted in the Nirnayasindhu 
and other works ) says * a man who is himself fourth or fifth 
( from the common ancestor ) may according to ParSsara's view 
marry a girl who is 4th or 6th ( from the common ancestor ), but 
one who is himself fifth cannot marry a girl who is also fifth 
( from the common ancestor ).' The SarhskSrakaustubha, the 
Sapindyadlpika and a few digests hold these verses authorita- 
tive and allow such marriages provided they are in accordance 
with local or family usage. As against this the following facts 
have to be remembered. One of the maxims of interpretation 
is that where there is conflict between smrti texts, the preferable 
rule is to follow the opinion of the majority. 1 09Sb Gaut., Manu,

Yaj., Marlci and numerous other srartikaras are opposed to these 
dicta. The seoond rule is that Manu has the highest authority 
among smrtis and that smrti which is opposed to the dicta of 
Manu is not commended. 10930 The above passages are opposed 
to the words of Manu on sapinda relationship and about marry- 
ing a maternal uncle's daughter ( Manu V. 60, III. 5, XL 171- 
172). A third point about the above texts is that several 
eminent works like the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharmasindhu 10924 
hold that some of these verses are baseless and not genuine 
and that they really refer to persons adopted or persons des- 
cended from wives of different castes of the same common 
ancestor ; and lastly even those works that support such narrow- 
ing of sapinda relationship for marriage do not advocate it for 
all and sundry, but only where there is a local or family 
usage to that effect. Therefore, marriages among persons who 
are 3rd or 4th or 5th from the common ancestor cannot be 
regarded as valid in general, but only on the ground of usage. 
The following diagram will furnish some examples of the 
narrowing down of sapipda relationship.

Here ordinarily there can be no valid marriage between D (4) 
and S (4) or S (5) because they are both not beyond even the 
fifth degree from the common ancestor ; but if the verses of the 
Caturvimsatimata and Para&ara be followed the marriages are 
valid. It should be noted that even under the Special Marriage 
Act ( III of 1872 ) marriage between D (4) and S (4) or S (5)

will not be valid according to the 2nd proviso to sec. 2. 
The Nirnayasindhu 10926 was not prepared to concede that such 
marriages, though not th9 best, were at least allowable as 
inferior (anukalpa). The Dharmasindhu 1092 ' stated that only 
in calamities when one is unable to secure a girl one may 
enter into a marriage where sapinda relationship is narrowed 
down, but that those who can secure another girl should not go 
in for it, as the sin of incest would be incurred. Such marriages 
did not take place except during the last few years and so the 
courts have not yet pronounced on their validity. The preceding 
remarks are made by way of caution only and it is quite 
possible that courts may find out some way to uphold the 
marriages when they come before them many years after their 
celebration. But it is well to remember that the validity of 
such marriages in castes that have no usage to that effect is, to 
say the least, doubtful. 

There is a great l09 * deal of discussion in the smrfcis and 
nibandhas on the gotra of a woman. 5iv. gr. S. I. 8. 12 is 
interpreted by some as laying down that husband and wife 
become of one gotra one year after marriage. Laghu Harlta 
appears to refer to this and also proposes an option that she 
takes up the husband's gotra immediately after marriage. 
Yama 86 and Likhita 25 say that after marriage on the 4th 
night a bride becomes one with her husband as to gotra, pinda 
and aiauca ; while Yama 78 and Likhita 26 state that she loses 
her father's gotra on taking the seventh step. The Mit. on Yaj. 
I. 254 has a long note on this subject, states that there are two 
views and finally reaches the conclusion that a woman retains 
her father's gotra even after marriage for pindadana, if she was 
a putrika or was married in the asura and the following forms ; 
but if she was married in the brahma and other approved

forms, there was an option viz. pinda may be offered to one's 
mother by one's father's gotra or by her father's gotra according 
to family usage. Vide also Apararka pp. 432, 542, Sm. C. 
I. p. 69. 

Both of them allow a person's marriage with his paternal 
aunt's daughter. Certain inscriptions at Nagarjunikonda ( of 
about the 3rd century A. D.) establish that the king Siri Virapu- 
risadata, son of Siri Chantamula who had performed the 
Vajapeya, A6vamedha and other sacrifices, married a daughter 
of his paternal aunt ( E. I. vol. 20 at p. 4 ). There are other 
authors, however, who, while allowing marriage with a maternal 
uncle's daughter, disallow it with a paternal aunt's daughter. 
For example, the Nirnayasindhu says that, though it follows 
from the same Vedic passages that one's paternal aunt's 
daughter may be married, yet such a marriage should not be 
contracted as it is hateful to the people, as there are no other 
passages laying down the advisability of such marriages. 1095 
Similarly the Sm. 0. ( I. p. 71 ) and Par. M. ( I. 2. p. 65 ) say that 
though marriage with one's mother's sister or mother's sister's 
daughter also should be allowed on the same grounds as those 
urged in favour of the marriage with the maternal uncle's 
daughter, yet it is forbidden since it is condemned by Vistas and 
is hateful to the people and both again rely on Yaj. I. 156< 1095 

Another and a very striking instance of the limits of 
sapinda relationship not being observed is the practice among 
certain sections of even brahmanas ( such as some Desasthas in 
Karnataka and Mysore ) marrying their own sister's daughter 
( i. e. their own niece ). Vide Mandlik's Hindu Law p. 425. In 
Ramangavda v* Shivaji, the Bombay High Court held that 
marriage with one's sister's daughter was invalid among 
brahmanas ; but in that case no custom as to the validity of

such marriages was alleged 1097 . In Vellanki Ramakrishna v. 
Kotagiri Subbamma 43 Mad. 830 at p. 834 it is stated that in 
the Velama caste a man may marry his sister's daughter. 

On account of these divergences about the limits of prohi- 
bited degrees for marriage it appears that the remarks of the 
Sarhskarakaustubha ( p. 620 ) and of the Dharmasindhu ( p. 228 ) 
are most sensible and practical. They say that even in the 
Kali age ,098 those, in whose families or countries the limits of 
sapinda relationship are narrowed down and marriage with the 
maternal uncle's daughter has been in vogue for ages, may do 
so, that they incur no blame by such marriages, that others 
( among whom there is no such custom ) may without blame 
invite such persons for sraddhas and may take girls from their 
families in marriage and that the passages quoted by Hemadri 
forbidding thoir being invited at sraddhas only apply to those 
who marry a maternal uncle's daughter even though they have 
no such family or local usage. 1099 

Another question is how far sapinda relationship holds 
good in the case of girls belonging to the family from which 
one's step-mother comes. The Udvahatattva (p. 118), the 
Nirnayasindhu ( p. 289 ), the Sam. Pr. ( pp. 695-699 ), Sarhskara- 
Kaustubha (pp. 621-630) and the Dharmasindhu ( p. 230 ) deal 
with this matter. They all rely on a text of Sumantu ,,0 Â° * all 
the wives of one's father are mothers, the brothers of these are 
one's maternal uncles, their sisters are one's mother's sisters, the 
daughters of these are one's sisters and the children of these

latter are one's sister's children ; otherwise there would be 
samkara ( confusion ) \ Two interpretations are placed on this, 
one view ( and that is held by most ) is that this lays down 
sapindya only with the persons specifically mentioned, 1101 
while another view ( this is held by the Sam. Pr. ) is that there is 
sapindya for four generations from the father of one's step- 
mother. Acoording to the first view a man cannot marry the 
daughter or grand-daughter of his step-mother's brother or 
sister, but his own daughter can marry the son of his step- 
mother's brother; while according to the second view the latter 
marriage also would contravene the rule about this extension 
( atideia ) of sapindya. 

Marriages with certain girls were forbidden by certain 
writers on the ground of what is called * viruddhasambandha \ 
although there is no question of sapinda relationship in such 
cases. The Grhya-parisis^a 1102 (quoted in the Nirnayasindhu 
p. 289) prescribes 'one should marry a girl with whom there is no 
viruddhasambandha , e. g. the daughter of one's wife's sister or the 
sister of one's paternal uncle's wife (these should not be married), 
Viruddhasambandha ( incompatible relation ) occurs where the 
standing of the proposed bridegroom and the bride would 
resemble that of father or mother to the other ( or of brother and 
sister). In modern times such marriages take place as a matter 
of course and no court would declare them to be invalid. Vide 
I. L. R. 20 Mad. 283 and I. L, R. 43 Mad. 830 where marriage 
with one's wife's sister's daughter was held to be valid, among 
brahma^as as well as sudras in the Telugu and Tamil districts, 
relying on Mandlik's Hindu Law pp. 484-485 and other autho- 
rities. In Ramchandra v. Oopal 32 Bom. 619 at pp. 630-631 
the court approves of the decision in 20 Mad. 283 and holds that 
the dicta as to viruddha-sambandha are only recommendatory.

470 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

About the sapinda relationship of the adopted son as regards 
marriage, asauoa and sraddha a good deal is said in many works 
such as Sam. K. ( pp. 182-186 ), Nirnayasindhu ( pp. 290-291 ), the 
Vyavahararaayukha, the Sam. Pr. ( pp. 688-694 ), Sam. R. M. 
(pp. 453-456). Sapindya for asauca and sraddha will be dealt 
with later on. As to sapindya for marriage in the case of adoption 
there is great divergence of views. The Sam. Pr. ( p. 690 ) says 
that the son given in adoption has sapindya for seven genera- 
tions with his genitive father and for three generations with 
the adoptive father ( pp. 693-694 ). n Â° s The Sam. K. appears to 
hold, after quoting several views, that if the upanayana of the 
adopted boy was performed in the family of birth, then he has 
sapindya with the genitive family for seven generations. But 
if the ceremonies from jatakarma to upanayana are performed 
in the adoptive family then he has sapindya in the adoptive 
family for seven generations, but only for five generations if 
only upanayana is performed in the family of adoption. The 
Nirnayasindhu gives its own view that there is sapindya in 
both families for seven generations. The Vyavaharamayukha 
holds ( following Gautama IV. 3 ) that in the case of kevala 
dattaka ( the ordinary adopted son ) sapinda relationship 
* extends to seven degrees in the adoptive father's family and 
five degrees in the adoptive mother's family. 1104 The Dharma- 
sindhu follows the Sam. K. generally but it makes one 
significant remark. It says that several writers hold that 
in the case of dattaka, sapindya is to be observed for a lesser 
number of degrees (than seven or five) in both families. 1105 
The Sam. R. M. ( p. 454 ) says that the limits of sapindya spoken 
of as applying to an adopted person extend to his children 
also. 1106 As the limits of sapindya for marriage are very much 
narrowed down when marriage with one's maternal uncle's 
daughter or one's niece is allowed, on the other hand certain 
communities extend such limits too much. The Desastha 
brahmanas of the M&dhyandina 6akha in the Deccan do not

Ch. IX 1 Marriage in mother's original gotra i1% 

marry a girl whose father's gotra is the same as the gotra of the 
bridegroom's maternal grandfather. Manu III. 5 lays down 
' that girl who is not a sapi^da of the mother (of the bridegroom) 
and who is not a sagotra of the father ( of the bridegroom ) is 
commended in the case of twice-born classes \ Many com- 
mentators and digests like Kulluka, the Madana-parijata (p. 132), 
the Dipakalika, the Udvahatattva ( p. 107 ) understand the word 
asagotra ( in Manu III. 5 ) after * matuh * also, and thus forbid 
marriage with a girl whose gotra is the same as that of one's 
mother ( i. e. of one's maternal grandfather ). Medhatithi n07 on 
Manu III. 5 quotes a text of Vasis^ha which prescribss the 
penance of candrayana for marrying a girl who has the same 
gotra as the bridegroom's mother ( i. e. his mother's father ) and 
abandonment of her. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 
quotes a similar verse from SStatapa. Kulluka, the Sm. C. 
( I. p. 69 ), Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16, the Gr. R. 
( p. 10 ), Udvahatattva p. 107 and other digests quote a verse of 
Vyasa ' some do not desire for marriage a girl who has the 
same gotra as one's mother ; but one may marry without question 
( or fear ) a girl when her birth and name ( as connected 
with one's mother's original gotra ) are unknown \ A woman 
on marriage loses her original gotra and passes over into 
the gotra of her husband ; so the words * sagotra ' of the 
mother simply mean ' having the same gotra as one's 
mother once had in her maiden state '. The Sm. C. ( I. p. 
69 ) takes this verse to refer only to a woman who was 
made an appointed daughter ( putrika ) by her father. Hal5- 
yudha also held the same view. But other writers do not 
approve of this ( vide the Gr. R, p. 10 ). The Nirnayasindhu no8 
( III. purvardha p. 302 ) forbids marriage with a girl who is 
sagotra of one's mother, but the Sam. K. ( p. 693 ) and the 
Dharmasindhu both say, after quoting a text of Safcyasadha, that 
this restriction applies only to those who study the Madhyan- 
dina Sakha.

472 History of Dharmaictstra [ Cb. IX 

The Bengal school represented by the Dayabh&ga and 
Raghunandana differ from the MitaksarS in the interpretation 
of the word 'sapinda*. In this system the word 'pinda* is taken 
to mean 'the ball of rice' that is offered in &rÂ£ddhas to deceased 
ancestors &c. (while under the Mit. interpretation 'pinda* 
means body or particles of body ). Sapinda means ' one who is 
connected with another through oblations of food '. The author 
of the Dfiyabhaga propounds his theory with reference to inheri- 
tance and he himself says that with reference to SSauca ,109 
sapinda relationship is to be differently understood. Further 
Jlmutavahana does not set forth his theory of sapinda relation- 
ship with reference to marriage. His theory is that in matters 
of inheritance the guiding principle is the spiritual benefit ( upa- 
karakatva ) conferred on the deceased through oblations of food, 
and he relies on Manu ( IX. 106 ) for this proposition. For his 
sapinda theory he principally relies on two passages, Baud. 1110 
Dh. & I. 5. 113-115 and Manu IX. 186-187. Baudh5yana*s 
words are ' the paternal great-grand-father, the paternal grand- 
father, the father, the man himself, his full brothers, his son, 
grandson and son's son from a woman of the same varna: 
all these participating in undivided daya ( heritage ) are called 
sapindas. Those who participate in divided daya are called 
saJculyas. Thus issue of the body existing, wealth goes to them ; 
on failure of sapindas, the sakulyas \ The text of Manu ( IX. 
186-187) is 'To three, libations of water must be given; 
towards three pinda proceeds ; the fourth is the giver of these 
( of water and pindas ), there is no fifth properly (concerned in 
this). Whoever is the nearest among sapindas, his becomes 
the wealth of him (who dies). After him the sakulya be- 
comes (the heir) &c \ Jlmutavahana's explanation of this text 
is as follows : ' A man when living offers pindas to his three 
male ancestors ; but when he himself dies, his son performs

the sapindlkaravia uu sraddha for him, he is made one with the 
pitrs and he then begins to participate along with his father 
and grandfather in the three pindas offered by his son to the 
latter's three ancestors. Thus those to whom he offers pindas 
and those who offer pindas to him are called, since they share 
in undivided oblations, avibJiaktadayada sapindas.' Several 
objections can be raised against the theory of Jlmutavahana. 
In the first place he assigns the meaning of pinda to the word 
daya in Baudhayana's passage for which there is no warrant. 
Baudhayana really means that those enumerated by him are 
called sapindas who take undivided wealth i. e. who constitute 
an undivided family. In the nexfc place on his interpretation 
the word sapinda has to be interpreted in entirely different 
ways for asauca and marriage. Besides he himself is not sure 
of his ground, since he says that although learned men may not 
approve of his theory that spiritual benefit is the guiding

Hi History of Dharmaiastra { Ch. IX 

Srlkrsna, a commentator of the DayabhSga and author of 
Dayakramasarhgraha, and Raghunandana, author of Smrtitattva, 
and others elaborate these rules. The Full Bench of the 
Calcutta High Court in Guru Qovind Shaha Mandal 1U * v. 
Anand Lai Ghose Mazumdar gives an elaborate statement of the 
several sapindas. But as those rules have reference only to 
succession, they are passed over here. Raghunandana in his 
work on marriage called Udvahatattva 1114 quotes the famous 
verse of the Matsyapurana, * the fourth and ( two beyond him ) 
among ascendants are partakers of lepa ( the leavings of the 
boiled rice that become attached to the hand of him who offers 
pindas ), the father and the rest ( i. e. two more beyond him ) are 
partakers of the pinda ; he who offers the pinda to them is the 
seventh ; Bapindya extends to seven generations' and refers the 
readers to his Suddhitattva for elucidation. Raghunandana 
does not give any definition of sapindas for marriage, but 
discusses the conflict about the several texts such as * 7th on the 
father's side and 5th on the mother's side \ He expressly says 
( p. 110 of Udvahatattva ) that the words * who is not a sapinda 
of one's mother ' are still applicable even if several females 
intervene between the common ancestor and the girl proposed 
to be married. He then adds a special rule that descendants of 
what are called pitrbandhus and matrbandhus also are for- 
bidden if they are within 7 degrees and 5 degrees respectively 
from these bandhus. The pitrbandhus ni5 of a person are his 
paternal grand-father's sister's sons, his paternal grandmother's 
sister's sons and his father's maternal uncle's sons; while 
matrbandhus are a person's mother's father's sister's sons, 
mother's mother's sister's sons, mother's maternal uncle's sons, 
These two latter may be illustrated by two diagrams.

ancestor. So it will be seen that this goes far beyond the limits 
of sapindya generally prescribed and there is no valid reason

N. B.â Here SI, S2 and S3 are matrbandhus of the bride- 
groom. The maternal great-grandfather is the starting point in 
calculating prohibited degrees in the mother's paternal line. 
In the mother's maternal line the starting points are S2 and S3. 
In the ascending lines of the matrbandhus the descendants of 
only the common ancestor are excluded. For example, the girl 
descended from S3's maternal ancestors may be married by 
the bridegroom and so also a girl descended from the paternal 
ancestor of S2 or SI . 

Another rule propounded by Raghunandana is that even 
within prohibited degrees a valid marriage may be contracted 
if three gotras intervene. In the case of girls descended from 
pitrbandhus and matrbandhus the computation of gotra must 
be made from them. For want of space it is not thought 
advisable to illustrate this by citing several examples. But 
one example is given to illustrate this rule.

Here according to the Bengal school S (4) can marry D (4) 
because three gobras intervene between her and the common 
ancestor, although S4 is only 5th in descent from the common 
ancestor; for according to the Bengal school it is not necessary 
that both the bridegroom and the bride be beyond the limits of 
sapindaship, but only the bride need be so ; while according to 
many writers of the Mitaksara school both must be beyond the 
limits of sapindaship from the common ancestor, 1116

Ch. IX ] Sapinda relationship under Dayabhaga 477 

The Dayabhaga does not rely upon any Vedic passages for 
its theory of sapinda relationship. The Mifc. (on Yaj. I. 52) 
relies upon three Vedic passages only in propounding the theory 
of sapinda relationship viz. * indeed the man himself is born 
from himself ( as son, Ait. Br. 33. 1 ) * ; * thou art born again ( or 
reproduced ) in the offspring ' ( Tai. Br. I. 5. 5 ) and * this body is 
made of six kosas ( sheaths ) ; three are derived from the father, 
three from the mother ; bones, muscles and marrow from the 
mother' ( Garbhopanisad ). These passages at the most say that 
particles of the bodies of the parents continue in their offspring ; 
but they do not say anything about the meaning of sapinda or 
the limits of the sapinda relationship for marriage or in- 
heritance. Even in the Rg. the words jfiati and bandhu which 
occur in the dharmasutras ( e. g. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 10. 3, I. 5. 11 
17. and Gaut. II. 44, IV. 3 and 5, VI. 3 ) frequently occur ( vide 
Rg. VII. 55. 5 and X. 85. 28 for jfiati and $g. 1. 113. 2, V. 73. 4, 
VII. 72. 2, VII. 67. 9 for bandhu ). All that we can say is 
that both meanings of sapinda were implicit in the word pinda 
from the earliest times and that the sutra writers were 
conscious of both meanings. 

As to the grounds on which marriages between near 
sapindas were prohibited various theories have been advanced 
by anthropologists. Vide Westermarck in his ' History of 
Human marriage ' ( ed. of 1921, vol. II. pp. 71-81 ) and Rivers 
on * Marriage of cousins in India' in J. R. A. S. for 1907 pp. 
611-640. Some think that the prohibition was due to the 
abhorrence which men in the primitive times felt for incest. To 
me it appears more probable that in India at least the prohibition 
was due to two causes; firstly, the observed fact that, if near 
relatives marry, their defects are transmitted with aggravation 
to their offspring and secondly the fear that, if marriages 
between near relatives by blood were allowed, there may bo 
clandestine love affairs and consequent loss of morals and it 
would be difficult to secure husbands for girls who would

be living under the same roof with several near or distant 
cousins. 

The Par. M. I. part 2, p. 59 expressly says that only such a 
girl who is not a sapinda of the bridegroom within the prohi* 
bited degrees on any of the two theories of sapindya ( viz. by 
connection with particles of the body or with the balls of rice ) 
is eligible for marriage. 

The question what support Vedic Literature lends to the 
two interpretations of the word sapinda may now be briefly 
discussed here. 

The word pinda occurs ,,1T in the Rgveda (I. 162. 19) and 
the Tai. S. IV. 6, 9. 3 where it seems to mean 'a part of the body 
of the sacrificial animal thrown into fire as an offering \ Here 
it is clear that the word pinda is not used in the sense of * ball 
of rice \ But in the Tai. S. II. 3. 8. 2 and in the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2. 24 
the word pinda means *ball of rice* offered to the Manes. The 
Nirukta III. 4 and 5 twice employs the words ' pindadanaya ' 
(for offering balls of rice). But the word sapinda hardly ever 
occurs in the Vedic literature and we have no means of judging 
in what sense it was used in the Vedic literature. In the 
dbarmasutras the word sapinda occurs frequently and the 
dharmasutras show a close connection between offering pinda 
and the taking of inheritance ( vide Qaut. 14. 13, 28. 21, Ap. Dh. 
S. II. 6. 14. 2, Vasistha IV. 16-18, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 40). 

It was shown above (pp. 436-37 ) that some sages prohibit 
marriage with a sagotra girl while others prohibit it with a 
sapravara girl. A number of sages and works like Visnu Dh. 
S. 24. 9, Yaj. I. 53, Narada (strlpumsa, verse 7) require that the 
girl to be married must not ba a sagotra nor a sapravara. 
Therefore it is necassary to understand the meaning of gotra and 
pravara. A detailed treatment of the topics of gotra and pravara 
would extend to a large treatise. Only a few salient points 
can be gone into here. The subject of gotra and pravara in the 
Vedic Literature has been treated at length by me in the 
J. B. B. R. A. S. ( New series vol. II. for 1935 ). Only the 
conclusions there drawn will be set out here.

sagotva is equal to samana-gotra as stated by PSnini VI. 3.85 and 
sapinda and aapravara are similarly formed. 



Ch. IX ] Mart iage-meaning of gotta 479 

The word gotra in the Rg. means ' cow-stable ' or ' herd of 
cows â¢ in a few passages (I. 51. 3, II. 17. 1, III. 39. 4, III. 43. 7, 
IX. 86. 23, X. 48. 2, X. 120. 8 ). By a natural metaphor * gotra * 
was applied to a cloud (in which waters are pent up as cows in a 
cow-stable) or to a cloud demon and also to a mountain range or 
peak which conceals water-yielding clouds. Vide Rg. II. 23. 3 
(where Brbaspati's car is styled 'gotrabhid'), Rg. X 103. 7 (=Tai. 
S. IV. 6. 4. 2, Atharva-veda V. 2. 8. and Vaj. S. 17. 39 ), Rg. 
VI. 17. 2, X. 103. 6. In some of these verses it is possible to 
take ' gotra ' in the sense of ' fort \ In some cases ' gotra ' 
probably means only " assemblage ' ( samiiha ) e. g. Rg. II. 23. 
18, VI. 65. 5. From this last sense of ' assemblage * the transi- 
tion to the meaning of ' a group of persons * is both easy and 
quick. There is no positive instance of the word ' gotra ' 
being unchallengeably used in the sense ' descendants of a 
common patriarchal ancestor' in the Rgveda; but the concep- 
tion underlying the idea of gotra was, it is plain, quite familiar 
even in the age of the Rgveda. In the Atharvaveda V. 21. 3 1118 
the word ' viÂ£vagotryah * ( belonging to all families ) occurs. 
Here the word ' gotra * clearly means ' a group of men 
connected together ' ( by blood ). The Kau6ika sutra IV. 2 
quotes a mantra in which gotra undoubtedly means 'a group 
of persons'. 

Several passages of the Tai. S. show that descendants of 
great sages were called after those sages. In Tai. S. I. 8. 18. 1 
it is said * the Hotr is a Bbargava ' ( descendant of Bhrgu ). 
The commentator explains that this is so only in the Rajasuya. 
It is quite possible that in those days descent was traced through 
teacher and pupil as well as through father and son. But there 
being a very few occupations only it is most probable that the son 
generally learnt from his father the lore of the latter. In Tai. 
S. VII. 1. 9. 1 we read ' therefore one does not find (or know ) 
two Jamadagniyas (in succession) who are poor (or grey- 
haired ) \ From this it is clear that in the times of the Tai. 
S. Jamadagni was regarded as a very ancient sage, that several 
generations of Jamadagni's descendants had passed away by 
that time, that they were all known as Jamadagnyas (or-gniyas) 
and that no two descendants were found to be poor ( or grey- 
haired ) in succession.

480 History of Dharmasastra [ Ch. IX 

In numerous mantras of the Rgveda the descendants of 
well-known sages are denoted by the plural form of the names of 
those sages. In Rg. X. 66. 14 we read 4 the Vasisthas have raised 
their voices like their father \ In Rg. VI. 35. 5 the Bharad- 
vajas are referred to as Angirases. According to Asv. Srauta- 
sutra Bharadvaja is a gotra falling under the Arigirogana. In 
the Brahmana Literature there are ample indications that 
priestly families had come to be formed into several groups 
named after their ( real or supposed ) founders and that such 
families differed in details of worship according to the group 
they belonged to. The Tai. Br. ( 1. 1. 4 ) prescribes that the 
consecration (ddhctna ) of the sacred Vedic fires is to be performed 
for Bhrgus or Angirases with the mantra ' bhrgiinam ( or angi- 
rasam ) tvadevanam vratapate vratena-dadhami/ .that for other 
biahmanas with the words * adityanam tva devanam vratapate ' 
&c. The Tai. Br. II. 2. 3 speaks of the * AngirasI praja* ( people 
of the Angiras group). The Tandy a Brahmana n19 prescribes 
that the camasa ( cup ) made of udumbara was to be given as 
daksina to a sagotra brahmana.' The Kauslfcaki Br. n20 ( 25. 15 ) 
says that one who has performed the Visvajit sacrifice ( in 
which everything that the Eacrificer owned was gifted away ) 
should stay for a year with a brahmana of the same gotra. The 
Ait. Br. (30. 7 ) contains the story of Aitasa and his son 
Abhyagni and it is stated that the Aitasayanas Abhyagnis are 
the most sinful of the Aurvas. In the Kausltaki Br. where the 
same story occurs it is said that the Aitasayanas became 
lowest among Bhrgus, as they were cursed by their father. 
According to Baudhayanasrauta-Butra the Aitasayanas are 
a sub-section of Bbrgugana. Sunahsepa, when he was accepted 
as a son by Visvamitra, came to be called Devarata and the 
Ait. Br. ( 33. 5 ) says that the Kapileyas and Babhravas were 
affiliated to Devarata. According to Baud, srauta-sutra Devarata 
and Babhru are Bub-sections of Visvamitra gotra. Sunahsepa 
is said to have been an Afigirasa by birth ( Ait. Br. 33. 5 ). 1121 So 
this makes it clear that gotra relationship was by birth in the 
times of the Ait. Br. ( and not from teacher to pupil ). In the 
Upanisads the sages when expounding the knowledge of brahma

Ch. IX ] Marriage-meaning of gotra 481 

addressed their pupils by the gotra names e. g. by the Bhara- 
dvaja, Gargya, Asvalayana, Bhargava and Katyayana gotras 
in Pra6na 1. 1, Vaiyaghrapadya and Gautama in Chandogya 
V. 14. 1 and V. 16. 1; Gautama and Bharadvaja, Visvamitra and 
Jamadagni, Vasistha and Ka&yapa in Br. Up. II. 2. 4. All this 
shows that the system of gotras with several sub-sections was 
well established in the times of the Brahmanas and the ancient 
Upanisads. But the gotras are in these works referred to in 
connection with sacrifices or education. There is hardly any 
distinct reference in these to gotra or sagotra in relation to 
marriage. In the Latyayana-sraufca-sutra 1,M VIII. 2. 8 and 10 
it is prescribed that one who has given away everything in the 
ViSvajit sacrifice should stay three nights with nisadas and 
may partake of their jungle diet and then again three nights 
with 'jam * and then the sutra gives several views about the 
meaning of 'jana' one of which, that of Dhananjapya, is that 
'jana' means a person with whom ( i. e. with whose daughter) 
marriage is possible while one who is sagotra is called ' samana* 
jana\ This clearly proves that long before the Latyayana- 
srautasutra marriage with a sagotra had been forbidden. 
Besides several of the grhya and dharma sutras prohibit 
marriage with a sagotra girl. It is impossible to hold that this 
was a new conception that arose only about the time of these 
sutras. Therefore, it must be supposed that prohibition as to 
sameness of gotra in marriage had its origin long before the 
period of the sutras in the times of the Brahmana works ( if 
not earlier). 

Gotra was of supreme importance in several fundamental 
matters and it largely entered into several practices of the 
ancient Aryans. A few examples may be given here. (1) In 
marriage sagotra girls were forbidden, vide above pp. 436-37. In 
the Lajahoma at marriage two offerings were to be made by all 
except Jamadagnyas, who had to make three ( Asv. gr. I. 7. 8-9 ). 

(2) In matters of inheritance the wealth of one dying 
without issue went to his near sagotras ( Gaut. 28. 19 ). 

(3) In sraddha the brahmanas to be invited ^hould not 
belong as far as possible to the same gotra as the person invi- 
ting ( Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 4, Gaut. 15. 20 ).

(4) In jmrvaya sthallpaka and other pakayajnas, all were 
to cub off oblations from the middle and fore-half of the havis % 
but for Jamadagnyas ( who are pancavaltins ) they were to be 
cut off from the middle, the fore-part and the hind part ( vide 
Asv. gr. 1. 10. 18-19 ). un 

(5) In offering water to a preta ( a person recently dead ) 
his gotra and name were to be repeated ( Asv. gr. IV. 4. 10 ). 

(6) In the caula ceremony tufts of hair were to be left 
in accordance with the gotra and practice of the family 
( Khadira gr. II. 3. 30 ). 

(7) At the time of performing one's daily samdhya prayer, 
one has to repeat even in modern times one's gotra and pravara, 
the Vedasakha and sutra which one studies. 

As regards srauta sacrifices a few interesting examples may 
be given. Jaimini establishes that sattras ( sacrificial sessions 
extending over 12 days and more ) could be performed only by 
brahmanas and that among brahmanas the Bhrgus, Sunakas 
and Vasisthas are not entitled to perform them ( VI. 6. 24-26 ). 
Those of the Atri, Vadhryasva, Vasistha, Vaisya ( Vainya ? ), 
Saunaka, Kanva, Kasyapa and Samkrti gotras took Narasarhsa 
as the second prayaja % while others took Tanunapat as the 
second ( vide Sahara on Jaimini VI. 6. 1 ). 

The conception of pravara is closely interwoven with that 
of gotra from very ancient times. The two have to be studied 
together. i Pravara ' literally means * choosing ' or ' invoking * 
( pi-arthana ). 1124 As Agni was invoked to carry the offerings of 
a sacrificer to the gods by taking the names of the illustrious 
rs's ( his remote ancestors ) who in former times had invoked 
Agni, the word pravara came to denote one or more illustrious 
rsis, ancestors of a sacrificer. A synonym of pravara is arseya 
or arsa ( as in Yaj, I. 52 ). Pravara entered into several domestic 
ceremonies and practices according to the grhya and dharma 
sutras. For example : 

(1) a bride was to be chosen whose father's pravara 
was not the same as that of the bridegroom's father. Vide 
above p. 437.

(2) In upanayana the girdle (mekJiala) was fco have one, 
three or five knots according to the number of rsis constituting 
the boy's pravara (vide San. gr. II. 2 ). 

(3) In Caula the tufts of hair to be left on the head 
depended on the number of sages constituting the pravara of 
the boy's family ( Ap. gr. 16. 6 ). 

The mass of material on gotra and pravara in the siibras, 
the puranas and digests is so vast and so full of contradictions 
that it is almost an impossible task to reduce it to order and 
coherence. The learned author of the Pravara-manjarl ( which 
is the leading work on the subject) wrote in despair 'Here, in 
the parts of sutras that have been quoted there is a great diver- 
gence in the order ( of the names of pravaras ) of the texts of 
the several sutrakaras, this being specially so in the text of 
Asvalayana ( srauta )-sutra. Thus, though divergence is clearly 
established, yet following the order of the texts of the majority 
of writers such as Baudhayana, Apastamba and Katyayana we 
shall declare (the rules ) about marriage or no marriage'. n25 

We have first to understand what gotra in the sutras and 
digests means and how it is inter-related to pravara. Among 
the sutras that treat of gotra and pravara the srauta sutras of 
Asvalayana (Uttarasatka VI, khandas 10-15), Apastamba 
( 24th prasna ) and Baudhayana ( B. I. ed. vol. Ill pravaradhyaya 
at end ) are the most important. The Pravaramanjarl ( p. 5 ) has 
a verse to the effect that Baudhayana's pravaradhyaya is the 
best on the subjeot. 

The Srautasutra of Satyasadha Hiranyakesi (21st prasna) 
has a section on this subject, which is the same as Apastam- 
basrauta with a few omissions and variations. The Baudha- 
yanasrauta-sufcra says 1126 ' Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja, 
Gautama, Atri, Vasistha and Kasyapa are the seven sages and 
Agastya is the eighth; the progeny of these eight sages is 
declared to be gotra '. These seven sages are probably derived 
from what is stated in the Br. Up. II. 2. 3-4 ( =Sat. Br.

XIV. 5. 2. 6 ) where these very seven sages are enumerated as 
those intended in the Aloka ' arvag-bilascamasa 1187 &c. * quoted 
there. The same work X Baud, srauta ) states that there are 
thousands, tens of thousands and arbudas ( millions of millions ) 
of gotras, but the pravaras are only 49. Besides the sutra works, 
some puranas like the Matsya (chap. 195-202), the V5yu (chap. 
88 and 99, Anan. ed. ), Skanda III. 2 ( Dharmaranya kanda ) 
contain elaborate enumerations of gotras and pravaras. The 
Mahabharata sets out at length the subdivisions (such as Madhuc - 
chandas, Devarata) of Visvamitragotra in Anusasanaparva 
4. 49-59. Digests like the SmrtyartbasSra ( pp. 14-17 ), the 
Sam. Pr. (pp. 59L-680), the Sam. K. (pp. 637-692), the Nirnaya- 
sindhu, the Dharmasindhu, the BalambhattI contain a vast 
material on this topic. There are also special works like the 
Pravaramanjarl on this topic. The general conception about 
gofcra is that it denotes all persons who trace descent in an 
unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. When a 
person says * I am Jamadagni-gotra â¢ he means that he traces 
his descent from the ancient sage Jamadagni by unbroken 
male descent. As stated by Baud, cited above, from very 
ancient times these male founders were supposed to be eight. 
This enumeration of eight primary gotras seems to have 
been known to Panini. Patanjali says ' there were eighty 
thousand sages who observed celibacy. The accepted opinion 
is that the spread of progeny was due to eight sages includ- 
ing Agastya. The offspring ( apatya ) of these eight are 
gotras and others than these are called gotravayava\ m8 Pacini 

1127. Vide Nirukta XII. 38 for another interpretation of tbe verse 
3raft5*Tt5**flOT &c. In the Nirukta * the seven sages ' are explained either 
as ' seven rays of the Sun ' or as * the seven indriyas \ The Br. Up. 
explains the 'seven sages* as the prffnas (the two ears, eyes, the two 
holes of the nose and the tongue ) and identifies them with the seven 
sages, VidvBmitra and others. The Atharva-veda X. 8. 9 reads the verso 
as * firff?TOÂ«mr &c.i.

Oh. IX ] Marriage-meaning of gotra 485 

defines gotra for grammatical purposes as 'apatyam pautra- 
prabhrti gotram* (IV. 1. 162), which means 'the word gotra 
denotes ( in my work on grammar ) the progeny ( of a sage ) 
beginning with the son's son \ For example, the son of Garga 
would be called Gargi, but the grandson would be called 
Gargyah and the plural Gargah would denote all descendants of 
Garga (downwards from Garga' s grand-son). But this definition 
is a technical one in grammar and is meant to indicate how 
derived ( taddhita ) words are to be formed by means of termina- 
tions. Even Panini makes use of this technical sense only in 
the apatyadhikara % but elsewhere in his work he uses the word 
gotra in the popular sense as comprehending all descendants 
of a common male ancestor. Vide the Kasika on Panini II 
4. 63, IV. 2. 39 and IV. 3. 80. The Sam Pr. (pp. 591-592) 
lucidly explains n89 this. That a man belongs to a particular 
gotra is known by him only from tradition, from his father 
and other elders or from people about him, just as he knows 
that he is a brahmaua from the same source ,13 Â°. Medhatithi on 
Manu III. 5. 194 has a very lucid and interesting discussion on 
this topic. His argument is : just as, though all persons are men, 
some are called brahmanas, so among brahmanas certain persons 
are known by immemorial usage (or convention) as belonging to 
certain gotras like Vasistha and the sutra-karas lay down that a 
certain gotra has certain pravaras; so the word gotra is applied 
to Vasistha and other sages by rudhi (by convention or 
long-standing usage ). It cannot be supposed that a person 
called Parasara was born at a certain time and then his 
descendants came to be called Par&saras. In that case 
the Veda would not be anadi ( beginningless ), as it is sup- 
posed to be, since it mentions Parasara, Vasistha &c. So gotra 
is anadi like the brahmaria caste and the Veda. The word is 
also secondarily used to denote a person, who is very illustrious 
on account of his learning, wealth, valour or generosity,

who thereby gives a name to his descendants and then becomes 
the founder of the family. This is laukika gotra. But this 
is not the meaning of gofcras which brahmanas have. The 
secondary meaning may apply to the word gofcra when used it. 
the case of ksatriyasV 131 The Mit. on Yaj. I. 53 says ' gotra is 
that which is known from tradition handed down in the 
family.' ,IW Each gofcra is associated with one, two, three or five 
sages ( but never four or more than five ) that constitute the 
pravara of that gotra. 1132 The gotras are arranged in groups, e. g. 
there are according to the Aivalayana-srauta-sutra four sub- 
divisions of the Vasistha gana, viz. Upamanyu, Parasara, Kundina 
and Vasistha ( other than the first three ). Each of these four 
again has numerous sub-sections, each being called gotra. So 
the arrangement is first into ganas, then into paksas, then into 
individual gotras. The first has survived in the Bhrgu and 
Angirasa gana. According to Baud, the principal eight gotras 
were divided into paksas. The pravara of Upamanyu is 
Vasistha, Bharadvasu, Indrapramada ; the pravara of the 
Parasara gotra is Vasistha, Saktya, Parasarya ; the pravara of 
the Kundina gofcra is Vasistha, Maitravaruna, Kaundinya and 
the pravara of Vasisthas other than these three is simply 
Vasistha. It is therefore that some define pravara as ' the group 
of sages that distinguishes the founder ( lit. the Btarter ) of one 
gotra from another \ 112 * 

Though the word pravara does not occur in the Rgveda, 
the word * arseya ' occurs therein and the system of pravara 
goes back almost to the Rgveda. Rg. IX. 97. 51 has * thereby 
may we acquire wealth and arseya resembling Jamadagni's.' 
Sometimes the idea of invoking Agni is conveyed without using

Ch. IX J Meaning of arseya or pravara 487 

the word pravara or arseya. In Rg. VIII. 102. 4 ll28 it is said 
4 1 invoke Agni just as Aurva, Bbrgu and Apnav&na did/ It is 
remarkable that these are three of the five pravara sages of the 
Vatsa-Bhrgus according to Baud. (3). Rg. 1. 45. 3 has 4 Jatavedas 
( Agni ), give heed to the summons of Praskanva, as in the case 
of Priyamedha, Atri, Virupa and Angiras/ m Â® In Rg. VII. 18.21 
it is said * they who from house to house gladdened thee, 
being desirous of thee, viz. Parasara, Satayatu and Vasis^ba, 
will not forget the friendship of a liberal patron (like thee)\ 1187 
It deserves to be noted that this mantra mentions Parasara (who 
in later mythology is the grandson of Vasistha and son of Sakti), 
Satayatu ( who is Sakti according to Sayana ), and Vasistha. 
Parasara, Sakti and Vasistha constitute the pravara of Parasara 
gotra ( according to Asv. and Baud ). In the Atharvaveda 
( XI. 1. 16, XL 1.25,26, 32,33,35, XII. 4. 2 and 12, XVI. 8.12-13 ) 
arseya means * descendants of sages or those who are related to 
sages \ In the Tai. S. both arseya and pravara occur in the sense 
of the sutras. In the Tai. S. II. 5. 8. 7 ( which refers to the recita- 
tion of the SamidhenI verses) we read "he says *cboose(or invoke) 
ye the fire called havyavahina ' ; he chooses him ( the fire ) of the 
gods ; he chooses the arseya ; in so doing he does not depart 
from the relationship ( by blood ) and doing so serves for conti- 
nuity. He chooses the later ones beginning from the remoter 
ones ". In this passage ' arseyam ' appears to be used in the 
sense of ' one or more illustrious ancestors of the sacrificer ' and 
reference is made to one of the two modes of mentioning the 
sages constituting the pravara. * Arseya* may also be taken here 
as an adjective (qualifying Agni), the meaning being 4 he invokes 
Agni by the names of the illustrious ancestor sages of the 
yajamana \ In one mode the remotest ancestor is named first 
in a taddhita ( derivative ) formation, then his descendant and 
so on, the sage nearest the sacrificer being mentioned last. For 
example, the pravara of Bbrgu Vatsa is 'Bhargava-cyavana- 
apnavanaurva-jamadagnyeti \ This method is employed by the 
Hotr priest when he invokes fire as the divine Hotr with the 
pravara-mantra * Agne mahan-asi brahmana bharata deveddha

Asv. Sr. I. 2. 27-L 3. 6 ). In the other mode the affix * vat* is 
used after the name of each pravara sage and the remotest one is 
mentioned last ( e. g. Jamadagnivat, Urvavat, Apnavanavat, 
Cyavanavat, Bhrguvat). This mode is employed by the adhvaryu 
when he chooses the Hotr priest. ,1W The Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 9 
appears to refer to one ( i. e. 2nd ) mode. The Kausltaki 
brahmana explains the purpose of taking the names of ancestors 
* as the gods do not partake of the offering of him 
who has no list of (illustrious) ancestors, therefore he pro- 
nounces the ftrseya of the sacrificer.' The Ait. Br. ( 34. 7 ) has 
an interesting passage on pravara. When a brahmana is 
initiated for a sacrifice, that fact is announced in these words 
' a brahmana has been initiated for a sacrifice.* How is the 
initiation of the ksatriya to be announoed ? The reply of the 
Ait. Br. is * even in the case of the ksatriya the announcement is 
to be in the same form (viz. a brahmana has been initiated) ; 
but with the pravara of the family priest. Therefore they 
should proclaim the ksatriya's initiation as a sacrificer with 
the Srseya of his family priest and should invoke Agni with 
the pravara of his family priest.' ,139 The Asv. Sr. (Uttara 
satka VI. 15. 4-5 ) and Baud. Sr. ( pravaraprasna 54 ) say that 
in the case of ksatriyas and vaisyas the pravara of their 
purohita was to be employed or the pravara ' Manava-Aila- 
Paururavasa ' or simply * Manuvar.' The origin of that rule is 
to be found in the above passage of the Ait. Br. There is 
another similar passage in the Ait. Br. ( 35. 5 ). The Sat. Br. 

1138. This rule is stated in Ip. &rauta (24. 5. 8) and Baud. Srauta

(II. 5. 7. 8) and by the 6at. Br. I. 4. 2.. 2-5. Agni is styled by rsi names 
such as BhUrgava, Cyavana &c. because fire was kindled by these ancient 
sages and oblations were thrown into it by them. Tire Adhvaryu recites

Ob. IX ] Marriage-gotra and pramra 481 

I. 4. 2. 3-4 mo shows that the illustrious ancestors to be invoked 
were supposed to be related as father and son and not by 
apostolic succession. 

The Mahabharata says that the original gotras were onlj 
four viz. Angiras, Kasyapa, Vasistha, Bhrgu. 1U1 The verse* 
are rather abruptly introduced in the epic and there is nothing 
to show on what this statement was based and it appears that i 
is due to the imagination of the writer. Baud, as shown abov< 
states that the original gotras are eight. But it is remarkable 
that Bhrgu and Angiras (whose divisions and sub-divisions are 
many) are not included by him in these eight. Therefore.it 
appears that even Baudhayana is not correctly stating the 
number of original gotras. Gautama and Bharadvaja are stated 
to be two out of the original eight, but both of them instead of 
being separately dealt with are grouped under the comprehensive 
Angirasagana. So even Baud, is not to be implicitly followed. The 
Balambhat^I mentions eighteen principal gotras (eight as in Baud, 
plus ten more some of which are names of mythical kings U48 ). 
Baud, himself says that there are millions of gotras and in the 
Baud. Pravaradhyaya there are over 500 names of gotra and 
pravara sages; while the Pravaram an jarl quotes a verse that 'there 
are three crores of them 1U3 and so the gotra system is difficult to 
comprehend \ and it mentions about 5000 gotras. Therefore, as 
the Smrtyarthasara says the nibandhas endeavour to place the 
innumerable gotras under groups and distribute them among 
49 pravaras (mentioned by Baud.) 1144 . Some idea of these

gotras and their distribution among the pravaras is given 
below. The appendix under note No. 1144 collects together 
the 49 pravara groups. 

The Bhrgugana and the Angirogana are very extensive. The 
Bhrgus are of two sorts, Jamadagnya and non-Jamadagnya. The 
Jamadagnya Bhrgus are again towfold, Vatsas and Bidas ( or 
Vidas ) ; the non-Jamadagnya Bhrgus are fivefold viz. Arstisenas, 
Yaskas, Mitrayus, Vainyas and Sunakas ( these latter five are 
called kevala Bhrgus). Under each of these sub-divisions there 
are many gotras, on the names and number of which the sutra- 
karas are not agreed. The pravara of Jamadagnya Vatsas is con- 
stituted by five sages according to Baud, and by three according to 
Katyayana. The pravara of the Bidas and the Arstisenas also has 
five sages. ms These three ( viz. Vatsas, Bidas and Arstisenas ) 
are styled pancavattin (Baud. 5) and they cannot inter-marry ( the 
reason will be explained below ). The five non-Jamadagnya 
Bhrgus have each of them numerous sub-divisions. These 
divisions of Bhrgus are given here according to Baud. Ap. has 
only six of them ( and not seven as he excludes Bidas from this 
group). According to Katyayana, Bhrgus have twelve sub- 
divisions ( vide Sam. Pr. p. 625 ). 

The Angirogana has three divisions, Gautamas, Bhara- 
dvajas and kevalangirases ; out of whom Gautamas have seven 
sub-divisions, Bharadvajas have four ( Rauksayanas, Gargas, 
Kapis and Kevala-Bharadvajas ), and Kevala-Angirases have 
six sub-divisions and each of these again is sub-divided into 
numerous gotras. This is according to Baud. Other sutrakaras 
differ as to the subdivisions. Atri ( one of the eight primary 
gotras ) is subdivided into four ( Atris proper, Vadbhutakas, 
Gavisthiras, Mudgalas ). Visvamitra is sub-divided into ten, 
which are further subdivided into 72 gotras. Kasyapas are sub- 
divided into Kasyapas.Nidhruvas, Rebhas, and Sandilas. Vasistha 
has four sub-divisions ( Vasisthas with one pravara only, 
Kundinas, Uparnanyus and Parasaras ) which are further sub- 
divided into 105 gotras. Agastya has three sub-divisions 
( Agastyas, Somavahas and Yajiiavahas ), the first of which is 
further sub-divided into twenty gotras.

Ch. IX ] Marriages-sagotra and sapravara 491 

When it is said that marriage with a sagotra or a sapravara 
girl is forbidden, each of these is separately an obstacle to 
marriage. Therefore, a girl, though not sapravara* may be yet 
sagotra and so ineligible for marriage or though not sagotra may 
yet be sapravara and not eligible. For example, the gotras of 
Yaska, Vadhula, Mauna, Mauka are different, yet a marriage bet- 
ween persons belonging to these gotras is not possible, because the 
pravara of all these is the same, viz. *Bhargava-Vaitahavya-Save- 
tasa-iti'. 1146 So also though the gotras Samkrfci, PutimSsa, Tandi, 
Sambu and Samgava are different, there can be no marriage bet- 
ween them as the pravara is the same, viz. 'Angirasa, Gaurivlta, 
Samkrtya ' ( aco. to Asv. Srauta ). When ifc is said that samana- 
pravaras cannot marry, sameness may be due to only one sage 
being the same in the pravaras of two gotras or there may be 
two or three or more sages that are common. The general rule 
is that if even one sage is the same 1147 in the pravaras of two 
different gotras, then they are sapravara, except in the case of 
the Bbrgu group and the group of Angirases. In these two 
latter unless there are at least three sages common ( when the 
pravara is constituted by five sages ) or at least two sages are 
common ( when pravara consists of only three sages ), there is 
no sapravaratva and no bar to marriage. Ifc will be noticed that 
among the five pravara sages of the Vatsas, Bidas and Arsti- 
senas quoted above there are three sages that are common and 
so they cannot inter-marry. 

Though the vast majority of gotras have three pravara 
sages, a few have only one pravara sage or two sages or five. 
Those who have only one sage are Mitrayus ( pravara Vadhrya- 
6va according to Asv.), the Vasisthas ( other than Kundina, 
Parasara and Upamanyu) have only one pravara Vasistha, 
the Sunakas have one pravara Grfcsamada (according to Asv.) 
or Saunaka or Garfcsamada (according to Baud. 9); the Agastis 
have one pravara Agasfcya (according to Ap. Sr. 24. 10.9); 
Asv. optionally allows three pravaras to Mitrayus ( Bhargava- 
Daivodasa-Vadhryasva ) and to Sunakas ( viz. Bhargava-

Saunahotra-Gartsamada ) and Ap. also allows to Agastis three 
pravaras ( Viz. Agastya-Dardhacyuta-Aidmavaha-iti ). Accord- 
ing to Ap. and the puranas, DhSpayantas have two pravaras 
( Vaisvamitra-Paurana-iti ), Astakas Lohitas have two ( Vaisva- 
mitra-Astaka iti ), and Sandilas also have two ( Daivala-Asita 
iti ). But he says that according to some the latter have three 
pravaras also ( KSsypa-Daivala-Asita-iti ), while Baudhayana 
gives four optional groups of three sages each for Sandilas 
( Baud. 43 ). For Vari-Dhapayantas Asv. prescribes three only 
( VaiSvamitra-Devarata-Paurana ) and also for the Astakas. 
According to Baud, the Vatsas, Bidas and ATstfsenas ( among 
the Bhrgus ) have five pravara sages ; so also among Angirases, 
the Kaumandas, Dlrghatamasas, Rauksayanas and Gargas have 
five pravara sages, though the last have optionally three also. 

The Ap. sr. ,148 ( 24. 5 6) says 'the sages to be invoked 
were to be three and they were to be seers of mantras \ It is 
therefore that the number of pravara sages is limited ; there 
was no such requirement for a gotra and so gotras multiplied 
to an unlimited extent. 

There are certain families that are dvigotras (i. e. have two 
gotras). Asv. uses the word 'dvipravacanah' for them 1149 . 
They are principally three viz. Saunga-saisiris, Sarhkrfcis and 
Laugaksis. From a Sunga, a sub-division of Bharadvaja gotra, 
was born a son to the wife of a Saisiri, a sub-division of Visva- 
mifcra (by niyoya); the son, therefore, came to be called Saunga- 
Saisiri. Therefore Saunga-Saisiris cannot marry in both 
Bharadvaja and Visvamitra gotras. Their pravaras are given 
below I15 Â°. They have to select one pravara sage from one gotra 
and two from the other gotra or two from the first and three 
from the other. A pravara of four sages is not allowed nor of 
one beyond five. For the other dvigotras, the Sam. K. (pp. 682- 
686 ), Nirnayasindhu p. 300 ff. may be consulted. In the case 
of the adopted son also, on the analogy of the 6aunga-saisiris,

both gotras and the pravaras of both gotras have to be considered 
and the dictum of Manu ( IX. 142 ) that ' the son given does not 
share the gotra and inheritance of the genitive father and the 
svadha (6raddhas etc.) of the giver ceases', is restricted only to 
matters of inheritance, sraddha and the like and does not apply 
to marriage. 1151 

A few words must be said about the gotra and pravara of 
kings and other ksatriyas. It appears from the Ait.Br. quoted above 
(p. 488) that in the case of ksatriyas the pravara of their purohita 
was employed in religious acts where pravara had to be recited. 
This leads to the inference that most ksatriyas had forgotten 
their gotras and pravaras by that time. The Srauta sutras 
allow 1152 an option to ksatriyas (to kings according to Aiv. ). 
'They may employ the pravara of their purohitas or all ksatriyas 
may employ the same pravara viz. Manava-Aila-Paururavasa- 
iti\ Medhatithi on Manu III. 5 states that the distinctions of 
gotras and pravaras concern primarily brahmanas alone and 
not ksatriyas and vaisyas and quotes ASv. Sr. (I. 3) in support. 
The Mit. and ether nibandhakaras rely on the first alternative 
mentioned in the sutras and say that in marriages of ksatriyas 
and vaisyas the gotras and pravaras of their purohitas should 
be considered, as they have no specific gotras of their own m3 . 
This is carrying the doctrine of atidesa ( extension ) too far or 
with a vengeance. The Sam. K. (pp. 689-690) assigns reasons for 
this attitude of tho Mit. but they are not satisfactory. Ancient 
literature and epigraphic records show that kings had gotras of 
their own. In the Mahabharata it is said that when Yudhisthira,

went to the court of Virata in the guise of a brahmana and was 
asked by the king to state his gotra he said that he was of the 
Vaiyaghrapadya gotra ( Virata-parva 7. 8-12 ). That this was 
the gotra of the Pandavas also follows *from the fact that in 
the Bhlsmatarpana ,154 that is performed on the eighth day of the 
bright half of Magha, Bhlsma's gotra is given as Vaiya- 
ghrapada or-padya and pravara as Samkrti. Jaimini (VI. 6. 
12-15 ) establishes that the Kulayayajfia was to be perform- 
ed jointly by a king and his purohita ( and so they could 
use different pravaras it appears). The Pallavas of KaiicI 
had Bharadvaja as their gotra ( vide E. I. vol. I p. 5 ). 
The Calukyas are often described as ' manavya-gotra ' ( vide 
E. I. vol. VI. p. 337 ). In a copper-plate grant of Jayacan- 
dradeva ( dated samvat 1233 i. e. 1176 A. D. ) the donee 
was a ksatriya described as Rauta-srl-Rajyadbaravarman of 
the Vatsa gotra and of five pravaras viz, Bhargava-Cyavana- 
Apnavana-Aurva-Jamadagnya. 1155 In the Garra (Bundelkhand) 
plate of the Candella king Trailokyavarma of Kalanjara a 
village is granted to Rauta Samanta of the Bharadvaja gotra 
in recognition of his father's death in battle with the Turuskas 
( E. I. vol. 16, p. 274 ). 

In many inscriptions and copper-plate grants hundreds of 
donees with their gotras and pravaras occur and ifc would be 
an interesting study to compare the latter with the material 
derived from the sutras and nibandhas. For example, vide E. I. 
vol. 19, pp. 115-117 and 248-250 for about 205 donees and their 
gotras in the plates of Bhaskaravariuan, E. I. vol. 14, p. 202ff 
( 500 donees with gotras in the time of Candradeva Gahadavala, 
sanivat 1150 ), E. I. vol. 13 p. 237, E. I. vol. 8 pp. 316-317 
( sake 1346 ), E. I. vol. 9 p. 103 (32 donees with gotras, pravaras, 
sakhas &c. ), E. I. vol 12 pp. 163-167 ( 120 donees with gotras, 
sake 1508 ), Gupta Ins. No. 55 Chammak plate of Pravarasena 
&c. Even the Buddhists kept the system of gotras ( vide E. I. 
vol, 10, Luder's list, No. 158 ). 

According to Ap. Sr. the vaisyas had 1156 a single pravara 
* Vafcsapra \ while according to Baud, they had three, viz.

Bhalandana-Vatsapra-Manktila \ They could also employ the 
pravara of their purohitas. The Sam. Pr. (p. 659) says that 
Bhalandana is the gotra of vaisyas. 

If a person does nob know his own gotra and pravara he 
should take those of his acarya ( teacher of Veda ), according to 
Ap. 1157 Though he takes his teacher's gofcra, it is only the teacher's 
daughter that is forbidden to him in marriage and not other girls 
of the same gotra as the acarya's. Both Sam. K. and Sam. Pr. 
( p. 650 ) quote a verse that when one does not know one's gotra 
one should call oneself of Kasyapa gotra. This is so when he 
does not know even his teacher's gotra. The Sm. G. ( sraddha 
section p. 481) says that this is so even when one does not know 
the gotra of one's maternal grand-father (i.e. he should offer pinda 
with Kasyapa gotra to his maternal grand-father ). 

The word gotra also came to mean any family name 
( surname ). In the inscriptions we find this usage very often. 
For example, in the Bannahalli plate of the Kadamba king 
Krsnavarma II ( E. I, vol. VI, p. 18 ) a sresthin ( a merchant ) 
is said to have been of the Tu^hiyalla gotra and pravara. The 
Reddi king ( a sudra ) Allaya Vema of Rajahmundry was said 
to have been of the Polvola gotra ( E. I. vol, XIII. p. 237, of 
iake 1356 ). 

A few interesting matters about pravaras are noted below. 
It is noteworthy that even as to the same gotra, there is great 
divergence among the sutrakaras about the sages constituting 
the pravara e. g. as to Sandilyagofcra. Asv. gives two groups of 
the sages f Sandila-Asita-Daivala-iti' or * Kasyapa- Asita- Dai vala- 
iti \ but Ap. states his own view that there are only two sages 
in the pravara viz. ' Daivala- Asita iti ' and that some say 
they are three, Kasyapa-Daivala-Asita-iti ; while Baud, states 
four groups, * Kasyapa-Avatsara-Daivala-iti, Kasyapa-Ayatsara- 
Asita-iti; Sandila-Asita-Daivala-iti; Kasyapa- Avatsara-Sand Ha- 
iti.' No adequate reasons can be given why even at so early an 
age as the sutras, not only the order of the names in the pravara, 
but the very names in the pravara and their number should have 
varied so muoh. Baud. ,158 (pravarSdhyaya sec, 44) notes that

the Laugaksis (or Laukaksis) are Vasisthasby day and Kasya- 
pas by night and their pravaras also show this double relation- 
ship. The Smrtyarthasara says that this picturesque description 
of them has reference to the prayajas and the like i, e. by day 
they follow the procedure of prayajas peculiar to Vasisthas and 
by night that peculiar to the Kasyapas. 

Among the gotras there are names of mythical ksafcriyas 
and kings like Vltahavya and Vainya and among the names of 
pravara sages many legendary kings like Mandhatr, Ambarisa, 
Yuvanasva, Divodasa appear. Vltahavya figures even in the 
Rgveda as closely connected with the Bhrgus (Rg. VI. 15. 2-3 ). 
In the Mahabharata it is narrated that Vltahavya, being a 
king, attacked Divodasa, whose son Pratardana pursued Vlta- 
havya, whereupon Vltahavya took shelter with Bhrgu and that 
when Pratardana asked Bhrgu whether there was any ksatriya 
in the hermitage, Bhrgu replied that there were all brahmanas 
and that by this Vltahavya became -a brahmana ( Anusasana 
chap. 30 ). 

Similarly the pravara of the Harltas is either Angirasa- 
Ambarlsa-Yauvanasva-iti or Mandhatr- Ambarlsa-Yaiivanasva- 
iti. These are mythical royal Bages. Among 1,5J> the Bhrgus is 
a sub-division called Vainya which is further subdivided into 
Parthas and Baskalas. The story of Prthu who milked the 
earth is well-known ( Drona-parva 69 ) ; he is called ' adiraja ' 
in Anusasana 166. 55. The Vayupurana in several places 
narrates that some ksatriyas became the pravaras of brahmanas. 
Vide chap. 88. 72-79, (about Visnuvrddha, 1180 who was 
descended from Purukutsa, whose son was Trasadasyu ), chap. 
88. 6-7, 92. 6, 99. 158-161, 99. 169-170 ( Anan. od. ) for other 
examples 1161 . How and why ksatriya names were adopted as 
brahmanical pravaras is obscure and difficult to understand. 
If one may hazard a guess, it is probably due to the fact that the 
puranas retain very ancient traditions of times when there were 
no water-tight varnas and that ancient kings were learned in the

Vedic lore and maintained srauta fires al&o, became famous as 
Bages in whose name fire was to bo invoked to carry offerings to 
Gods oven by brahmanas who came ages after them. 

The connection of gotra and pravara may bo stated thus: 
Gotra is the latest ancestor or one of the latest ancestors of a 
person by whose name his family has been known for genera- 
tions ; while pravara is constituted by the sage or sages who 
lived in the remotest past, who were most illustrious and who 
are generally the ancestors of the gotra sages or in some cases 
the remotest ancestor alone. 

It has been seen (pp.437-38) that marriage between parties that 
are sagotra or sapravara is no marriage and the woman does not 
become the man's wife. What were the consequences of such a 
void union? Baud. 1163 (pravcradhyaya 54) says that if a man has 
intercourse with a sagotra girl he should undergo the penance 
of candrayana, after that he should not abandon the woman, 
but should only maintain her as if she were a mother or a sister ; 
if a child is born it does not incur sin and it should take the 
gotra of Kasyapa. Apararka quotes (p. 80) Sumantu and another 
smrti to the effect that if a person inadvertently marries a 
sagotra or samana-pravara woman he should give up intercourse 
with her, should maintain her and undergo candrayana. 1 l6S But 
if he knowingly marries a sagotra or sapravara girl the penance 
was heavier ( viz. that for incest ) and if he has intercourse 
with her or begets a child from her he loses his caste and the 
child will be a candala 1164 . The rule of Baud, that there would 
be no blemish and the child will be of Kasyapa gotra is restricted 
to inadvertently marrying such a girl. 1165 The Sam. Pr. quotes a 
verse of Katyayana to the effect that if a marriage is gone

through with a sagotra, the girl may be again given in marriage 
to another. But the Sam. Pj. gets rid of that inconvenient text 
by saying that it does not apply to the present age. So the poor 
girl for no fault of hers had to pass her whole life in enforced 
celibacy, being neither an unmarried woman nor a widow. 11 * 6 

Questions about the validity of sagotra or sapravara 
marriages have not yet come before the courts ; but it is likely 
that in the near future courts will have to deal with such cases. 
If a marriage takes place under the Special Marriage Act of 1872 
(as amended in 1923) no difficulty will arise; but recently 
several marriages have been celebrated under the old Gastric 
procedure between persons who are sagotra or sapravara. Upon 
the strict letter of the dharmasasfcra texts such marriages are 
absolutely void. But it seems that the legislature should 
intervene and declare sagotra and sapravara marriages valid. 
Whatever may have been the case thousands of years ago when 
there were no means of communication and when there were 
small communities, the prohibition of sagotra relationship had 
some plausibility and real feeling of close kinship about it ; 
but now the prohibition has become meaningless. A man from 
Kashmir may marry a girl from Madras and the parents of 
both may have the same gotra. Granting for argument that the 
gotra sage was a common ancestor, one does not know how many 
generations have intervened between that remote ancestor and 
the intending spouses and particles of the ancestor's body, if 
they have survived at all in the intending spouses of the same 
gotra, must be in the present generation in the most attenuated 
state. The prohibitions based upon gotra and pravara are said 
by orthodox people to be prescribed upon unseen (adrsta) 
grounds and so they argue that they must be held to be absolute 
and not admitting of any evasion by any one calling himself a 
Vedic Hindu. One may be permitted to reply to these people that 
when almost every-body has given up the ancient cult of the 
srauta and grhya fires and when hundreds of other innovations 
in ancient practices have been accepted without demur, there is 
hardly any justification for sticking to this one remnant of 
ancient practices. As a matter of fact many brahmanas now 
do not remember their pravara themselves but have to be told by 
the priests what their pravara is. Certain prohibitions against

Ch. IX ] Marnage-Sagotra relationship 490 

marriage between near sapinda relations may be respected on 
account of their universal acceptance. Even theSpeoial Marriage 
Act ot 1872 prescribes that tbere can be no marriage between 
parties when they trace descent to a common ancestor who is 
the great-grandfather or great-grandmother (or who is nearer 
even than these ) of any one of them. 

Sagotra relationship is in one direction wider than sapinda 
relationship and narrower than it in another so far as marriage 
is concerned. A man cannot marry the daughter of any sagotra, 
however distant the sagotra may be. Similarly even an adopted 
man cannot marry the daughter of a sagotra of his genitive 
father for two reasons, firstly because, though on adoption he 
becomes severed from his natural family for inheritance 
and offering of pinda ( vide Manu IX. 142 ), his other rela- 
tionships with the natural family remain intact ; and secondly 
because Manu ( III. 5 ) says that the girl must not be a sagotra 
of the bridegroom's father ( and so even if by adoption a man 
goes into another gotra, it is the father's gotra that is to be 
considered ). Sapinda relationship prohibiting marriage extends 
only to seven or five generations, but prohibitions on the ground 
of sagotra relationship extend to any number of generations. 
On the other hand sapindas may be either of the same gotra( i. e. 
sagotra) or of a different gotra ( i.e. bhinnagobra). Thus up to a 
certain limit sapindas include both sagotras and bhinnagotras. 
The latter are called bandhus by the Mit. ; they are all cognate 
relations and have an important place in inheritance. We have 
seen (p. 436â37) that sagotra marriages were totally forbidden in 
the siifcras ( in the srauta sutras like Latyayana srauta and 
in grhya and dharma sutras). A passage of the Sat. Br. ( quoted 
above at p. 461) is relied upon by Professors Macdonell and Keith 
( Vedic Index vol. I. p. 236 ) for holding that marriages within 
the third and fourth degrees on both maternal and paternal sides 
were allowed in the days of the Satapatha and that therefore 
a man could marry in those days his paternal uncle's daughter. 
This latter is a startling proposition. The passage in the Sat. 
Br. is no doubt expressed in general words ( 'one may be united 
in the third or fourth generation*). But that passage is gene- 
rally applicable even if only a marriage with a maternal uncle's 
daughter or paternal aunt's daughter is meant. The passage 
does not expressly allow paternal cousins' marriages. The 
dharma-sutras prohibit sagotra marriages. Both the learned 
Professors, as most western scholars do, probably hold that 



500 History of Lharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

the Satapatha is not separated from the sutras by more 
than a few centuries. If a paternal uncle's daughter had 
been eligible for marriage in the times of the Satapatha, 
but became forbidden in the times of the sutras we shall 
have to suppose that an usage died out from one end of the 
country to another and an opposite usage became prevalent 
throughout within a few centuries. The smrfcis are not afraid of 
stating ancient practices which they themselves do not accept 
(i.e. niyoga). The smrtis do not say that marriages with 
paternal uncle's daughters were ever allowed anywhere. So 
it appears that the Satapatha is not referring to marriage with 
paternal uncle's daughter, but to marriage with maternal 
uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter. It must however be 
pointed out that Apararka (pp. 15. 63), the Sm. C. ( I. p. 12 ), 
Par. M. I. part 1 p. 133 and other digests quote a passage from 
the Brahmapurana l167 that sagotra and sapinda marriages are 
forbidden in the Kali age. It may be argued with some force 
that this implies that sagotra marriages once took place. But 
there are various ways of explaining this. It is possible that 
in the purana the word gotra is not used in the technical sense, 
but only in the sense of family or surname. Among sudras 
there is no gotra in the strict sense, but they also do 
not marry a girl who is believed to be of the same family, 
though the exact relationships or generations are not known. 
Besides it has been shown above that if a woman was a putrika 
or married in the Gandharva or Asura form she retained the 
gotra of her father and the son of the putrika would have the 
gotra of his maternal grand-father and yet being of a different 
family his marriage with the daugther of a sagotra of the 
maternal grand-father might have taken place in ancient times 
and was forbidden in the Kali age by the purana. Similarly 
the implied reference to marriages of sapindas as taking place 
in former ages has probably marriage wifch maternal uncle's 
daughter in view. When in the kalivarjya texts it is said * these 
dharmas are declared to be prohibited by the eages in the Kali 
age ' ( vide Vyavahara-mayukha p. 242 ), it is not proper to 
argue that everyone of the practices forbidden in the kali age 
was valid in former ages. All that is meant seems to be that 
most of them were allowed in former ages and these along with 
others enumerated are not to be practised in the Kali age, just

' chafcrino gacchanti ' ( here go persons wifch umbrellas ). 

There are certain other prohibitions about marriage. The 
Smrtimukfcaphala ms quotes a verse of Harlfca that one should 
not give one's daughter in exchange to another's son and 
receive that other's daughter in marriage for one's son, one 
should not give two daughters to the same man (at the same 
time), nor should one give one's two daughters to two persons 
who are brothers. But these dicta will now certainly be held as 
merely recommendatory. Besides there is no objection in India 
in modern times to marrying the deceased wife's sister, though 
even in England the deceased wife's sister could not be married 
until 1907 ( when the Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act, 
1907, Edw. 7 chap. 47 legalised such marriages). 

The next question is as to who have power to arrange for 
the marriage of a girl and to give her away. The Visnu Dh. S. 
(24.38-39) specifies the order of persons who are entitled to 
exercise this right of guardianship in marriage ' the father, the 
paternal grand-father, a brother, a kinsman, a maternal grand- 
father and the mother are the persons, by whom the girl may 
be given away in marriage. In the absence of the preceding 
one (the right) devolves upon the next in order, in case he is 
able'. Yaj. (1.63-64) gives a slightly different order viz. he 
omits the maternal grand-father and adds that the right can be 
exercised only when the guardian is not affected by lunacy and 
similar defects and that in the absence of these the girl should 
perform svayamvara ( i. e. choose a husband herself). Narada" 8 *

(strlpurhsa verses 20-22) gives the order as father, brother 
( with father's consent ), paternal grand-father, maternal uncle, 
agnates, cognates, mother (if sound in mind and body), then 
distant relation?, then the maiden may perform svayarhvara with 
the king's permission. To give away a girl in marriage was not 
only a right but was rather a heavy responsibility, as (Yaj. 
I. 64) and others declare that if a girl is not got married by the 
guardian at the proper time the latter incurs the sin of the 
murder of an embryo. The practice of svayamvara is well known 
from the Ramayana and the Mahabharafca, but it was confined 
mostly to the princely families. Manu (IX. 90-91) required a 
girl to wait for three years after she became marriageable before 
she could choose her husband herself. But Visnu Dh. S. 24. 40 
says that a girl should wait only for three monthly periods 
after she attains puberty and that after that period she has full 
power to dispose of herself in marriage as she thinks best. 

There are no rules in the smrtis as to who is to arrange the 
marriage of a male, since in ancient times they did not contem- 
plate the marriages of minor males. 

The mother has been put low in the order of guardians 
probably because of the dependent status assigned to women 
and because of the fact that in the ceremony of kanyadana she 
cannot personally engage but has to get it done through some 
male relative. The courts in modern India, however, have held 
that the mother is entitled to select a husband for her daughter 
even when the girl's paternal grand- father is living, though the 
actual gift may be made by a male. Vide Bai Ramkore v. 
Jamnadas, I. L. R. 37 Bom. 18, where Yaj. I. 63 is interpreted 
as only laying down who are to make a gift of the girl and as 
not intended to take away altogether the mother's right of 
selecting a bridegroom in favour of even distant relations. Vide 
also Indi v. Ohania ( I. L. R. 1 Lahore 146 ), Jawani v. Mula Ram 
( I. L. R. 3 Lahore 29, where it was held that, after the father, 
the mother of a girl has the preferential right to select a bride- 
groom for her and that she is under no obligation to consult 
the girl's paternal kindred such as a paternal uncle ), Ranga- 
naiki v. Ramanuja I. L. R. 35 Mad. 728, ( where all the 
authorities are examined). The Dharmasindhu states the 
important proposition that when the girl performs svayamvara 
or when the mother is to give away the girl in marriage, the 
girl or mother should perform the Nandisraddha and the princi- 
pal samkalpa is to be pronounced by her and the rest of the 



Ch. IX ] Guardians for Marriage 503 

rite is to be performed through a brahmana. 1170 Narada states 
the general rule that if anything is done by one who is afflicted 
with lunacy or similar defects, what he does is as if not done. 
So a marriage settled even by the father if he is a lunatic need 
not be performed. 1171 If an unauthorized person (like a maternal 
uncle ) were to give away a girl in marriage though her father 
is alive and fit, what is the result ? The digests state 1171 * that if 
the marriage has been completed by the performance of saptapadi, 
it cannot be set aside merely on the ground of the want of 
authority in the giver, since marriage rites are the principal 
matter and the authority to give is a very subsidiary matter, 
the absence of which cannot affect the principal matter. But 
before the marriage takes place a person who wants to give 
away a girl, though persons better qualified exist, can be 
prevented from doing so. Courts in modern India have 
followed these rules, relying on the doctrine of 'factum valet 
quod fieri non debuit ' ( what ought not to be done when done is 
valid) and holding that when once a marriage is duly solemn- 
ized and is otherwise valid, it is not rendered invalid because 
it was brought about without the consent of the proper guardian 
for marriage or in contravention of an express order of the 
court. Vide Khushalchand v. Bai Mani (I. L. R. 11 Bombay 247) 
and Bai Diwali v. Moti ( I. L. R. 22 Bom. 509 ). 

A few words must be said about the sale of girls in 
marriage. We read in the Maitrayanlya S. I. 10. 11 * she 
indeed commits falsehood ( or sin ) who being purchased by her 
husband roams about with other males.' ,178 There is another 
passage of the Veda relied upon along with the above by 
the purvapaksa ( the plausible view-point ) in Jaimini 
( VI. 1. 10-11 ) which denies that women have a right to

take pari; in Vedic sacrifices, viz. 'one should give to the 
daughter's father a hundred ( cows ) plus a chariot/ Jaimini 
replies ( VI. 1. 15 ) that the giving of a hundred with a chariot 
is not for purchasing a bride, but it is only a duty and 
a hundred must be offered as a present ( whether the girl is 
beautiful or not ). 1,7S This shows that, even if some girls wore 
purchased for marriage in the times of the Maitrayanlya S., 
there was a popular revulsion of sentiment about this practice 
and the sale of girls was severely condemned by the time of 
the sutrakaras. The Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 6. 13. 10-11 ) also makes 
interesting remarks on this point m * " there is no gift and the 
incidents of purchase about one's children ; in marriage the 
gift ordained by Veda to be made to the daughter's father in 
the words ' therefore one should give a hundred ( cows ) besides 
a chariot to tha girl's father and that ( gift ) should be made to 
belong to the ( married ) couple ' is due to the desire ( of the 
father to give a status to the daughter and her sons ) and is 
meant as a fulfilment of duty ( and not as a sale transaction ). 
The word * purchase ' applied to such a transaction is merely 
figurative, since the relationship ( as husband and wife ) arises 
( not from the so called purchase but ) from dharma" Vas. 
Dh. S. ( I. 36-37 ) quotes the two passages of the Veda ( from 
Mait. S. and the other about the gift of one hundred cows ) in 
support of the Manusa (i.e. Asura) form of marriage. The 
Nirukta VI. 9 n " while explaining ftg. I. 109. 2 ( * O Indra and 
Agni, I have heard you to be greater donors than a partially 
fit son-in-law or a brother-in-law ' ) remarks that " the word 
4 vijamata ' means among the southerners the husband of a 
woman who is purchased ; what is meant is that he is a

bridegroom who is deficient and not endowed with all good 
qualities." So Yaska implies that in the south girls were sold 
for substantial sums of money to persons who ( either because 
they were old or wanting in some qualities desirable in a good 
bridegroom ) were therefore really deficient as bridegrooms. 
In the Nirukta ( III. 4 ) while discussing the several views 
about the obscure verse of the Rgveda III 31. 1 ( sasad-vahnir 
&c. ) one of the reasons assigned for the view that women do 
not inherit is that gift, sale and abandonment in the case 
of women exist, but not in the case of men, to which some 
reply that these ( gift, sale &o. ) can be made of males also as 
is seen in the story of Sunahsepa ( in the Ait. Br. 33, Tai S. 
V. 2. 1. 3, Tai. Br. I. 7. 10. ). 

These passages lead to the inference that in ancient times 
girls were sometimes purchased for marriage, as was the case in 
many other countries. But gradually public feeling entirely 
changed and not only was the sale of daughters by the father or 
brother severely condemned, but even taking of presents by them 
was looked down upon. Ap. Dh. S. has already been quoted 
above (note 1174). The Baud. Dh. S. (L 11. 20-21) im quotes 
two veTses ' that woman who is purchased with wealth is not 
declared to be a legally wedded wife (apatni); she is not (to 
be associated with the husband ) in rites for the gods or manes 
and Kasyapa declares that she is a dasi ( slave girl ). Those, who, 
blinded by greed, give their daughters in marriage for a fee 
( hdka), are sinners, sellers of their own selves and perpetrators 
of great sin and they fall into hell &c. ' In another placo Baud, 
says ' he who gives his daughter (in marriage) by sale (as a 
chattel) sells his merit (punya)\ Manu (III. 51, 54-55) 
strikes 1177 a tender note about daughters when he says 'a father 
should not take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; if 
he takes a gratuity through greed he becomes the seller of his 
child; when relations do not take for themselves wealth given 
by the bridegroom as gratuity (but hand it over to the girl) 
there is no sale ( of the girl ) ; the wealth so taken is for

honouring the maidens and is only taken from the bridegroom 
out of loving concern for them. Fathers, brothers, husbands and 
brothers-in-law desiring their own welfare should honour women 
and should give them ornaments \ Manu (IX. 98) further recom- 
mends that 4 even a sudra should not take a gratuity when giving 
his daughter ( in marriage ), since in taking a gratuity he clan- 
destinely sells his daughter \ Yaj. III. 236, Manu XL 61 
include the sale of children among upapatakas. The Maha- 
bharata ( Anusasana 93. 133 and 94. 3 ) condemns the taking 
of a gratuity for giving a girl and Anusasana ( 45. 18-19 ) 
speaks of gathas of Yama contained in dharma-sastras ' who- 
ever sells his son for a price, or gives a daughter for the sake 
of his own liveli-hood in return for a gratuity, would fall into 
a most horrible hell called Kalasutra'. Verse 23 of the same 
chapter says ' even a stranger cannot be sold, what of one's 
own children'. Verse 20 ( = Manu III. 53 ) condemns even the 
arsa form of marriage as a sale because a pair of cattle is therein 
taken by the girl's father. In Kerala or Malabar it is believed 
that the great teacher Samkara laid down 64 acaras, among which 
are prohibition of the sale of girls, prohibition of salt &c. Vide 
I. A. vol. IV, pp. 255-256 and also Atri v. 389 and Ap. ( in 
verse) IX. 25 ( ed. by Jivananda ). This practice, however, 
persisted till modern times. For example, in an inscription dated 
about 1425 1171 A. D. from Padaivldu (North Arcot District) 
we find an agreement signed by the representatives of Karnata, 
Tamil, Telugu and Lata ( South Gujarat ) brahmanas that they 
would give up taking gold for their daughters and get them 
married by the simple kanyadana ( the Brahma form ) and that 
the father who accepted gold and the bridegroom who paid gold 
were to be punished by the king and were to be excommunica- 
ted from the brahmana caste. The Peshwa 117 ' issued orders 
( about 1800 A. D. ) addressed to the brahmanas of Wai ( in the 
Satara District ) forbidding them to take money for giving 
their daughters in marriage and prescribing fines for the father

who took money, for the giver and the intermediary who 
brought about the marriage. Among certain castes and among 
the sudras even now money or money's worth is often taken 
when a daughter is married, but generally the money is meant as 
a provision for the girl and for daf raying the expenses of the 
girl's father. 

The question of the sale of girls in marriage.has been from, 
the remotest ages bound up with the question of the father's* 
power over his children Rg. I. 116. 16 1180 and I. 117. 17 refer 
to the story of Rjrasva who was deprived of his eye-sight by his 
father because the former gave a hundred rams to a she-wolf. 
The verses refer to some natural phenomena under a metapho- 
rical garb and cannot be used for drawing the inference that a 
father could in law deprive his son of eye-sight at his will. 
The story of Sunahsepa ( Ait. Br. 33 ) shows that in rare cases 
the father did sell his son. The passage of the Nirukta about 
the power to sell, to gift away or to abandon daughters has been 
already cited ( p. 505 ). The Vas. Dh. S. 1 ,81 ( XVII. 30-31 ) says 
4 Sunahsepa is an example of the son bought* ( one of the twelve 
kinds of sons). The same sutra (XVII. 36-37) defines the apaviddha 
kind of son as one, who being cast off by his parents, is accepted 
(as a son) by another. Manu IX. 171 also defines the 'apaviddha* 
in the same way. Vas. Dh. S. ( XV. 1-3 ) propounds the absolute 
power of the parents over their children in the words ' man pro- 
duced from seed and uterine blood springs from the father and 
the mother; (therefore) the parents have power to give, to sell 
or to abandon him ; but one should not give nor accept an only 
son*. Here Vas. states the right of patria potestas several 
centuries before Justinian, who makes the vain boast ( Institutes* 
Lib. I. Tit. IX. 2) that *no other people have a power over 
their children such as we have over ours'. Manu (VIII. 416) 
andtheMahabharata 1182 (Udyoga 33. 64) both state that the 
wife, the son and the slave are without wealth and that what- 
ever they acquire belongs to him whose they are. Manu ( in 
V. 152) says that 'gift (by the father of the bride) is the source 
of (the husband's) ownership (over her)'. But gradually the

508 History of Marmdiastrd [ Ch. lÂ£ 

rigour of the father's power was lessened by other competing 
considerations such as the ideas that the son was the father 
himself born again, and that the son conferred great spiritual 
benefit on the souls of the father and his ancestors by the balls 
of rice offered in sraddha. So gradually the father's power over 
the son became restricted. Kautilya (III. 13) gives the inte- 
resting information that mlecclws incur no blame by selling or 
pledging their children, but an arija cannot be reduced to the 
state of slavery. Yaj. II. 175 and Narada ( dattapradanika 4 ) 
both forbid the gift of one's son or wife. Katyayana 1183 says 
that though the father has powers of control over the wife and 
the son, he has not the power to sell or make a gift of his son. 
Yaj. (II. 118-119 ) modified the rule about the son's acquisitions 
also. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes a fine of 600 panas for aban- 
doning one's mother, father, wife or son when they are not 
sinners. Vide Yaj. II. 237, Visrm Dh. S. V. 113-114, Kautilya 
III. 20 ( p. 199 ) for a similar provision. Manu ( VIII. 299-300 ) 
restricted a man's power to award corporal punishment for 
misconduct to his wife, son or slave to striking with a rope or a 
thin piece of bamboo. 

One question discussed by dharmasiitra writers is whether 
one has ownership over one's wife and children. In Jaimini im 
(VI. 7. 1-2) it is decided that in the Visvajifc sacrifice where one 
is to give away all that one has, one cannot give away one's 
parents and other relatives as one can make a gift only of what 
one is master of. The Mifc. on Yaj. II. 175 says ' though one 
cannot make a gift of one's wife or child to another, one is 
still owner of them.' The Vlramifcrodaya 1185 (vyavahara p. 567) 
is of the same opinion. On the other hand the Tantraratna 
( of ParthasÂ£rathitnisra ) says that the word gift with reference 
to the son and the like is used only in a secondary sense viz. 
that of passing to another the power of control over the son

or the daughter. The VyavahSramayukha is also of the 
same opinion. 

Afew words may be said about infanticide. Westermarck 
in his * Origin and Development of Moral Ideas * vol. L ( 1906 ) 
pp. 393-413 furnishes an exhaustive account of this practice 
in ancient and modern times among barbarous and civilised 
communities from various countries, e. g. in Sparta ( for the 
purpose of securing strong and healthy fighters ), among the 
Rajputs ( from family pride and fear of the crushing burden of 
expenses at marriage ). 1188 He is wrong in saying that in the 
Vedic times infanticide or exposure of children was practised. 
Rg. II. 29. 1 ll87 is of no use on this point; it says ' cast off from 
me sin as a woman who secretly gives birth to a child ( casts 
it off).' This is not a reference to infanticide of children 
born in wedlock, but refers to the exposure of a child by an 
unmarried woman which is clandestinely practised everywhere 
and as regards which even in England a very lenient attitude 
is shown as manifested by the passing of the Infanticide Act 
( 12 and 13 Geo. V. Chap. 18 ). The most important passage 
on which some European scholars like Zimmer and Delbriick 
rely upon for this proposition is Tai. S. VI. 5. 10. 3 ' They go to 
the ambhrlha }m (the final sacrificial bath); they keep aside 
the sthalis ( pots ) and take up the vessels for vSyu : therefore 
they ( the people ) keep aside the girl when she is born and lift 
up ( i. e. greet with pride and joy ) the son \ This simply refers 
to the fact that a daughter was not greeted as much as the son. 
It has nothing to do with exposure or infanticide. That passage 
only expresses the sentiment contained in the Ait. Br. 1189 (33. 1 )

&10 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

'the wife is indeed a friend, fche daughter is distress (or humilia- 
tion ), the son is light in the highest heaven \ The Mahabharata 
( Adi. 159. 11 ) in a similar vein says ' the son is one's 
self, the wife is one's friend, but the daughter is indeed a 
difficulty \ But all the same the Grhyasufcras like Ap. ( 15. 13 ) 
call upon the father to greet his daughter also with a mantra 
when he returned from a journey, the difference being that 
in the case of the son there is kissing of the son's head and 
muttering of certain mantras in his right ear. Manu (IX. 232) 
advises the king to award death sentence to him who kills a 
woman, a child or a brahmana. Manu IX. 130 ( =Anu&asana 
45. 11 ) expressly says that ' just as the son is one's own self, 
so is the daughter like the son ; how oan another person take the 
wealth ( of the deceased ) when his daughter who is his own 
self is there to take it ' ? Narada m0 ( d&yabhÂ§,ga v. 50) reasons 
that both the son and the daughter continue the line of the 
father and therefore in the absence of the son the daughter suc- 
ceeds as heir. Brhaspati exclaims * the daughter is born from 
the limbs of the parents as much as the son ; when she is alive 
how can another take her father's estate ' ? Bfina, who as a 
great poet had unparalleled sympathy with the emotions and 
feelings of the average man, makes even the king Prabbakara- 
vardhana say about his daughter what every Indian father has 
felt for thousands of years ' this rule of law laid down by some 
one viz. that one's own children ( daughters ) sprung from 
one's body, fondled on one's knees and whom one would 
never forsake, are taken away all of a sudden by persons 
( husbands ) who till then were quite unfamiliar. It is on 
account of this sorrow that although both (son and daughter) 
are one's own children the good feel sorrow when a daughter is 
born and who offer water in the form of tears to their daughters 
at the very time of their birth '. A daughter was not greeted 
at birth, not because tha father had no love for her, but because

he felt fchafc a daughter meant a source of anxiety all her 
life to him. It was the great concern felt for a daughter's 
well-being in life and her character that made the parents 
anxious that no daughter be born to them. Society expected a 
very high moral rectitude from women and treated lapses of 
men with leniency. This is finely expressed in the Ramayana 
( Uttara-kSnda9. 10-11). Ancient literature did not everywhere 
treat women with scorn and contempt. It has already been shown 
how highly the wife was regarded even in the most ancient 
days as a man's half. IJg. III. 53. 4 speaks of the wife as a 
haven of rest ( jayed-astam ). The Chan. Up. 1191 looks upon the 
sight of a woman in a dream as very auspicious and as 
prognosticating success in religious rites already undertaken. 
Manu ( III. 56 = Anusasana 46. 5 ), though he has said, as will 
be shown later on, some very hard things about women, was 
not unmindful of the honour due to them and saya in a 
chivalrous spirit ' where women are honoured there the gods 
love to reside ; where they are not honoured, there all religious 
acts come to nought. 1 Maidens were regarded as pure ( vide 
p. 296 above ) and auspicious. When the king passed through 
his capital it was customary to greet h im with fried grain showered 
by maidens (Raghuvariisa II. 10). TheSaunaka-karika 11,2 (ms. in 
Bombay University Library folio 22 b) includes a maiden among 
the eight objects which were auspicious. The Dronaparva(82, 
20-22 ) mentions numerous objects which Arjuna looked at and 
touched as auspicious when starting for battle, among which 
well-decked maidens are mentioned. Gobhila-srarki II. 163 says 
that one that sees on rising from bed in the morning among 
others a woman whose husband is living is free from all diffi- 
culties. The Vamana-purana (14. 35-36) mentions several 
objects which are auspicious when one is about to leave home, 
among which figure brahmana maidens. Vide Sm. 0. 1, p. 168. 

Some remarks must be made about the times auspicious for 
marriage. In the marriage hymn (Rgveda lm X. 85. 13) the

words occur 'the cows are killed on the AghSs and (the bride) 
is carried away (from her father's house) on the Phalgunls'. 
The cow was killed in Madhu parka which was offered to the 
bridegroom on the day of marriage. Or this may be a reference 
to the giving of cows by the bridegroom to the bride's father 
(as in the form later called arsa). So it appears probable that 
this is a reference to marriage being performed on the day 
when the moon was in conjunction with the constellation of 
Aghas (i. e. Magba). The two Phalgunls follow immediately 
after the Magha naksatra. There is an echo of this in the 
Ap. gr. III. 1-2 which says 'cows are accepted on the Maghas 
and (the bride) is carried (to the bridegroom's house ) on the 
Phalgunls'. This means that the marriage '(probably in the 
arsa form) is celebrated on the Maghas and the bride goes from 
her father's house on the next day after marriage or after 
one day more. The As v. gr. ( I. 4. I ) says ,m that 'in the 
northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month 
and on an auspicious lunar mansion, caula, upanayana, godSna 
and marriage are to be performed and that according to some 
teachers marriage may be celebrated at all times' (not necessarily 
in northward passage &c). The Ap. gr. (2.12-13) prescribes 
that all seasons except the two months of Sisira ( i. e. Magha and 
Phalguna)and the last of the two months of summer (viz. Asadha) 
are fit for marriage and all naksatras which are declared to be 
auspicious ( or holy ). Ap. gr. further ms adds ( 3. 3 ) ' a father 
who desires that his daughter should be dear (to her husband ) 
should give her in marriage on the Nistya (i.e. Svati con- 
stellation ) ; thus she becomes dear ( to her husband ), she does 
not return (to her parent's house); this is a procedure based 
upon the Br&hmana passage.' The Brahmana passage is Tai. 
Br. I. 5, 2. The Baud. gr. ( I. 1. 18-19 ) is the same 11M as Ap. gr. 
about months and adds that the naksatras for marriage are 
RohinI, Mrgaslrsa, Uttara PhalgunI, Svati ; while Punarvasu,

Tisya ( Pusya ), Hasfca, Sravana and RevatI are suitable for 
other ceremonies of an auspicious character. The Manava gr. 
( I. 7. 5 ) says that the naksatras RohinI, Mrgasiras, Sravana* 
Sravistfia ( Dhanistha ) and the Uttaras ( i. e. Uttarasadha, 
Uttara PhalgunI and Uttara Bhadrapada) are fit for marriage 
and for taking the bride from her parent's house and whatever 
other ( naksatra ) is declared to be auspicious. Kathaka gr. 
14. 9-10 and Varaha gr. 10 are similar. The Ramfiyana lm 
( Balakanda 72. 13 and 71. 24 ) speaks of marriage being per- 
formed on Uttara PhalgunI, of which Bhaga is the deity. The 
Mahabharata also speaks of marriage on a naksatra presided 
over by Bhaga ( Adiparva8. 16 ). The Kausika sutra ( 75. 2-4) 
makes an approach to modern practice when it prescribes that 
marriage should be celebrated after the full moon of Kartika 
and up to the full moon of Vaisakha or one may do as one likes 
but should avoid the month or half month of Caitra. }m 

Medieval digests introduce many detailed rules derived 
from astrology which it is not possible to set out here. A few 
only will be indicated. The Udvahatattva ( p. 124 ) quotes 
Rajamartanda im and Bhuja-balabhlma to the effect that all 
months are auspicious for marriage except Caitra and Pausa 
and that when a girl is very much grown-up one should not 
wait for auspicious seasons, but she should be given away on 
any day when the moon and the zodiacal sign rising at the 
moment of marriage are favourable, and that one should go 
into questions of auspicious ayana, month, day &c. up to only 
the tenth year of girls. The Sainskararatnamala ( p. 460 ) says 
that as there is conflict among the dicta of sutra and smrti

writers about months one should follow the usage of one's 
country. One should not celebrate the marriage of the eldest 
son with the eldest daugter of a man in the month of Jyestha 
(or on Jyestha naksatra ) nor should one celebrate a marriage in 
the month of birth or on the day of birth or naksatra of birth 
( of the eldest son or daughter ). Wednesday, Monday, Friday 
and Thursday are the best days of the week, but the Madana- 
parijata says that any day is good if the marriage is celebrated 
at night. 120 Â° In marriage the moon must be in a strong position 
for girls. One should avoid Jupiter being the 4fch, 8th or 12th 
from one's rasi ( zodiacal sign in which the moon was at the time 
of birth). The Nirnayasindhu quotes a verse that when the girl 
has reached puberty, then one should not wait till Jupiter is 
favourable, but marriage should be performed even when Jupiter 
is 8th from the zodiacal sign of birth, propitiatory rites however 
being performed for Jupiter. 1201 Upanayana and marriage 
cannot be performed when Jupiter is in the zodiacal sign called 
Leo (Simha), but this applies only to the tract between the river 
Godavari and the Ganges. m * From the naksatra and zodiacal 
sign at the time of birth ( in the case of both the girl and the 
bridegroom) certain astrological calculations were made in 
eight ways 1203 called kutas. They were Varna, Vasya, 
Naksatra, Yoni, Graha ( planets governing the twelve rasis ), 
Gana, Rasi, and NadI, each later one of which was 
more powerful than each preceding one and marks (guna) 
from 1 to 8 were respectively assigned to each of these if the 
conditions laid down were satisfied. Two of these viz. gana 
and nadl are attached great importance even now among brah- 
manas and other classes also and so they may be illustrated 
here, though very briefly. The Vt naksatras are arranged in 
three groups of nine each, each group being assigned to Deva- 
gana, Manusyagana and Raksasagana as follows :

If the bride and bridegroom are born on naksatras that 
belong to the same class out of these three groups it is the best 
thing but if their naksatras of birth belong to different groups, 
then the rules are : it is middling if their naksatras belong to 
the deva group or the human group respectively, or if the bride- 
groom's naksatra being of the devagana or raksasagana, the 
bride's is of the manusyagana, while if the naksatra of the bride 
is of the raksasa group and the bridegroom's of the manusya 
type, then death would result. Similarly if the naksatras of 
the pair respectively belong to the deva and raksasa groups, 
there would be quarrels and enmity between the two. 

For the purpose of nadl the naksatras are divided into 
three groups of nine each, adyanadl, madhyanadl and antyanadl, 
as follows : 



Adyanadl 


Madhyanadl 


Antyanadl 


AsvinI

If the naksatras of the intended pair belong to the same 
nadl, then that portends death and so there is to be no marriage 
in such a case. The respective naksatras of birth in the case 
of the two should belong to different nadls. 



516 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. 13 

The anxieties of the girls' father did not end here. If afte 
the marriage was settled but before it actually took place anj 
relative in any of the two families died, then the marriage 
agreement was to be broken off according to some writers, bu 
Saunaka 1204 mercifully states a more sensible and reasonable 
rule viz. if the father or mother or paternal grand-father oi 
paternal grand-mother or paternal uncle, brother or unmarriec 
sister of the intended bride or bridegroom dies, or the bride 
groom's first wife or his son from another wife dies, then only 
it is pratikula and the marriage should not be performed 
but the death of any one else presents no obstacle. 

If before the rites of marriage begin ( i. e. before the per 
formance of nandlsraddha ), the mother of the bride or of th< 
bride-groom has her monthly illness then the marriage hai 
to be postponed till she becomes pure (till the fifth day afte 
the illness ). 

Forms of marriage : From the times of the grhya sutrae 
dharmasutras and smrtis the forms of marriage are said to b( 
eight, viz. Brahma, Prajapatya, Arsa, Daiva, Gandharva, Asura 
Raksasa and Paisaca ( vide Asv. gr. I. 6, Gaut. IV. 6-13, Baud 
Dh. S. I. 11, Manu III. 21 = Adi-parva 73. 8-9 ), Visnu Dh. S 
24.18-19, Yaj. L 58, Narada ( strlpumsa, verses 38-39 ), Kautily* 
III. 1, 59th prakarana, Adi-parva 102. 12-15 (they are describee 
but not named ); some of these arrange the first four differently 
e. g. Asv. gr. arranges them as Brahma, Daiva, Prajapatya an( 
Arsa, while Visnu arranges them as Brahma, Daiva, Arsa anc 
Prajapatya; Asv. gr. I. 6 places Paisaca before Raksasa. Th< 
Manava gr. speaks of only two Brahma and Saulka (i. e. Asura) 
probably because these two were the forms most current. Ap 
Dh. S. ( II. 5. 11. 17-20â11. 5. 12. 1-2 ) speaks of only six 
omitting Prajapatya and Paisaca ; while Vas. Dh. S. I. 28-2$ 
expressly says that there are only six forms of marriage viz, 
Brahma, Daiva, Arsa, Gandharva, Ksatra and Manusa ( the 
last two being the same as Raksasa and Asura). It if 
impossible for want of space to set out the various definition* 
of the several forms given by the several authors. There U 
general agreement otvthe special characteristics of each and il 
is sufficient to point out these as given in Manu III. 27-34,

Ch. IX ] Forms of Marriage 517 

The gift of a daughter, after decking her (with valuable 
garments ) and honouring her ( with jewels &c. ), to a man 
learned in the Vedas and of good conduct, whom the father of 
the girl himself invites, is called Brahma. When the father 
gives away his daughter after decking her (with ornaments &c.) 
to a priest, who duly officiates at a sacrifioe, during the course 
of ifcs performance, it is the Daiva form. 1205 When there is 
a gift of one's daughter, after taking one pair of cattle ( a cow 
and a bull ) or two pairs only as a matter of fulfilling the law 
( and not as a sale of the girl ), that is named the arsa form. 
The gift of a daughter, after the father has addressed ( the 
couple with the words ' may both of you perform your religious 
duties together ' ) and after he has honoured the bride-groom 
( with Madhuparka &c. ), is deolared to constitute the Prajapatya 
form. Yaj. I. 60 calls this ' kaya \ because in the Brahmana 
works 'ka* means * Prajapati \ When the girl is given away at 
the father's will after the bride-groom gives as much wealth as 
he can afford to pay to the relatives of the girl and to the girl 
herself, that is called the Asura form. The union of a girl and 
the bride-groom by their mutual consent is known as Gandharva, 
which springs from the passion of love and has intercourse as 
its purpose. The forcible abduction of a maiden from her 
house, while she weeps and cries aloud, after her kinsmen have 
been slain ( or beaten ), wounded and (their houses or fortresses) 
are broken open, is called the RSksasa form. When a man has 
intercourse with a girl stealthily while she is asleep or intoxi- 
cated or disordered in mind (or unconscious), that is the Paisaca 
form, which is the basest and the most sinful of all forms. 

In the first four forms there is the gift of the girl (kanyadana) 
by the father or other guardian to the bride-groom. The word 
*dana* here is used in a secondary sense (as stated above on p. 504) 
viz. in the sense of transfer of the father's right of guardianship 
and control of the maiden to the husband. All gifts are to be 
made with water in the case of brahmanas as stated by Manu

According to him tho girl bocomo9 part of the dahsinU (fee) for 
officiating. But in the Vedas and Srauta sutras a bride is nowhero 
spoken of as dakginS. Medhstithi on Manu III. 28 is against the idea 
of tho biide being part of the sacrificial fee. VisVarGpa also says so; 
but AparUrka p. 89 holds that the girl is given as fee. 



518 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

( III. 35 ) and Gaut. V. 16-17. ,208 Similarly in all the four forms 
where there is kanyadana the girl is to be well dressed and 
decked with ornaments. The essence of the brahma form is 
that the girl is given without receiving anything from the 
bride-groom, who is invited and honoured by the girl's father. 
It is called brahma either because brahma means the holy 
Veda and this mode being sanctioned by the most ancient texts 
it is the holiest and best form, or brahma means dharma and 
being the best of all forms it is called brahma ( vide Smrtimuk- 
t&phala part I. p. 140 ). In the arsa form a pair of cattle is 
received from the bride-groom and it is somewhat inferior to the 
brahma form. But the pair is given not as a price ( i. e. there 
is no purchase ), but because that is one way of effecting a 
marriage laid down by the sastras ( vide the passage quoted 
above at p. 504 ' therefore one should give a hundred cows &c ' 
and Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 11, which is opposed to Vas. Dh. S. I. 36 ) 
and the gift is made to show one's regard for the girl (vide Manu 
III. 53-54 ). The daiva form is only appropriate to brahmanas 
as only ,307 a brahmana could offioiate at a sacrifice. It is so 
called because the bridegroom is engaged at the time in rites 
for the gods and it is inferior to the brahma inasmuch as in it 
there is some trace of benefit to the father ( that the priest may 
do his best in the rite for the gods ). Govindasvamin on Baud. 
Dh. S. says * the bride is in this form part of the sacrificial fee '. 
In all forms of marriage the husband and wife have to perform 
all religious acts together, as forcibly put by Ap. Dh. S. 1208 
( there is no separation between husband and wife, since from 
the time of taking the hand of the wife there is joint perform- 
ance of all religious actions). But in the Prajapatya the 
words used indicate according to the commentators ( vide Sam.

Pr. p. 852 and Haradatta on Qaufc. IV. 5 ) one or more of several 
things, viz. that the husband will remain a house-holder all his 
life and will not become a recluse while the wife is living or 
that he will not marry another wife i. e. it will be a strictly 
monogamous marriage which is defined in Hyde v. Hyde (1866), 
P. and M. p. 130 as * the voluntary union for life of one man 
and one woman to the exclusion of all others ' ( p. 133 ), or that 
he will associate the wife with himself not only in sacrifices 
but also in works of charity ( like building tanks, wells &c. ). 
This form is inferior to brahma in that the father, as it were, 
makes a special stipulation with the bride-groom, while in the 
brahma there is no such special stipulation, but the bride-groom 
promises that he will not break faith with his wife in the 
matter of the three purusarthas, dharma, artha, kama. 1209 

In the asura form there is practically a sale of the girl for 
money or money's worth and so it is not approved. The Srsa is 
distinguished from asura in this that in the latter there is no 
limit to what is taken from the bride-groom, while in the former 
a pair of cattle is offered as a matter of form. In the gandharva 
there is no gift by the father ; on the contrary the father's 
authority is set at naught by the girl for the time being. Marriage 
was a sacrament according to ancient sages, and its principal 
purposes as stated above (pp, 428-29) were the acquisition of merit 
by the performance of religious duty and of progeny. In the 
gandharva form the principal object was gratification of carnal 
desires and so it is held inferior to the first four forms and is 
disapproved. This kind of marriage is so called because it is 
prompted by mutual love and the Gandharvas were known to 
be libidinous, as the Tai. S. VI. 1. 6. 5 (strlkama vai Gandharvah) 
and Ait. Br. V. 1 state. In this form at least the girl's feelings 
are consulted. In the raksasa and the paisaca, there is no gift 
by the father and both are or may be against the wish of the girl. 
The forcible carrying of the girl is the essence of the raksasa 
( even if there is no fight because the girl's father takes no 
retaliatory steps in fear of the abductor's strength). It is 
called raksasa because raksasas ( demons ) are known from 
legends to have been addicted to cruel and forceful methods. 
The paisaca is so called because in it there is action like that of 
pisacas ( goblins ) that are supposed to act stealthily by night.

It is not to be supposed that when ancient sages held that 
raksasa and paisaca were forms of marriage, they legalized 
marriage by capture or stealth. What they meant was that 
these were the means of securing 121 Â° wives and that there are 
not really eight kinds of vivahas, but rather there are eight 
ways in which wives may be secured. It is for this reason 
that Vatsa says that if a fine girl cannot be secured by any 
means she may be approached even in private by stealth and 
married. The sages condemned in no measured terms the 
paisaca. From the fact that ApaBtamba and Vasis^ha both 
ignore the Paisaca and Prajapatya it may be inferred that these 
two had ceased to be recognised by their time and that the other 
sages enumerated them only because they appeared in ancient 
works and for the sake of completeness of treatment. Vasistha 
( 17. 73 ) expressly repudiates the idea th&t legal wifehood can 
arise by forcible seizure of a girl ' if a damsel 12U has been 
abducted by force and not wedded with sacred texts she may 
lawfully be given to another man ( in marriage ) ; she is just 
as good as a maiden \ The smrfcis out of regard for the future 
welfare of the girl preferred to blink at the > wrong done, but 
insisted upon the abductor or stealthy seducer performing the 
rites of horna and saptapadi in order to confer on the girl 
wronged the status of a legally married wife. But if the 
wrong-doer was unwilling to do this they recommended that the 
girl may be given to another in marriage and pronounced very 
heavy punishments for the abductor or seducer of a girl ( vide 
Manu VIII. 366 and Yaj. II. 287-288). Sir Gooroodas 
Banerjee ,218 rightly expresses surprise at Macnaughten's saying 
that fraud was legalised by the Hindu Law in the case of the 
paisaca form. Manu VIII. 366 says that if a man has inter- 
course with a girl of his own caste with her consent, he will 
have to give a fee to the father if the latter so desires and

Ch. IX ] Forms of Marriage 521 

Medhatzthi 12,s adds that if the father does not desire money 
the lover will have to pay a fine to the king, that the girl may 
be given to him or if she has lost her love for him, she may be 
given to another and if the lover himself wants to discard her 
he should be forced to accept her ( as a wife ). NSrada ( strl- 
purhsa, verse 72 ) similarly says that if a man has sexual inter- 
course with a maiden who is a consenting party, then there is 
no offence, but he must marry her after decking her ( with 
ornaments) and treating her with honour. 

The Sra. C. and other digests state that in the gandharva, 
asura, raksasa and paisaca horn a and saptapadl are necessary 
and they quote Devala and the Grhyaparisista in support. The 
Mahabharata ( Adi. 195. 7) l2u expressly says that even after 
svayamvara religious rites had to be performed. Kalidasa in 
Raghuvarhsa VII describes how after the svayamvara of Indu- 
matl the principal religious rites of madhuparka, homa, going 
round the fire, panigrahana took place. Since Asvalayana first 
speaks of eight forms and then prescribes the performance of 
homa and saptapadl, he implies that these are necessary in 
all forms. 

The smrtis contain several views about the suitability of 
these eight to various varnas. All are agreed that the first four, 
brahma, daiva, arsa and prajapatya, are the approved forms 
( prasasta or dharmya ). Vide Gaut. IV. 12, Ap. Dh. S 

II. 5. 12. 3, Manu III. 24, Narada (stripurhsa, verse 44) &c. Most 
say that each preceding one out of the first four is superior to 
each succeeding one and that thus brahma is the best (vide Ap. 
Db. S. II. 5. 12. 4, Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 11). Almost all are 
agreed that paisaca is the worst. Manu III. 23-26 refers to 
several views. One view is that the first four ( brahma &c. ) are 
the proper forms for brahmanas ( Baud. Dh. S. I. 11.10, Manu 

III. 24 ). Another view was that the first six ( out of the eight 
i. e. all except raksasa and paisaca ) are allowed to brahmanas 
and the last four to ksatriyas, and the gandharva, Ssura and 
paisaca to vaisyas and ^udras ( Manu III. 23 ). A third view 
was that prajapatya, g&ndharva and asura may be resorted to

by all varnas and paisaca and asura should not be resorted to 
by any one of any varna ( Manu III. 25 = Anusasana 44. 9-10 ), 
but in another verse ( III. 24 ) Manu allows asura to vaisyas 
and sudras 12Ua . Manu mentions the view that the gandharva 
and raksasa are proper ( dharmya ) for a ksatriya or a mixture of 
these two viz. where the girl loves the bride-groom, but her 
parents or guardians disapprove or cause obstacles and the 
lover takes away the girl after a fight with her relations (Manu 
III. 26 and Baud. Dh. S. 1. 11. 13). Baud. Dh.S. 1215 (1. 11. 14-16) 
recommends asura and paisaca to vaisyas and sudras and 
assigns the interesting reason ' for the vaisyas and sudras do 
not keep their wives under restraints, they having to do the 
work of ploughing and waiting upon (the other varnas)'. 
Narada ( sfcrlpurhsa, verse 40 ) says that gandharva is common to 
all varnas. The Kamasutra ( III. 5. 28 ) first speaks of the 
brahma as the best ( following the view of the dharmasastra 
writers ) and then, true to its own particular subject, gives its 
own opinion that gandharva is the best ( Kamasutra 
III. 5. 29-30 ). 

The gandharva form was very much in vogue among royal 
families. In the Sakuntala, 1B16 Kalidasa gives expression to 
this practice. In the Mahabharata 1217 Krsna says to Arjuna 
who was in love with Subhadra that carrying away by force 
one's lady-love is commended in the case of valiant ksatriyas. 
In the Sanjan plates of Amoghavarsa ( dated iake 793 ) it is 
stated that Indraraja married the daughter of the Calukya king 
at Kaira by the raksasa form of marriage ( E. I. vol. 18, p. 235 
at p. 243 ). Another and a very famous historic example of the 
raksasa form is the forcible abduction after a most dashing 
and valiant fight by Prthvlraja Cohan of the daughter of

Jayacandra, the king of Kanoj. l218 It is said that the daughter 
of Jayacandra was a consenting party; in that case this would 
be a mixture of the two forms of gandharva and raksasa 
( compare Manu III. 26 ). 

The svayamvara very often spoken of in the dharmasastras 
was praotically the gandharva as stated by the commentary 
Viramitrodaya. 121d It had several varieties. The simplest 
form of svayamvara occurs when, as described by Vas, Dh. S. 17. 
67-68, Manu IX. 90, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 13, a girl, who 
attains puberty and whose father does not find a proper 
husband for three years, herself seeks her husband ( or after 
three months from puberty according to Gaut. 18. 20, Visnu 
Dh. S. 25. 40-41 ). Yaj. I. 64 also recommends svayamvara to 
every girl when there is no parent or other guardian who can 
find out a worthy husband for her. When a girl chose her own 
husband as above she had to return all ornaments given to her 
by her parents or brother and the husband who married her had 
to pay no iulka ( dowry ) to the father as the latter lost his power 
over her by not giving her away in time ( vide Gaut. 18. 20 and 
Manu IX. 92 ). This simple svayamvara was applicable to 
girls of all castes. Savitrl indulged in this kind of svayam- 
vara, when she went about in a chariot to find out a suitable 
husband for herself. But the svayamvaras described in the 
two great epics are often most elaborate and spectacular affairs 
and were confined to royal families. The Adiparva says 
that ksatriyas commend svayamvara and resort to it, but they 
prefer a girl who is carried off after subduing her relatives. 
Bhlstna carried off the three daughters of the king of KasI and 
got two of them ( Ambika and Ambalika ) married to his ward 
Vicitravlrya. 122 Â° The svayamvara of Sifca or DraupadI did not 
depend upon the will of the bride, but the bride was to be 
given in marriage to whomsoever showed a certain skill as a 
warrior. In the case of DamayantI it was a real choice of her 
husband by her ( Vanaparva 54 ff. ) though she chose Nala in a 
vast and splendid assembly of royal suitors. Kalidasa also

524 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

gives us a fine description of the svayamvara of IndumatI in 
the Raghuvamsa. Bilhana in his Vikramanka-devacarita 
( canto IX ) gives a description of the historic svayamvara of 
Candralekha ( or CandaladevI ) daughter of the Silahara prince 
of Karahata ( modern Karad ), when she chose Ahavatnalla or 
Vikramanka, the Calukya king of Kalyana ( latter half of 11th 
century ). Such a svayamvara, it appears, was thought to be 
unsuitable to brahmanas according to the Adiparva. 1221 In the 
Kadambari ( Purvabhaga, penultimate para ) Pattralekha says 
that svayamvara is ordained in the Dharmasastras. 1222 

The Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 12. 4 makes a general statement that 
the progeny of a couple partakes of the character of the form 
in which they were married 1223 ( i. e. if the marriage is in tho 
best or in an approved form the son is good ; if the marriage 
is in a condemned form, the son bears a low character ). Manu 
( III. 39-42 ) expands the same idea by stating that sons born of 
marriages in the brahma and other three forms are full of 
spiritual eminence and are endowed with beauty, virtues, 
wealth, fame and very long life, while sons of marriages of the 
other four forms are cruel, are liars, haters of the Veda and of 
dharma. Some sutras and smrtis state how many generations 
are rendered holy by a son born in one of the first four forms. 
For example, Asv. gr. ( I. 6 ) says that a son born of parents 
married in the brahma, daiva, prajapatya or arsa forms respec- 
tively brings purification to twelve descendants and twelve 
ancestors on both sides ( i. e. his father's and mother's ), to ten 
descendants and ten ancestors on both sides, to eight descen- 
dants and ascendants on both sides and to seven descendants 
and ascendants. Manu ( III. 37-38 ) and Yaj. (*L 58-60 ) put 
the matter somewhat differently. According to them the son of 
a brahma marriage brings purification to ten paternal ancestors, 
to ten male descendants and to himself ( in all 21 ), of the daiva 
marriage to seven paternal ancestors and seven male descen- 
dants, of the prajapatya marriage to six male ancestors, to six 
male descendants and to himself (in all 13), of the arsa marriage 
to three male ancestors and three male descendants. Gaut.

( IV. 24-27 ) has similar provisions. Commentators like 
Visvarupa and Medhatithi explain that these verses are not to 
be taken literally. They merely praise the extreme desirability 
of the brahma form. Visvarupa, however, alternatively proposes 
that one may accept the texts of the holy sages as literally true, 
following the dictum of Sahara that there is nothing too heavy 
( or impossible ) for a holy text. uu One may laugh at these 
texts about the virtues of the several forms of marriage, but 
they are really intended to emphasize the high importance to 
the future of the race and to society of noble ideals of marriage, 
of morals and of a decent and peaceful mode of life. 

The forms of marriage have their roots deep down in the 
Vedic Literature. Rg. X. 85 gives expression to a marriage in 
the brahma form ( there is kanyaddna and so forth ). The asura 
form ( by payment of money ) is referred to in Rg. I. 109. 2 and 
Nirukta VI. 9 (quoted above in note 1175). The gandharva form 
or svayamvara is indicated by Rg. X. 27. 12 (quoted above p.439) 
and Rg. I. 119. 5. The story of Syavasva narrated in the Brhad- 
dovata ( V. 50 ) in connection with Rg. V. 61 makes an approach 
to the daiva form. It is related in the Brhad-devata that Atreya 
Arcananas who officiated as a priest at a sacrifice for king 
Rathaviti asked for his son Syavasva the hand of the king's 
daughter. 

In modern times two forms are in vogue, the brahma and 
asura. In the brahma form it is a gift of the girl pure and 
simple ; in the asura form it is like the sale of the bride for 
pecuniary consideration paid to tlie father or other guardian for 
his benefit. If this element of pecuniary consideration paid to 
the guardian -exists, its effects cannot be undone by the form of 
a gift being gone through. 1225 The gandharva form is said to 
be obsolete now, yet in some cases before the courts it has been 
held that it is still in vogue. 1228 There can be no gandharva if 
the girl is a minor. Further if a widow remarries, that marriage

will be ordinarily regarded as gandharva, because there will be 
no gift; of a kanya ( as she is a widow ) and because she herself 
will generally arrange such a marriage. 

Before proceeding to set oufc in detail the ceremonies of 
marriage, it would be best to analyse the contents of Rgveda 
X. 85, which is a marriage hymn redolent of the highest 
ideal of marriage and conjugal felicity and several verses 
of which are recited even now in the marriage rites. The 
hymn refers to a mythical marriage of Surya, daughter 
of Savitr, with Soma and the important features of the 
marriage, though not arranged in a regular sequence in the 
hymn, are : the two Asivins went to ask for Surya as a bride for 
Soma 1227 ( verses 8-9 ) ; Savitr agreed to give her ( v. 9 ), the 
bride-groom was treated with honour, presents were made to 
him and cows were killed for ( or presented to ) him ; Soma 
took hold of her hand with the verse (36) ' I m% take thy hand 
for prosperity ( or love ) so that you may grow to old age with 
me thy husband ; the gods, Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitr, the wise 
Pusan have given thee to me for performing the duties of a 
house-holder '; the bride is a gift by her father in the presence of 
gods and the fire ( v. 40-41 ) ; the girl passes from the dominion 
and control of her father and becomes united with her husband 
(v. 24); the bride is blest as follows: * may you stay here 
together, may you not be separated, may you compass all life 
( long life ), happy in your own house and playing with your 
sons and grandsons ; O Indra 1 make her endowed with worthy 
sons and prosperity ; bestow on her ten sons and make her 
husband the eleventh (male); may you be queen over your 
father-in-law, mother-in-law, over the husband's brother and 
sister (vv. 42, 45-46 )\ lm Among subordinate items it is 
noteworthy that Raibhya was sent along with Surya as her 
friend ( anudeyi ) to make her time not hang heavy on her hands

( v. 6 ) when she first went to her husband's family ( just as in 
modern times in Western India some woman accompanies the 
bride for a few days as patharakhiv, 'one who guards'), that even 
a female servant accompanied Surya. 123 Â° 

In connection with the rites of marriage it is necessary to 
observe that the greatest divergence prevailed from very 
ancient times. Asv. gr. ( 1. 7. 1-2 ) says * various indeed are the 
observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should 
follow those in marriages ; what, however, is common ( to all 
or most) that we shall declare*. Similarly Ap. gr. (2.15) 
declares* people should understand from women ( and others ) 
what procedure is ( to be observed according to custom ) * and the 
commentator Sudarsanacarya notes that certain rites like the 
worship of planets, ankuraropana and the tying of pratisara 
(the marriage string or ribbon round the wrist ) are usual and 
are performed with Vedic mantras, while others like Nagabali, 
Yaksabali and the worship of IndranI are performed without Vedic 
mantras. The Kathakagrhya 25. 7 allows usages of countries 
and families to be observed in marriage and the commentators 
mention several such usages. As the grhya-sutra of Asvalayana 
contains perhaps the shortest account of marriage rites and as 
that sutra is probably the most ancient among the grhya sutras 
I shall set out below the entire ceremony of marriage from that 
sutra Then a few important details from other grhya sutras 
will be added and it will be pointed out how in modern times 
a marriage is celebrated, particularly among higher classes. It 
must be remembered that there is not only great divergence as 
to the number of separate ceremonies that constitute the 
sarhskara of marriage, but the sequence of even the most 
important ceremonies is different in the several sutras and the 
mantras also are different ( though some like Rg. X. 185. 36 
are common to all ). It is remarkable that out of the 47 verses 
of Rg. X. 85, the Ap. Mantrapatha employs as many as 29 
( most of which are quoted in connection with marriage ). The 
main outlines of the marriage sarhskara show a remarkable 
continuity for several thousand years from the times of the 
Rgveda down to modern times. 

The Asv. gr. ( I. 7. 3-1. 8. ) deals with all the marriage rites 
as follows t : Having placed to the west of the fire ( that is

the north-east ( of the fire ) a water jar, he should offer sacrifice

seize only her thumb with the mantra * I take hold of thy hand 
for happiness' (Rg. X. 85. 36 quoted in note 1228), if he desires that 
only male children be born to him ; he may seize her other fingers 
if he is desirous of female children ; he may seize her hand on 
the hair side together with the thumb if he be desirous of both 
( male and female children ). Leading her thrice round the fire 
and the water jir so that their right sides are turned towards 
( the fire &c. ) he murmurs 122! ' I am ama ( this ), thou art sa 
( she ), thou art sa, I am ama ; I am heaven, thou art the earth ; I 
am the saman, thou art the rk. Let us both marry here. Let us 
beget offspring. Dear to each other, bright, having well disposed 
minds, may we live for a hundred years 1 ' Each time he leads 
her round ( the fire ) he makes her tread on the stone with ( the 
words ) ' tread on this stone; be firm like a stone ; overcome the 
enemies ; trample down the foes \ 18S * Having first poured 
clarified butter over her joined hands, the bride's brother or some 
one who is in the place of brother pours fried grain twice over 
the bride's joined hands, three times in the case of those whose 
gotra is Jamadagni ( i. e. if the bridegroom is of that gotra ). 
Then he pours clarified butter over what has been left of the 
havis (sacrificial material or offering) and over what has been cut 
off ( separated from the aggregate ). This is the rule about the 
portions to be cut off ( in every case where there is avadana)} m 
With the following verses ( recited by the bride-groom )

1233. The two portions of laja ( fried grain ) poured into the 
bride's hands together with the first pouring of ffjya ( called T^fTTT ) 
and the subsequent pouring of Sjya ( called sicTrntenT'T ) constitute tho 
four avattas or portions cut off from tho material for havis. The descen- 
dants of Jamadagni are <rar5rr%*T! (vide above p. 490); therefore 
three portions of laja are to be poured out (in order to make with 
ymtf<Â«r andJTcTrfvrorcGT, five avattas). For these terms ( Â«g^r^f^ and 
<W3Tr ) vide shuto 1, 7. 2. 7-8.

the god Aryaman loosen her from this ( i. e. her father's ) and 
not from that place ( the bride-groom's ), svaha ! to god Varuna 
the girls have offered sacrifice ; may he, god Varuna &c. To 
god Pusan the girls have offered sacrifice, to Agni ; may he, 
god Pusan &c. ; with these ( the bride ) should sacrifice ( the 
fried grain ) without opening her joined hands, as if they were 
the spoon called sruc. Without going round the fire the 
bride sacrifices fried grain a fourth time silently with the 
neb of the sUrpa ( winnowing basket ) towards herself. Some 1 * 34 
lead the bride round each time after fried grain has been 
poured out, so that the two last oblations do not follow imme- 
diately after each other. Then he loosens her two locks of hair 
if they are made up ( that is if her hair has been bound round 
on two sides with two tufts of wool ), ( the right one ) with the 
mantra 'I release thee from the fetter of Varuna' (Rg. X. 85. 24) 
and the left one with the following mantra ( Rg. X. 85. 25 ). 
Then he causes her to step forward in a north-eastern direction 
seven steps with the words ' may you take one step for sap, 
second step for juice ( or vigour ), third step for the thriving 
of wealth, fourth step for comfort, fifth step for offspring, 
sixth step for seasons, may you be my friend with your seventh 
step ! May you be devoted to me ; let us have many sons, may 
they reach old age \ ,23S Bringing the heads of the two 
( bride and bride-groom ) together, he ( the acarya ) sprinkles 

1234. The Gist view rcquiros that loading the bride round the firo, 
making her tread on the stone and the offering of fried grain are each 
repeated thrice ; so that when the offering prescribed hero for the 4th 
time is made, it follows immediately on the third offering of lajas. 
Other teachers made the bride fii at offer lajas, then she was led round 
the fire. When this was done the 4th oblation of Wjas would not como 
immediately after the third oblation of lajas, but after she went round 
the lire the third time. The Gobhila gr. II. 1. 14 prescribes that the fiied 
grain to be offered into firo is mixed with tendrils of the skini plant and 
KslidSsa ( in Raghuvams'a VII. 25-26 ) refers to iami and lajas. 

1235. This (the *npTiÂ£Haking seven steps together) is the moBt 
important rite in the marriage samska*ra. We have to understand '^isr' 
after each sentence' fq- qwi^X *TC 3i$f I^T^fr **â¢' These words occur in 
all grhyaautras, e. g. vide Ap. M. P. I. 3. 7-14 and &p. gr. 4. 15-16, &3n.

there are slight variations as well. For example, <m^nT, *TT5r*r, f%*<nro

their heads with water from the water jar. And the bride 
should dwell that night in the house of an old brahmana 
woman whose husband and children are alive. 12 * 6 When she 
(the bride ) has seen the Pole star, the star Arundhati and the 
seven sages ( the constellation of Ursa Major ), let her break 
her silence and say * may my husband live and may I secure 
offspring V m If ( the newly married couple ) have to make a 
journey ( to their home in another village ), let him cause the 
bride to mount a chariot with the verse ' may Pusan lead thee 
from here holding thy hand * ( Rg. X 85. 26 ) ; he should make 
her ascend into a boat with the hemistitch * carrying stones 
( or the river called Asmanvatl) flows; get ready ' (Rg. X. 53. 8) 
and let him make her descend from the boat with the following 
hemistitch; if she weeps let him pronounce the verse 'they 
weep for the living ' ( Rg. X. 40. 10 ). They constantly carry 
the nuptial fire in front. At pleasing places, trees and cross 
roads, let him mutter * may no way-layers meet us* ( Rg. X. 85. 
32). At every dwelling place (on the way) let him look at 
the onlookers with the mantra ' this newly married bride 
brings good luck ' ( Rg. X. 85. 33 ). He should make her enter 
his house with the verse ' here may happiness increase unto you 
through offspring ' ( Rg. X. 85. 27 ). Having kindled with fuel 
sticks the nuptial fire and having spread to the west of it a 
bull's hide with the neck turned towards the east and the hair 
outside he makes oblations, while she ( the bride ) is sitting 
( on that hide ) and takes hold of him, with the four verses 
( one oblation with each verse ) ' may Prajapati create offspring 
to us ' ( Rg. X. 85. 43-46 ) ; and then he partakes of curds with 
the verse ' may all the gods unite our hearts * ( Rg. X. 85. 47 ) 
and gives ( the remaining curds ) to her or he besmears the 
heart ( of both ) with the rest of the ajya ( with part of which he 
had already sacrificed ). From that time they should not eat 
ksara m * and lavana % should observe celibacy, wear ornaments 
and sleep on the ground (not on cots) for three nights or twelve 
nights or for a year according to some ( teachers ) ; thus ( those 

1236. This rule has no application if the bride and the bride-groom 
belong to the samo village. But if they belong to difforont villages and 
the newly married couple bavo to stay somewhere for the night on 
their journey then this rulo applies. 

1237. This indicates that after the homa is finished, the bride is to 
observe silence till she sees the Pole star.

teachers say ) a rsi will be born as a son ( to them ). When he 
has fulfilled these observances he should give the bride's shift to 
a brahmana who knows the Surya hymn (Rg. X, 85) and food to 
brahmanas. Then he should cause the brahmanas to pronounce 
auspicious words. 

In this description of the samskara of marriage there are 
three parts. There are certain rites that are preliminary, there 
are then a few rites that are of the essence of the samskara viz. 
panigrahana, homa, going round the fire and the saptapadl, and 
there are certain rites like the seeing of the Pole star &c. that 
are subsequent to the central rites. The essential rites are 
mentioned by all sutrakaras, but as to the preceding and sub- 
sequent rites there is a great divergence in the details. Even 
as regards the essential rites the sequence in which they take 
place differs. For example, the Asv. gr. (I. 7. 7) describes 
going round the fire before saptapadl, while the Ap. gr. describes 
saptapadl (IV. 16) before the act of going round the fire ( V. 1 ). 
The Gobhila grhya (II. 2. 16), the Khadira gr. (1.3.31), and Baud, 
gr. ( I. 4. 10 ) describe panigrahana after saptapadl while many 
other sutrakaras describe it before saptapadl. Then again there 
are many acts reference to which is altogether omitted in the 
Asv. gr., e. g. there is no reference to madhuparka (which is 
mentioned in Ap. gr. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. 2. 1, Manava gr. I. 9) 
nor to kanyadana ( which is referred to in Par. gr. I. 4 and 
described in detail in Manava gr. I. 8. 6-9). Asv. probably 
omitted express mention of kanyadana, because in defining the 
first four forms he uses the word 'dadyaV while in the last four 
there is no kanyadana and Asv. wanted to describe ceremonies 
that were common to all forms. 

Taking as many grhya sutras as I could read, the following 
is a fairly exhaustive list of the different matters described in 
the samskara of marriage. A few notes are added against 
those that are deemed important. 1239 

Vadhumra-gunapariksa: (examining the suitability of a 
girl or a bride-groom ). This has been dealt with already ( vide 
pp. 429-436 above). 

Varapresana' (sending persons to negotiate for the hand 
of the girl ). The ancient custom seems to have been to send 

1239. Among the principal ceremonies in marriage described by 
KslidSsa in the Raghuvamrfa VII are madhuparka, homa, going round the 
tire, pffnigrahana, lsja-homa and ffrdrSkfata-ropana. 



532 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. 13 

some person or persons ( Rg. X. 85. 8-9 ) to the father of the gir 
for asking her in marriage. The same was the practice in th< 
sutras. Vide San, gr. I. 6. 1-4 (where Rg. X. 85. 23 is th< 
mantra recited when sending them), Baud. gr. I. 1. 14-15, Ap 
gr. II. 16 and IV. 1-2 and 7. Even in medieval times, parti 
cularly among ksatriyas, the bride-groom was the first to seefc 
for the hand of a girl. In the Harsacarita, prince Grahavarms 
of the Maukhari race sent messengers for the hand of princess 
Rajya&rl, sister of Harsa 1240 . In modern times among th< 
brahmanas and many other castes, the girl's father has to seek 2 
bride-groom, though among the siidras and several other castes 
the old practice is retained. 

Vagdana or Van-niscaya: (settling the marriage). Thif 
is described by San. gr. I. 6. 5-6. Medieval works like th< 
S. R. M. pp. 529-533 describe this ceremony at great length. 

Mandapa-karana ; Erecting a pandal where the ceremonies 
are to be performed. Par. gr. I. 4 says that marriage, caula 
upanayana, kesanta and slmanta are to be performed outsid* 
the house in a pandal. Vide Sam Pr. pp. 817-818. 

Nandi-sraddha and Punyahavacana : These are referred tc 
by Baud, gr, I. 1. 24 ; most of the grhyasutras are silent aboul 
these. Vide for these pp. 216, 218 above. 

Vadhugrhapamana: (bride-groom's going to the bride's 
house). Vide San. gr. I. 12. 1. 

Madhuparka: (reception of the bride-groom at the bride'g 
house ). Ap. gr. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. 2. 1, Manava gr. I. 9 anc 
Kathaka gr. 24. 1-3 prescribe this. Vide below chap. X foi 
madhuparka. San. gr. 1. 12. 10 appears to refer to two madhu 
paikas, one before marriage and one after marriage (when the 
bride-groom returned to his own house). The commentatoi 
Adityadar^ana on Kathaka gr. 24. 1 refers to the opinion oi 
some that madhuparka should be offered at the close of th< 
marriage, but states his own view that in all countries it is 
offered before marriage. 

Snapana, Paridhapana and Samnaliana : ( making the bride 
bathe, put on new clothes and girding her with a string or rop< 
of darbha. ) Vide Ap. gr, IV. 8 and Kathaka gr. 25. 4. Par. gr

I. 4 refers only to the putting on of two garments, Gobhila gr. 
( II. 1. 17-18 ) refers to bathing and putting on a garment, 
Manava gr. ( L 11. 4-6 ) refers to paridhapana and samnahana. 
Strangely enough Gobhila gr. II. 1. 10 speaks of the sprinkling 
of the girl's head with the best of sura ( wine ), which the 
commentator explains as water. 

Samanjana : ( anointing the bride and bride-groom ). Vide 
San. gr. L 12. 5, Gobhila gr. II. 2. 15, Par. gr. I. 4, in all of 
which Bg. X. 85. 47 is cited as the mantra with which anointing 
or sprinkling is done. 

Pratisarabandtia : ( tying an amulet string on the bride's 
hand ). Vide San. gr. I. 1 2, 6-8 ; Kausika sutra 76. 8. 

Vadhuvara-niskramana : ( the coming out into the pandal 
of the bride and bride-groom from the inner part of the house ). 
Par. gr. I. 4. 

Parasparasamiksana: ( looking at each other ). Vide Par. gr. 
L 4, Ap. gr. IV. 4, Baud, gr, I. 1. 24-25. Par. gr. I. 4 says that 
the bride-groom recites Rg. X. 85. 44, 40, 41 and 37 at this time. 
Ap. gr. IV. 4 and Baud. gr. say he recites Rg. X. 85. 44. The 
Asv. gr. parisista I. 23 says that first of all a piece of cloth is 
held between the bride-groom and bride and that at the proper 
astrological moment it is removed and then the two see each 
other. Laghu-Asvalayana-smrfci (15. 20) also says the same. 
This practice is observed even now. When the interposed cloth 
is held between the bride and brMe-groom verses called manga- 
lastakas are repeated by brahmanas, the last of which verses is 
'tad-eva lagnarh sudinam tad-eva ' &c. 

Kanyadana : ( the gift of the bride ). Vide Par. gr. I. 4, 
Manava gr. I. 8. 6-9, Varaha gr. 13. The Asv. gr. parisista 
sets out the procedure about the kanyadana which is the same 
even now. The Sam. K. p. 779 notes about half a dozen different 
methods of uttering the formula in kanyadana. It is in this 
rite that the father of the girl says that the bride-groom should 
not prove false to the bride in dharma, arfcha and kama and he 
responds with the words * I shall not do so' ( naticarami ). mi 
This is done even now.

534 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. IX 

Agnisthapana and homa: ( establishing the fire and offering 
of ajya oblations into fire ). Here there is great divergence 
about the number of ahutis and the mantras to be recited. Vide 
Asv. gr. I. 7. 3 and I. 4. 3-7, Ap. gr. V. 1 ( 16 ahutis with 
16 mantras), Gobhila gr. II. 1. 24-26, Manava gr. I. 8, Bhara- 
dvaja I. 13 &c. 

Panlgrahana : ( Taking hold of the bride's hand ). 

Lajahoma J (Offering of fried grain into fire by the bride ). 
Vide Asv. gr. I. 7. 7-13, Par. gr. I. 6, Ap. gr. V. 3-5, San. gr. 
I. 13. 15-17, Gobhila gr. II. 2. 5, Manava gr. I. 11. 11, Baud. gr. 
I. 4. 25. &c. Asv. gr. says that the bride makes three offerings of 
fried grain when mantras are repeated by the bridegroom and 
a fourth is made of the remaining lajas by the bride silently. 
Some others speak of only three offerings by the bride. 

Agniparirtayana : ( the bride-groom going in front takes the 
bride round the fire and water jar ). It is while doing this that 
he utters the words ' amohasmi ' &c. ( vide San. gr. I. 13. 4, Hir. 
gr. I. 20. 2 &c ). 

Aimarofiana : ( making the bride tread on a mill-stone ). 
These three are done thrice viz. lajahoma, then agnipari- 
nayana and asmarohana, one after another. 

Saptapadi : ( taking seven steps together ). This is done 
to the north of the fire; there are seven small heaps of rice and 
the bride-groom makes the bride step on each of these seven 
with her right foot beginning from the west. 

Murdhabhiseka : ( sprinkling holy water on the head of 
the bride and of the bride-groom according to some and on the 
head of the bride only according to others ). Asv. gr. I. 7. 20, 
Par. gr. I. 8, Gobhila gr. II. 2. 15-16 &c. 

Suryodiksana : ( making the bride look towards the sun ). 
Par. gr. I. 8 speaks of this and employs the mantra 'tac-caksur' 
( Rg. VII. 65. 16 = Vaj. S. 36. 24 ). 

Hrdayaspar&a : ( touching the bride' heart with a mantra ). 
Par. gr. I. 8, Bhar. gr. 1. 17, Baud. gr. I. 4. 1. 

Preksakanumantrana : ( addressing the spectators with 

reference to the newly married bride ). MSnava gr. I. 12. 1 

( whioh employs $g. X. 85. 33 ). Par. I. 8 employs that verse 
for reciting over the bride. 

DaksinUdana : ( gifts to the acarya ). Par. gr. I. 8, San. 
gr. 1. 14. 13-17 ( both prescribe a cow as the fee in the case of 



Gh. IX ] The ceremonies of Marriage 535 

brahmanas, a village in marriages of kings and nobles, a horse 
in marriages of vaiSyas &c. ). Gobhila gr. II. 3. 23, Baud. gr. 
I. 4. 38 speak of only a cow. 

OrJiapraveia : ( entering the bride-groom's house ). 

Orhapraveianiya homa : ( sacrifice on entering the bride- 
groom's house ). San. gr. 1. 16. 1-12, Gobhila gr. II. 3. 8-12, 
Ap. gr. VI. 6-10. 

Dhruvarundhatl'darkana : ( pointing out the Pole star and 
ArundhatI to the bride at night on the day of marriage ). K.hv. 
gr. I. 7. 22 speaks of the seven sages in addition, Manava gr. I. 
14. 9 speaks of the same three and adds Jlvantl, Bhar. gr. 1. 19 
speaks of Dhruva, ArundhatI and other naksatras, Ap. gr. VI. 
12 ( only Dhruva and ArundhatI), Par. I. 8 (only Dhruva). 
According to San. gr. I. 17. 2, Hir. gr. I. 22. 10 both the bride 
and the bride-groom remain silent till night. According to 
A6v. gr. only the bride does so. Gobhila gr. II. 3. 8-12 
describes Dhruvarundhatl-darsana before grhapravesa. 

Aqneya Sthalipaka : ( mess of cooked food offered to Agni). 
Vide Ap. gr. VII. 1-5, Gobhila II. 3. 19-21, Bhar. gr. I. 18, Hir. 
gr. I. 23. 1-6. 

Triratravrata : ( keeping for three nights after marriage 
certain observances). Vide A6v. above p. 530 for the observances 
which are enumerated by almost all sutrakaras. Ap. gr. VIII. 
8-10, Baud. gr. I. 5. 16-17 contain the interesting injunction 
that the newly married pair should sleep on the ground on the 
same bed for three nights, but should interpose between them a 
staff of udumbara wood anointed with perfumes and wrapped 
round with a garment or a thread and that on the fourth night 
it should be removed with the verses Rg. X. 85. 21-22 and 
thrown into water. 

Caturthikarma : ( rite on the fourth night after marriage ). 
This has been described above (pp. 202-204). 

In the medieval digests certain other ceremonies are 
mentioned and they are observed in modern times also. A few 
of them will be noted below. Here again the order is not the 
same in all works. The Dharmasindhu p. 265 refers to this 
divergence. 

Simantapujana : ( honouring the bride-groom and his party 
on their arrival at the bride's village ). This is done before 
vSgniscaya in modern times. Vide Sam. K. p. 768; Dharma- 
sindhu III. p. 261. 



536 History of Dharmasastra [ Ch. IX 

Gauri-Hara-puja : ( worship of Siva and his consort 
Gaurl ). Sam. K. p. 766, S. R. M. p. 534 and 544, Dharmasindhu 
p. 261 ( notes that there are several views as to when kanyadana 
takes place ) describe this. Images of Gaurl and Hara are to be 
made of gold or silver or pictures of them on a wall &c. or on a 
piece of cloth or stone are to be drawn and worshipped by the 
intending bride after punyahavacana and before kanyadana. 
Vide Laghu-Asvalayana 15. 35. 

Indranl'puja : (worship of IndranI, the consort of god 
Indra ). Vide Sam. K. p. 756, S. R. M. p. 545. This seems to 
have been comparatively an ancient practice as Kalidasa in 
Raghuvamsa VII. 3 seems to refer to it ( ' there was absence of 
disturbers of svayamvara on account of the presence of Sad'). 
Probably Sad was worshipped before the svayamvara began. 

Taila-haridraropaya : (Applying turmeric powder to the 
bride-groom's body from what is left after the bride's body has 
been so treated). Vide Sarh.K. p. 757, Dharmasindhu III. p. 257. 

Ardraksataropana : ( mutual showering of wet unbroken 
rice grains by the bride and bride-groom ). In a vessel of some 
metal like silver a little milk is poured and clarified butter 
is sprinkled over it and unbroken wet rice grains are poured 
therein. The bridegroom applies milk and ghee to the joined 
hands of the bride twice and thrice places rice grains in the 
joined hands of the bride so that her anjali becomes filled up 
and twice sprinkles ghee over her joined hands. Some other 
person does the same to the joined hands of the bride-groom and 
the bride's father places a golden piece on the joined hands 
of both. Then the bride-groom places his joined hands on those 
of the bride whose father then repeats a mantra and raises her 
up ; she then pours the rice over the head of the bridegroom 
who follows her in the same way. This is done thrice by each 
and then lastly by the bride ( i. e. seven times in all ). Then 
the priest sprinkles on their heads water with an udumbara 
twig together with durva grass after reciting verses ' Apo hi 
s^ha &c. ( Rg. X, 9. 1-3 ) \ Then the couple make a tilaka mark 
on each other's forehead, garland each other and tie a thread 
with a turmeric piece on each other's hand ( which is variously 
called * kankana-bandhana* or ' kautuka-bandhana* ). Vide Sam. 
Pr. pp. 828-829, S. R. M. p. 556. Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa VII 

describes ardraksata-ropana as the last of the rites of marriage 

and in VIII. 1 speaks of the kautuka. 



Ch. IX ] The ceremonies of Marriage 537 

Mangalasutra-bandhana : ( tying a string having golden and 
other beads on it round the neck of the bride ). This is now 
regarded as the most important ornament which no woman 
will part with as long a3 her husband is alive. But the sutras 
are entirely silent about it. Among the earliest references is 
one from Saunaka smrti l * 4Z (ms. in Bombay University Library, 
folio 39 b ). The Laghu-Asvalayana smrti 15. 33 also prescribes 
it and the mantra to be employed when doing so. Gadadhara on 
Par. gr. 1. 8 says that mahgala-sutra should be worn and garlands 
be placed round their necks by the bride and bride-groom, though 
the sutra of Paraskara is silent on the point. The Baud. gr. sssa 
sufcra V. 5 in describing * arkavivaha ' speaks of mangalya 
sutra to bo tied to the plant. It is not clear whether it means 
the same as the mangalasutra now tied by married women 
round their necks. About the nose-ring or nose ornament to 
which all women whoso husbands are living attach the greatest 
importance in modern times, the sutras, smrfcis and even the 
early digests are entirely silent. Dr. Altekar in his recent 
work ' Position of Hindu women in Hindu Civilization ' 
pp. 362-64 holds from the evidence of the sculptures throughout 
India-that the * nose-ring was unknown throughout the whole 
of India during the entire Hindu period ' ( i. e. till about 
1000 A. D. ). Mr. P. K. Gode in Annals of B. O. R. I. vol. XIX 
( for 1939 ) pp. 313-34 adduces evidence to show that a nose- 
ornament was known to literary works from at least about 
1000 A. D.-

lighted and requesting her and the relatives of the bride-groom 
to treat the bride affectionately). Vide Sam. K. p. 811, 
Dharmasindhu p. 267. A basket of bamboo ( vam&a ) is used 
probably to symbolize the continuity of the family (vamsa) of the 
bride-groom. This is done when the bride is about to leave the 
father's place to go to the bride-groom's place after marriage.

pp. 555-556. 

Two interesting questions arise viz. when can a marriage 
be said to be final and irrevocable and what would happen if a 
marriage is brought about by force or fraud. 

Manu says ( VIII. 168 ) * what is given by force, what 
is enjoyed by force, also what has been caused to be written 
by force and all other transactions done by force, Manu 
has declared void ; ' and in VIII. 165 he places fraudulent 
transactions on the same footing as those brought about by 
force. There is great difficulty in applying these dicta to 
marriages. We saw above that Vas. Dh. S, ( 17. 73 ) and 
Baud. Dh. S. declare that if a girl has been carried off by force 
and has not been wedded with the repetition of sacred texts 
she may be given to another man in marriage. Visvarupa 
( p. 74 ) and Apararka ( p. 79 ) add a gloss that this can be done 
only after she has undergone a prayascitta. From this it 
appears that if the marriage rites ( like saptapadl ) have been 
performed* the ancient law-givers would not have declared 
the marriage null and void even if the girl had been carried 
away by force or married by fraud. In modern works on 
Hindu Law the proposition is stated 1244 that * a marriage, 
though performed with the necessary ceremonies, may be set 
aside by the court, if it was brought about by force or fraud.' 
This opinion is based on what was said in gome decided cases 
e. g. Aunjona Dasi v. Prahlada Chandra ( 6 Bengal L. R. 243 
at p. 254), Venkatachargulu v. Eangacharyulu I. L. R. 
14 Mad. 316 at p. 320, Mulchand v. Bhudhia I. L. R. 
22 Bom. 812. But in none of these cases was a marriage duly 
solemnized by the performance of the rites of panigrahana, 
going round the fire and saptapadl, set aside. There are mere 

1244. Vide Mulla'a Hindu Law ( 9th ed. of 1940) p. 504. 



Ch. IX] When is Marriage irrevocable? 539 

obiter dicta in these cases to the effect that a marriage may be 
set aside by the court for force or fraud. 

The Vas. Dh. S. (17. 72) goes so far as to observe ' when a 
girl has been promised in marriage ( and the promise has been 
confirmed) with water, if the intended bride-groom dies, but the 
Vedic mantras have not been recited, that girl still belongs to 
her father ( and may be given to another) \ Katyayana 1845 . has 
a similar verse * if after choosing a girl as his bride, a man dies 
(or is unheard of) the girl after the lapse of three monthly 
periods may marry another*. And another verse of the same 
author says that if a person after giving a gratuity for a girl 
and strldhana to her goes abroad, the girl may be kept unmarried 
for a year and then may be given to another. Manu (VIII. 227) 
says * the Vedic mantras recited in the marriage rite are a sure 
indication of wife-hood; but their completion should be under- 
stood by the wise as occurring on taking the seventh step*. 
AparSrka p. 94 ( on Yaj. I. 65 ) quotes a similar verse from 
Narada (strlpumsa v. 3). The Udvahatatfcva p. 129 quotes 
Yama to the same effect. So it follows that the marriage be- 
comes complete and irrevocable the moment the saptapadl rite 
is performed, but before that rite is gone through there is a 
locus pcenitentice or a power to resile from what has been under- 
taken. Before the saptapadl is performed, if the bride-groom 
dies, the bride is still a maiden and not a widow and can be 
married again 1248 . The most essential ceremonies of marriage are 
the homa and saptapadl. The Dronaparva 1247 says that promise 
of a daughter and giving a daughter with water are not certain 
means of knowing wife-hood but saptapadl is known to be the 
completion of marriage. If any of the other ceremonies are 
wanting that would not vitiate the marriage. In I. L. R. 12 
Cal. 140, it has been held that the vrddhi-sraddha is not an 
essential ceremony and its absence would not vitiate marriage.

540 History of DharmaiUslra [ Ch. IX 

Even the Kamasutra 1248 quotes the unanimous opinion of the 
acaryas that marriages celebrated before fire as a witness cannot 
)e revoked. In the case of sudras'there are no Vedic mantras and 
jo in their case the completion of marriage will be determined 
iccording to custom. The digests like Gr. R say (p. 57) that 
In the case of siidras the marriage will be complete when the 
mdra girl holds the fringe of the garment of the bride-groom. 

Manu (IX. 47) declares 'once is the partition of inheri- 
tance made, once is a maiden given in marriage'. This rule 
really means that once the ceremony of marriage is completed 
by saptapadi, the marriage is irrevocable and the girl cannot 
thereafter be given to any one else. But if a girl is only 
promised in marriage and if a more worthy suitor subsequently 
presents himself, then the father may commit breach of promise 
and give her in marriage to another. Vide also Manu ( IX, 
71 and VIII. 98). Yaj. I. 65 states the rule and the exception 
* A girl is given only once ; a person who after having pro- 
mised to give, deprives that man of her, is liable to the 
punishment of a thief ; but if a more worthy suitor approaches, 
the father may deprive the former (suitor) of her (hand) though 
promised'. The Mahabharata ( Anusasana 44. 35 ) says that up 
to panigrahana any one may ask for the hand of a maiden 
( even though promised before to another ). Narada ( strlpumsa 
vv. 30 and 32) contains similar provisions. m9 Conversely, if a 
man agrees to marry a girl and subsequently discovers defects 
in her or if she is diseased or already deflowered or given by 
practising fraud he may refuse to marry her. Vide Manu 
IX. 72. If a guardian gives away a girl without declaring the 
defects of a girl ( and they are subsequently discovered ) the 
guardian should be fined in the highest ammercement (according 
to Yaj. I. 66 and the lowest, according to Narada, strlpumsa 
v. 33 ). Apararka 125 Â° ( p. 95 ) and others add that the defects 
referred to must be latent and not apparent or patent to view. 
If a suitor repudiates a girl who is free from defects he should 
be fined in the highest ammercement and if he falsely accuses 
her of defects he should be fined one hundred panas ( Yaj I, 66

and Narada, strlpuihsa v. 34). Narada adds that he who 
abandons a faultless girl should be punished and should be 
made to marry the same girl. 1251 

Some of the smrtis and digests are very much exercised 
over the question of the bride having menstruation while the 
marriage ceremonies are in progress and homa is about io be 
performed. AM m8 ( Jlvananda part 1, p. 11, chap. V ) pre- 
scribes that having made the girl bathe with the HavismatI 
( with a verse in which the word havis occurs, probably Rg. 
X. 88. 1 or VIII. 72. 1 ) and to put on other garments and having 
offered an ahuti of clarified butter with the verse ' Yufijate 
manah ' ( ftg. V. 81. 1 ) the ceremonies should be proceeded 
with. The Smrfcyarthasara ( p. 17 ) first quotes two verses ( the 
same as Atri's ) and proposes an alternative method viz. that the 
bride and the bride-groom should stay separate from each other 
for three days and on the fourth day after ceremonially bathing 
themselves should perform the homa in the same fire,

CHAPTER X 

MADHUPARKA AND OTHER USAGES 

Madhuparka : ( offering of honey by way of honour to a 
distinguished guest ). The word literally means * a ceremony in 
which honey is shed or poured ' ( on the hand of a person ). The 
word occurs in the Jaiminlya Upanisad-Brahmana l25S 18. 4. 
The Nirukta ( I. 16 ) also refers to the usage of offering madhu- 
parka with the word madhuparka repeated thrice. It appears 
that the Ait. Br. III. 4 when it says that * if the ruler of men 
comes as a guest or any one else deserving of honour comes, 
people kill a bull or a cow ( that has contracted a habit of 
abortion) ' refers to Madhuparka, 1BS1 though that word is not 
actually used. In all grhya surras it is described at length. 
Most of the details are the same, the principal difference being 
that often different mantras are prescribed, though some ( like 
the verse 4 mata rudranarn ' ) are the same. The* madhuparka 1255 
is offered to rtvtks ( priests officiating at sacrifices ) when they 
are chosen for a sacrifice, to a snataka who has come to one's 
house, to the king (who rules one's country, when he comes to 
one's house ), to one's acarya, father-in-law, paternal and 
maternal uncles. The Manava gr. ( I. 9. 1 ), Khadira gr. 
IV. 4. 21, Yaj. I. 110 say that six persons deserve arghya 
( madhuparka ) viz. rtvik, acarya, the bride-groom, the king, the 
snataka and a person who is dear to one. Some like Baud. 1f5<$ 
gr. I. 2. 65 add 4 atithi ' ( guest ). Vide Gaufc. V. 25, Ap. gr.

Maim III. 119, Sabhaparya 36. 23-24, Gobhila gr. IV. 10. 23-24. 
It is laid down that if the persons enumerated come to one's 
house within a year after madhuparka has been once offered, 
then it need not be offered again ( in the same year ), but when 
a marriage is being celebrated in one's house or a yajfia is 
being performed, then madhuparka must' be offered to those' 
persons ( even if one year has not elapsed since the madhu- 
parka was previously offered). Vide Gaut. V. 26-27, 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 8. 6, Taj. I. 110, Khadira gr. IV. 4. 26, 
Gobhila gr. IV. 10. 26. Btviks are to be honoured in each 
yajfia, even though several yajnas are performed in the 
same year ( Yaj. I. 110 ). Manu ( III. 120 ) says that a king and 
a snStaka are to be honoured with madhuparka only when they 
visit one's house in a yajfia. Visvarupa ( on Yaj. I, 109 ) says 
that madhuparka is to be offered to the king only and not to 
any ksatriya. Medhatithi on Manu III. 119 says that when 
a king, whether a ksatriya or not, comes to one's place madhu- 
parka was to be offered, but not to a sudra king. According to 
grhya-parisista the madhuparka is to be performed according to 
the rites prescribed in the sakha of the receiver and not of the 
giver. 1257 

The procedure of madhuparka is sot out from the Asv. gr. 1?58 
( I. 24. 5-26 ) " He pours honey into curds or clarified butter if no 
honey can be had. A seat, 1259 water for washing the feet, aryhya 
water ( i. e. water perfumed with flowers &c. ), water for 
acamana, honey mixture, a cow; every one of these they 
announce three times ( to the person who has arrived ). The 
person ( to be honoured ) should sit down on the seat made of 
northward pointed darbha grass with the verse 1260 'I am the 
highest one among my kindred, as the sun among lights ' 
( lightnings ). Here I tread on whomsoever bears enmity to me.' 
Or he should repeat this verse after ho has trodden on it. He

the water for sipping with the formula * thou art the seat ( or

parka, when it is being brought to him, with the mantra * I look

in the joined hands with the formula ' by the command (urging) 
of god Savitr, by the arms of Asvins and the hands of 
Pusan, I accept thee ' ( Vaj S. I. 24 ). He looks at it with the 
three rk verses 1862 * the winds blow honey to the righteous man ' 
( Rg. I. 90. 6-8 ). He ( takes it into his left hand ), stirs it about 
thrice from left to right with the thumb and the finger next to 
the smallest and wipes ( his fingers ) towards the east with the 
formula 'may the Vasus eat thee with the Gayatrl metre'; 
with the formula * may the Rudras eat thee with the Tristubh 
metre ' ( he wipes fingers ) towards the south ; with the formula 
4 may the Adityas eat thee with the JagatI metre ' towards the 
west ; with the formula ' may Visve Devas eat thee with the 
Anustubh metre ' towards the north ; with the formula 'to the 
bhutas ( beings ) thee ' he three times takes ( some of the 
madhuparka materials ) from out of the middle of it ( and 
throws it up ). He should partake of it for the first time with 
the formula 1262 ' the milk of Viraj art thou \ for the second time 
with ' may I obtain the milk of Viraj \ the third time with * in 
me may the milk of Padya Viraj dwell \ He should not eat 
the whole madhuparka and should not eat to satiety. He should 
give the remainder ( out of the madhuparka materials ) to a 
brahmana towards the north ; but if no brahmana is available 
he should throw it into water ; or he may eat the whole. He 
then takes acamana with the water intended for it with the

second time with the formula ' truth ! fame I fortune ! may- 
Fortune resort to me.' When he has sipped water, they announce 
to him the cow. Having muttered the words ' destroyed is my 
sin, my sin is destroyed \ he says * om, do it ' if he desires to 
have the cow killed ; if he 13 desirous of letting her go, he 
mutters the verse * the mother of Rudras and daughter of 
Vasus ' ,E64a ( $g. VIII. 101. 15 ) and says c let her go \ Let the 
madhuparka not be without flesh." 

A few small matters may be noted. Several grhya-sutras 
(such as the Manava) describe madhuparka as a part of the 
marriage rite, while others like Asv. describe it independently. 
Others like Hir. gr. ( I. 12-13 ) describe it as part of SamÂ£- 
vartana There is divergence about the substances mixed in 
offering madhuparka. Asv. gr, and Ap. gr. ( 13. 10 ) presoribe a 
mixture of honey and curds or clarified butter and curds. 
Others like Par. gr. I. 3 prescribe a mixture of three ( curds, 
honey and butter ). Ap. gr. ( 13. 11-12 ) states the view of some 
that those three may be mixed or five (those three with fried yava 
grain and barley ). Hir. gr. I. 12. 10-12 gives the option of 
mixing three or five ( curds, honey, ghee, water and ground 
grain ). The Kausrika sutra ( 92 ) speaks of nine kinds of 
mixtures viz. Brahma ( honey and curds ), Aindra ( of payasa ), 
Saumya (curds and ghee), Pausna (ghee and mantha), Sarasvata 
(milk and ghee), Mausala ( wine and ghee, this being used 
only in SautramanI and Rajasiiya sacrifices), Varuna (water 
and ghee ), Sravana ( sesame oil and ghee ), Parivrajaka (sesame 
oil and oil cake ). The Manava gr. I, 9. 22 says that the Veda 
declares that the madhuparka must not be without flesh and so 
it recommends that if the cow is let loose, goat's meat or payasa 
( rice cooked in milk ) may be offered ; the Hir. gr. I, 13. 14 
says that other meat should be offered; Baud. gr. says (I. 2. 51-54) 
that when the cow is let off, the flesh of a goat or ram may 
be offered or some forest flesh ( of a deer &c. ) may be offered, 
as there can be no madhuparka without flesh or if one is unable 
to offer flesh one may cook ground grains. As the cow became 
sacred, it became unthinkable to kill her and so other flesh was

offered. When even flesh-eating came fco be abhorred, then only 
payasa and such other things were recommended. The Adiparva 
(60.13-14) refers to Janamejaya's reception of Vyasa with 
madhupurka and Vyasa's letting the cow loose. This abhorrence 
of flesh-eating will be dealt with later on. In modern times 
there is generally no madhuparka except in marriage and then 
too it is a simple matter and the elaborate procedure prescribed 
in some of the grhya sutras is hardly ever followed. 

Certain peculiar ceremonies relating to marriage may now 
be described very briefly. In order to avert early widowhood 
( which was judged from her horoscope ) for the girl to be 
married, a ceremony called kurnbha-vivaha was performed. It 
is described in Sam. Pr. ( p. 868 ), Nirnayasindhu p. 310, Sam. 
K. ( p. 746 ), S. R. M. ( p. 528 ) and other works. On the day 
previous to the marriage a jar of water in which a golden 
image of Visnu is dipped is decked with flowers &c. and 
the girl is surrounded in a network of threads, Varuna and 
Visnu are worshipped and prayed to give long life to the 
intended bride-groom. Then the jar is taken out and broken in 
a pool of water and then water is sprinkled over the girl with 
five twigs and to the accompaniment of Rg. VII. 49 and then 
br&hmanas are fed. 

The Sam.Pr. (pp. 868-869) speaks of Asvatfcha-vivaha which 
is like kurnbha-vivaha and performed for good luck to the bride 
and averting widowhood. Here the Asvattha tree is substituted 
for the jar and a golden image of Visnu is worshipped. The 
image is then given to a brahman?*. 

Arkavivaha : When a man has the misfortune to lose by 
death two wives one after another, before marrying a third 
wife he goes through a ceremony of marriage with the arka 
plant. This is described in Sam. Pr. pp. 876-889, Sam. K. p. 819, 
Nirnayasindhu, p. 328. It is described in Baud. gr. sesasutra 
V. 5 also. 

Another question which takes up much space in ancient 
works but which is now of hardly any importance is parivedana* 
When a male got married before his elder brother or where a 
person married a younger girl before her elder sister was 
married, this act was called parivedana and was severely con. 
demned as a serious encroachment on the rights of seniority and 
as a sin. Gaut. 15. 18 and Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 5. 12. 22 ) declare that 
a younger brother married before an elder brother, and an elder 



Ch. X ] Parivedana 547 

brother married after a younger brother are sinners, and should 
not bo invited at a SrSddha. Ap. adds that one who marries a 
younger sister before her elder sister is married, one who marries 
an elder sister after the younger sister has been married, one 
whose younger brother has kindled the sacred fires or offered a 
soma sacrifice before him ( and a younger brother who kindles 
the sacred fires or offers soma sacrifice before his elder brother ) 
are also equally sinful. Vas. Dh. S. 1. 18, Visnu Dh. S. 37. 15-17 
also have similar provisions and Vas. Dh. S. ( 20. 7-10 ) pres- 
cribes krcchra penance of twenty days for the husband of the 
younger sister married before her elder sister and for the 
husband of the elder sister married after the younger one, 
requires each of them to offer his wife to the other for the sake 
of form ( to remove the slur ) and then to wed her again with 
his assent. 1265 Vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 40 also. The younger 
brother who marries before the elder brother is called parivetta! 
or parivividana ( Manu III. 171, Ap. Dh. S. 11." 5. 12. 22) or 
parivindaka ( Yaj. I. 223 ), the elder brother before whom the 
younger brother marries is called parivitta or parivinna or 
parivitti ( Manu III. 171 ), the younger sister who marries before 
the elder sister is called agredidhisu ( Gaut. 15. 15, Vas. 1. 18 ) 
or parivedini, the elder sister before whom her younger sister 
marries is called didhisu. The husbands of these two last 
respectively bear the appellations agre-didhisupati and didhi- 
supati. The father or other guardian who gives away the girl 
in any of these cases of parivedana is called paridayl or 
paridata. The younger brother who kindles the sacred fire 
before the elder is styled ' paryadhatr ' and the elder brother 
who is so treated is called ' paryahita * ( Gaut. 15. 18 ). Manu 
III. 172 ( which is almost the same as Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 30 and 
Visnu Dh. S. 54. 16 ) says that the parivetfca, the parivitta, the 
girl whom the younger brother marries before the elder, the 
man who gives away the girl in marriage and the officiating 
priestâ these five all fall into hell 1866 ( and must perform the 
penance of Candrayana according to Visnu ). The Mit. on

before the elder sister. 



548 History of Lharmaiastra [ Oh. X 

Yfij. III*. 265 quotes Harlta-dharmasutra on this topic to the 
same effect. Medhatithi on Manu III. 171 refers to the view of 
some that if a son kindles the sacred fire before* his father, 
the same rule applies as between brothers and then refutes that 
view. Apararka p. 446 quotes Usanas that a person may 
kindle sacred fires even before his father or grandfather with 
the latter's consent. The Trikandamandana ( I. 76-77 ) says that 
there is no sin in taking agnihotra and performing a sacrifice 
before an elder brother and the incurring of sin is only 
restricted to marriage, while the Smrtyartbasara (p. 13 ) holds 
the opposite view that one should not kindle the Vedic fires 
before one's father even with the latter's consent. The Visnu 
Dh. S. ( 37. 15-17 ) enumerates parivedana among upapatakas. 
Gaut. ( 18. 18-19 ) prescribes that if an elder brother has gone 
to a foreign country his younger brother must wait twelve 
years before he takes a wife or kindles sacred fires or six years 
according to some. 1267 There is a similar text of Vas. quoted 
by Apararka p. 445. 

In certain cases marrying or kindling sacred fires before an 
elder brother is not condemned. Medhatithi on Manu III. 171 
quotes a verse 'One need not wait where the elder brother is 
a lunatic, or is a sinner, or leprous, impotent, or suffering from 
tuberculosis' and remarks that this is only illustrative (i. e. 
one need not wait where the elder brother has no adhikara for 
marriage or for kindling fires) ms . Vide Atri v. 105 ( Anan. ed- ) 
for a similar verse. Another verse of Atri (v. 106) says that 
there is no blemish in marrying before the elder brother, if the 
latter is impotent or gone abroad, or patita or has become a 
recluse or is devoted to Yogasastra 12<9 . Vide Gobhila smrti 
( I. 72-74 ) for similar verses (which are quoted by the Gr. B. 
p. 90), Trikandamandana I. 68-74, Smrtyarthasara p. 13 and 
Sam. Pr. pp. 760-766. 

The ideas about the wrong committed by a younger brother 
or sister marrying before an older one reach far back into Vedic 
antiquity. In the Tai. Br. ( III. 2. 9 ) there is a story that the 
gods transferred (rubbed off) their sin to the Apyas and then

there is a succession of persons who are all guilty of blame or 
sin and each preceding one among whom is said to have passed 
it on to eaoh succeeding one viz. suryabhyudita, suryabhinim- 
rukta, kunakhin, syavadat, agredidhisG, parivitta, vlrahan, brah* 
mahan. The Vas. Dh. mo S. 1. 18 arranges persons called sinners 
( enasvin ) almost in the same order as in the Tai. Br. Here ( in 
Tai. Br. ) we have parivitta and agredidhisu. In another passage 
of the Tai. Br. (III. 4. 4) while speaking of Purusamedha, it is 
said that the parivitta is consigned as a victim to ill-luck 
(nir-rti), the parivividana to distress (arti) and the didhisupati 
to non-success ( araddhi ). 






CHAPTER XI 

POLYGAMY, POLYANDRY AND RIGHTS 
AND DUTIES ON MARRIAGE 

Polygamy: Though monogamy 1B71 seems to have been fche 
ideal and was probably fche rule, the Vedic literature is full of 
references to polygamy, Rg. X. 145 (same as Atharvaveda 
III. 18 ) is a hymn meant as a charm for weaning the husband's 
affections from a co-wife. It occurs in the Ap. M. P. ( I. 15 ) 
and Ap. gr. IX. 6-8 prescribes it for winning over the husband 
to oneself and for causing estrangement between him and one's 
co-wife. Rg. X. nn 159 is a hymn attributed to Sad, wife of 
Indra, who claims to have vanquished and killed her co-wives 
and to rule supreme over Indra and all men. This hymn also 
occurs in Ap. M. P. ( I. 16 ) and is prescribed by the Ap. gr. 
( IX. 9 ) as a charm always to be repeated by a wife for sup- 
pressing her co-wives. In a verse ( Rg. I. 105. 8 ) Trita who 
had fallen into a well declares 4 the rib-like sides ( of the well ) 
cause me pain all round as co-wives make it too hot ( for the 
husband or for themselves ) ' im . The Tai. S. ( VI. 6. 4. 3 ) gives 
a dogmatic and somewhat picturesque explanation of polygamy 
that 'on one sacrificial post he passes round two girdles, so one 
man secures two wives; that he does not pass one girdle round 
two posts, so one wife does not obtain two husbands'. The 
Ait. Br. ( 12. 11 ) similarly declares ' therefore one man has 
many wives, but one wife has not many husbands at the

same 1874 time \ The Tai. Br. (III. 8. 4.) when speaking of the Assiva- 
medha says 'the wives anoint (the horse); wives are indeed a 
form of prosperity * 1275 . la the Sat. Br. ( XIII. 4. 1. 9., S. B. E. 
vol. 44, p. 349 ) it is said, 'four l276 wives are in attendance viz. 
the consecrated queen {mahisi), the favourite wife (vavata), 
the discarded wife (parivrkta or parivrkti) and the palagall 
(who is low-born)'. The Tai. S. I. 8. 9 refers to the mahisl 
and parivrkti. In the Vaj. S. (23. 24, 26, 28) there are verses 
which are addressed to the mahisl, vavata and parivrkti by the 
brahma, udgata and hota priests respectively. Hariscandra is 
said to have had a hundred wives ( Ait. Br. 33. 1 ). It is not to be 
supposed that polygamy was confined only to kings and nobles. 
The great philosopher Yajfiavalkya had two wives, KatyayanI 
who was worldly-minded and Maitreyl who thirsted for the 
knowledge of brahma and immortality ( Br. Up. IV. 5. 1-2 and 
II. 4. 1 ). 

In the times of the sutras, some sages wanted to hold up a 
high ideal. The Ap. Dh. 8. ( II. 5. 11. 12-13 ) declares that when 
a man has a wife who is endowed with dharma and progeny, 
he shall not marry another wife ; but if any one of the two 
( dharma and progeny ) is wanting ( in the case of the wife ), 
he may marry another before he has consecrated the sacred 
srauta fires. In another place Ap. (I. 10. 28. 19 ) prescribes 
that one who abandons his ( faultless ) wife should put on the 
skin of an ass with the hair outside and should beg for alms 
at seven houses for six months. im Narada( strlpumsa v. 95 )

recommends that the king should bring round to the proper 
path by inflicting heavy fines a husband who abandons a wife 
that is obedient, not harsh of tongue, vigilant ( in household 
work ), chaste and endowed with sons. Even Kaut. ( III. 2 ) 
prescribes that a husband should wait for eight years (before 
marrying another) if his wife gives birth to no child after one 
delivery or is sonless or is barren; he should wait for ten 
if she bears only still-born children, twelve years if she gives 
birth to daughters only. Then if he is anxious for a son he 
may marry another. If he violates these rules he must pay her 
gratuity, some wealth as strldhana and money ( prescribed to be 
given) on supersession and besides a fine (to the king ) of 
24 panas \ 12T8 So far Kau^ilya appears to have only stated the 
ideal, because he follows up this remark by another statement 
which probably represented the commonly held popular view 
*a man may marry several wives after giving iulka and 
strldhana to those to whom nothing had been given at the time 
of marriage and money on supersession ( adhivedanika ) and 
suitable provision for livelihood ; for women are ( married ) 
for procreating sons.' Though Ap. and others held up 
the ideal of monogamy and Narada and others prescribed a 
fine for marrying a second wife without sufficient cause, 
it is extremely doubtful whether a man was ever punished by 
the king for so doing. Manu V. 80 and Yaj. I. 80 both say that 
a husband may supersede a wife (and marry another) if she 
drinks wine, suffers from a disease (of long standing), is 
deceitful, is extravagant in expenditure, speaks harsh words, 
and gives birth to female children only. Manu V. 81 and 
Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 65 allow a husband to marry another woman 
,at once if the first is harsh of tongue. Devala ma quoted in the 
Gr. R. says that the sudra may have only one wife, a vaisya 
two, a ksatriya three and a brahmana four, but a king may have 
as many as he desires. This only reflected the prevailing 
practice of kings. The Adiparva mo gravely remarks ' to have 
many wives is no adharma on the part of men, but to violate 

1278. Vide Manu IX. 81 and Band. Dh. S. II. 2. 65 for similar 
periods of waiting. Vide Yaj. II. 148 for the amount of adhivedanika 
to be given by the husband.

the duty owed to the first husband would be a great adh&rma in 
the case of women.' The Mahabharata ( Mausala-parva V. 6 ) 
tells us that Vasudeva 1281 ( Krsna ) had sixteen thousand wives. 
Several kings had in historic times as many as a hundred wives. 
For example, the Cadi king Gangeyadeva alias Vikramaditya 
is said to have obtained mukli ( salvation ) at Prayaga with his 
hundred wives 1882 (vide Jabalpur plate of Yasahkarnadeva dated 
1122 A. D. in E. I. vol. II. p. 4 and the Khaira plates of the same 
king in E. I. vol. XII. p. 205). In Bengal the evils of Kulinism 
are well known. The reasons for this treatment of women were 
many, such as the great spiritual importance of sons, early marria- 
ges and consequent illiteracy of women, the spread of the idea of 
the ceremonial impurity of women and their being equated with 
sudras and lastly the idea of the complete dependence of women 
on men. O ne must not be carried away , however, by the notion that 
marrying many wives was either very common or was not looked 
down upon. Steele (in 'Law and Custom of Hindoo Castes,' first 
published in 1826) who had the most unique opportunities for 
observing the practices of numerous castes in the Dekhan in the 
first decades of the 19th century writes (p. 168, ed. of 1868) 'a man 
may marry as many wives as his inclination or circumstances 
allow. Marriages in succession, in consequence of the death 
of a former wife, are very common ; but polygamy is not 
usual except on account of the barrenness of the first wife. It is 
practised in the Koonbee castes '. Vide also Imperial Gazetteer 
of India, vol. I ( ed. of 1907) p. 482 'Although in theory 
polygamy is allowed, in practice a second wife is rarely taken 
while the first is alive and in India as a whole there are only 
1011 wives to every 1000 husbands so that even if no husbands 
have more than two wives all but 11 per thousand must be 
monogamous '. The state of the modern case law is unsatis- 
factory. The Bombay High Court has held that the mere fact 
that the husband has married a second wife would not entitle 
the first wife to refuse to stay with the husband. Vide Motilal 
v. Chanchal, 4 Bom. L. R. 107. In Virasami v. Appasami, 1 
Madras High Court Reports, p. 375, the court held that a Hindu 
may marry any number of wives, although he may have a wife 
or wives living. It is submitted with great respect that that is

not the ideal or the view of the best; writers, nor is such a view 
held by the majority of Indian jurists of ancient and medieval 
times. Modern opinion of educatod people is most favourable 
to making marriages monogamous and efforts are being made 
to secure absolute monogamy by legislative action. For 
example, the Madras Nambudri Act ( Madras Act XXI of 1933 ) 
forbids a Nambudri brahmana from marrying a second wife 
when the first is living except in three cases viz. (1) when the 
first wife is afflicted with an incurable disease for over five 
years, (2) when she has not borne a child within ten years of 
marriage, and (3) when she becomes an outcast. 

Polyandry 

The passages cited above (note 1274) from the Ait. Br. and 
the Tai. S. that a woman cannot have several husbands at the 
same time make it clear that in those ancient times polyandry 
was unheard im of. Not a single Yedic passage can be 
cited which clearly refers to the practice of polyandry. The 
most glaring example of polyandry in Sanskrit literature is 
that of DraupadI as the wife of the five Pandavas. Probably 
the tradition was too firmly rooted to allow the author to ignore 
it. The Mahabharata shows that all were shocked by the 
resolve of Yudhisthira to make DraupadI the wife of the five 
brothers. Dhrstadyumna ( Adiparva im 195. 27-29 ) tries 
vehemently to dissuade Yudhisthira, who tries to justify his 
action on the ground of ancient practice and the agreement of 
the brothers to share everything that any one of them may 
secure. But Yudhisthira could 1285 ferret out ( Adi. chap. 196 ) 
only two instances ( rather mythical ) in support of the practice 
viz. of Jatila GautamI ( who had seven sages as husbands ) and 
of Varksl who had ten Pracetasa brothers as husbands. It is 
this fact that has led many scholars to regard the Pandus as a 
non-Aryan tribe somehow grafted on the Aryan stock and 
represented as relatives of the Kauravas by the editor of the

MahabhSrata. This too also sounds somewhat far-fetched. 
Kumarilabhatta in his Tantravartika cuts this Gordian knot by 
putting forward three explanations, one of which boldly asserts 
that there were many Draupadls very similar to each other and 
so the epic figuratively speaks of one Draupad! only. 1286 There 
were really five Draupadls (and not one) married separately to 
the five Pandavas. In the Dharmasastra works there are traces 
of the knowledge of the practice of polyandry. Ap. Dh. S/- 
(II. 10. 27. 2-4) refers to it; * One shall not make over (his wife ) to 
strangers ( for a son by niyoga), but only to one who is a sagotra ; 
for they declare that a bride is given to the family (of brothers' 
and not to one brother alone ) ; that ( niyoga ) is forbidden on 
account of the weakness of men's senses/ Similarly Brhaspati, 
while illustrating the proposition that the king should not disturb 
popular usages even though they may be improper, cites 
several such practices among which he mentions * In some other 
countries there is the most reprehensible practice of a brother 
taking ( as wife ) the widow of his deceased brother, and the 
practice of delivering a maiden to a family ; similarly among 
the Paraslkas ( Persians ) matches with a mother are seen \ 1287 
Dr. Jolly is wrong in thinking that Brhaspati refers to 
polyandry as practised in the south. Brhaspati first referred 
to the practice of marrying a maternal uncle's daughter as 
prevalent amongst the southerners ( daksinatyas ) in his day 
and then adds that a practice of giving a girl to the family is 
in vogue in other countries. So he clearly means countries other 
than those of the daksinatyas- Prof. Keith appears to follow 
Dr. Jolly without any independent examination of the original 
passage (in E. R E. vol. 8 on marriage, p. 453). Just as Brhaspati 
refers to the Paraslkas, he speaks of polyandry as current 
among other countries ( but not Aryan India). There are two 
types of polyandry, 1288 one matriarchal ( where a woman forms 
simultaneous alliances with two or more men who are not 
necessarily relations of each other and therefore succession is

traced through the female ) and the other fraternal, where a 
woman becomes the wife of several brothers. The former 
practice once prevailed among the Nairs on the Malabar coast, 
but it has now died out. The latter form of polyandry is still 
to some extent found in Kumaon, Garhwal and among peoples 
in the Himalayan area up to Assam. 1289 Pandit Bhagwanlal 
Indraji (I. A. vol. 8, p. 88) says that in Kuraaun between the Tons 
and Jumna river about Kalsi, Rajputs, brahmanas and siidras 
all practise polyandry and the children are attributed to the 
eldest brother who is alive. NUakantha, 1290 the commentator 
pf the Mahabharata, raises ( on Adiparva 104. 35 ) the question 
kbout Draupadl's marrying five husbands and refers to the 
(practice among very low castes in his day of one woman 
having two or three husbands.

Manu ( IX. 101-102 ) lays down in a concise form the obli- 
gations of husband and wife viz. 'they should not prove false to 
each other till death ( as regards dharma, artha and kama ) and 
that their constant endeavour should be not to be separate from 
each other and not to break faith with each other ( as to those 
three goals of human life)'. The detailed rights and duties of 
the husband and wife will be unfolded as we proceed. 

The first duty of the husband and the privilege of the wife 
was to require and to give respectively her co-operation in all 
religious acts. This has been so from the most ancient times. 
In Bg. I. 72. 5 it is said 1891 that 4 they, accompanied by their 
wives, worshipped the fire who is worthy of worship*. In 
another place it is said * when you make the husband and wife 
of one mind, they anoint thee with ghee like a well-placed 
friend \ In the Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 occurs a passage 'may the wife 
unite with her husband by means of the good deeds ( done by

both ), they two became yoked like oxen to the sacrifice ; may 
the two be of one mind and destroy their foes ; may they attain 
non-aging light in heaven*. The same verse with slight 
variations occurs in the Kathaka Sam. V. 4 and is relied 
upon by Sahara on Jaimini VI. 1. 21. This indicates that 
they were supposed to enjoy the fruits of their actions 
together. We saw above (p. 551) how in the Asivamedha the wife 
anoints the horse, how in marriage the bride offers handfuls 
of fried grain into fire. It has already been seen ( note 1208 ) 
that the Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 6. 13. 17-19 ) requires that from the 
time of marriage the husband and wife work together in 
religious acts, that they share the reward of such acts together 
and that they both have dominion over the wealth of the family 
and that the wife can make gifts in the absence of the husband 
if occasion necessitates. The Aiv. gr. ( 1. 8. 5 ) prescribes 1892 that 
the fire kindled at marriage is carried by the married pair to 
their home ( in a vessel ) and that ( I. 9. 1^8 ) since the day of 
marriage, the husband should" w!5t ship the domestic fire himself 
or his wife or his son or his daughter or pupil (may offer 
worship iiftm absence ), that if fire goes out, some teachers say 
that the wife should observe a fast, the domestic fire should 
be worshipped in the evening with an ahuti and the formula 
1 agnaye svaha' and in the morning with an ahuti and the 
formula 'suryaya svaha' and there is to be a second oblation 
each time silently (to Prajapati). According to the commen- 
tator some said that the wife and daughter oould not perform 
the homa as they had no privilege to learn mantras, that they 
could only kindle the fire, while others said they could do so. In 
the grhya fire kindled at marriage one was to offer the daily 
mahayajfias (Gaut. 5. 6-8) and as regards baliharana, Gobhila gr. 
(I. 4. 16-19 ) says that both husband and wife should offer baits , 
or a brahmana may offer for them, or the wife may offer in the 
evening and the husband in the morning m *. Manu ( III. 121 ) 
says that from food cooked in the evening the wife should

offer balis, but without mantras. This shows that though gradu- 
ally women began to lose the right to repeat Vedic mantras ( as 
shown by Manu), still she had a hand in the religious rites. 
She had to perform many acts in sacrifices, such as unhusking 
grain in sthallpaka (vide Hir. gr. I. 23. 3), washing the 
slaughtered animal ( compare Sat. Br. III. 8. 2 and Qobhila gr 
III. 10. 29 ), looking at the ajya in srauta sacrifices. The 
Purvamlmarhsa lm (VI. 1. 17-21) establishes that both husband 
and wife own property and should join together in performing 
sacrifices, but that the male saorificer alone is ordinarily to 
do every act in all religious ceremonies except such matters as 
are expressly declared to be performed by the wife also or alone 
(as e. g. observing celibacy, uttering benediction &c.). It is on 
account of the necessity of associating the wife in all religious 
acts that the hero Rama was compelled to celebrate sacrifices with 
a golden image of Slta by his side. 1295 Panini ( IV. 1.33 ) derives 
the word patni and says that it can be only applied to a wife who 
shares in the sacrifice ( and its reward ). It follows that wives 
who are not or cannot join with their husbands in yajfias are 
only jay as or bharyas ( but not patnls ). The Mahabhasya 
says 1296 that the wife of a sudra is called patni only by 
analogy ( as a stidra himself has no adhikara for yajfia, his wife 
can much less have it). It is on account of this close association 
of the wife in all sacrifices ( either srauta or smarta ) that the 
wife if she dies before her husband is burnt with the sacred 
fire or fires and with the sacrificial vessels and implements 
( Manu V. 167-168, Yaj. I. 89 ). The Tai. Br. III. 7. 1 says 
' half of the sacrifice is destroyed in the case of that sacrificer 
whose wife is (in her monthly course and therefore) unavailable 
on the sacrificial day.' 1297 

But the wife is not authorized to do religious acts indepen- 
dently of her husband or without his consent. Manu ( V. 155 = 
Visnu Dh. S. 25. 15 ) ordains ' there is no separate yajna for

women ( independently of the husband ) nor vrata ( vows ) nor 
fastÂ© (without his consent).' Similarly Katyayana propounds 1891 
a sweeping rule ' whatever a woman does to secure spiritual 
benefit after death without the consent of her father ( when she 
is unmarried ), or her husband or her son, becomes fruitless for 
the purpose intended. ' Vide also Veda-Vyasa smrti II. 19. 
The Nityacarapaddhati (p. 329) quotes Manu V. 155 and 
remarks that Manu's words are not to be taken literally but 
are only meant to extol the eminence of the husband. 

Very detailed rules were laid down as to precedence 
among wives, if a man married several women. Visnu Dh. S. 
( 26. 1-1 ) concisely gives all the rules. 1899 If all the wives 
are of the same caste, then the wife whose marriage took 
place first was to be associated with the husband in all 
religious acts ; if a man had wives of different varnas 
( when inter-caste marriages were allowed ) the wife of 
the same varna with the husband had precedence, though 
her marriage might have been later in date. If there is 
no wife of the same varna as himself, the husband may associate 
with himself in religious rites even a wife of the varna imme- 
diately next to his own ; but a dvijati should never associate a 
sudra wife with himself in religious ceremonies. Vide 
Madanaparijata p. 134 for similar rules. Vas. Dh. S, 18. 18 
expressly says ' a woman belonging to the dark varna ( i. e. 
sudra ) is meant only for pleasure and not for performance of 
' religious rites \ im Gobhila smrti ( T. 103-104 ) contains rules 
similar to those in Visnu Dh. S.,Yaj. I. 88 and Veda-Vyasa 
II. 12 are to the same effect. Visvarupa on Yaj. remarks 
that though the eldest wife alone is entitled to take part in 
religious rites, all wives (except a sudra wife) may be cremated 
with the srauta fire. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 165. In the Purvaml- 
mamsa ( IX. 3. 20-21 ) Jaimini discusses the question whether

should be modified into the dual or plural when the sacrificer 
( in a model sacrifice or its modifications ) has two or more 
wives and establishes that no change is required. The Trikan- 
damandana ,201 ( I. 43-44 ) says that there were three views when 
a man had several wives viz. some said that all should be 
associated with him in religious rites, others held that only the 
eldest wife of the same varna should be associated and the third 
view was that the husband should never associate with himself a 
wife whom he married for pleasure after he kindled the sacred 
fires. Manu ( IX. 86-87 ) lays down that the wife of the same 
caste with the husband should always have precedence not only 
in the obligatory religious rites, but also in ministering to the 
physical comfort of the husband and if a brahmana husband 
gets these done by a wife of another caste when the wife of the 
same caste is near, he becomes like a candala. 

From very ancient times one of the articles of faith was 
that a man was born with debts, that he owed three debts to 
sages, gods and pitrs and that by brahmacarya (student-hood), 
by performing yajfias and by procreating sons he freed himself 
from those three debts respectively. Vide noi Tai. S. VI. 3. 10. 5, 
Sat. Br. I. 7.2.11, Ait. Br. 33.1. The last very succinctly states the 
purposes served by a son viz. payment of the debt to ancestors, 
the securing of immortality and heaven. Rg, V. 4. 10 (prajabhir- 
agne amrtatvam-asyam) prays 'may I obtain immortality through 
progeny.' Vas. Dh. S. 17. 1-4 quotes these passages of the 
Tai. S. t Ait. Br. and Rg. The Rg. X. 85. 45 invokes the 
blessing of ten sons on the newly married bride and the Rg. is 
full of the yearning for a son at every step. Vide Rg. I. 91. 20, 
I. 92. 13, III. 1. 23 &c. Jaimini (VI. 2. 31 ) ,S03 discusses the 
passage of the Tai S. and arrives at the conclusion that the 
duties laid down in it are obligatory and not left to choice and 
Sabara adds another explanation that these duties are obliga- 
tory on all dvijatis and the word 4 brahmaiia ' is used in the

Tai. S. as illustrative only. Manu ( VI. 35 ) enjoins upon 
a man that he should not think of moksa (release from samsSra) 
before he has paid off the three debts and ( IX 106 ) further 
says that by the very birth of the eldest son a man becomes 
free from the debt owed to ancestors. Manu ( IX. 137 ), Vas. 
17. 5, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46 contain the same verse proclaiming 
that a man attains all (heavenly) worlds by means of a son 
and Manu IX. 138, Adi. 129. 14, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 44 declare that 
a putra is so called because he saves his father from the hell 
called put The Nirukta II. 11 ,204 also derives the word putra 
similarly. Further the water and pindas ( balls of cooked rice ) 
offered by the son to his father and other deceased ancestors 
were supposed to be of great efficacy for the peace of the 
souls of the departed. The Visnu Dh. S. 85. 70, 1205 Vanaparva 
84. 97, Matsyapurana 207. 39 contain a verse 4 one should desire 
to have many sons in the hope that one of them may repair to 
GayS.' On account of these several benefits conferred by a son, 
the highest importance was attached to the birth of a son. 
The wife helped a man to discharge two of his debts, to the 
gods by associating with him in sacrifices and to the pitrs 
by procreating a son or sons. Therefore the goal of the life 
of women was declared to bo to get married and procreate sons. 
This was so much the case from very ancient times that even 
the Sat. Br. (V. 3. 2. 2, S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 65 ) says that the sonless 
wife is possessed with Nir-rti ( ill luck or Destruction ). 
Manu ( IX 96 ) says ' women are created for procreation and 
men have to propagate ( the race ) : therefore in the Veda it is 
deolared that the wife shares in common ( with the husband ) 
the performance of religious duties \ Narada ( strlpurhsa v. 19 ) 
also declares that women are created for ( prooreating ) children. 
It was on account of these ideas about the goal of woman's life 
and the supreme importance of a son that the smrtis and 
dharma-sutra works recommended or allowed the husband to 
marry a second time even when the first wife was living. 

All the smrtis, puranas and the digests devote a great deal 
of space to the duties of a wife. It would be impossible to set 
them out in detail. A few striking passages alone will be cited. 
All are agreed that the foremost duty of a wife is to obey her

husband and to honour him as her god. In the &at Br. wof princess 
Sukanyft when married to the old and decrepit sage Cyavana to 
mollify the sage who had been wronged by her brothers says â  I 
shall not forsake my husband, while he is alive, to whom my 
father gave me * ( IV. 1. 5. 9 ). Sankha-Likhita im say ' a wife 
should not hate her husband even if he be impotent ( or have 
swollen testicles), patita (guilty of mahapataka and so an outcast), 
ievoid of a limb or diseased, since the husband is the god of 
women/ Manu declares ( V. 154 ) ' a virtuous wife should serve 
tier husband as if he were a god, whether he be of evil character, 
or lustful ( loving another woman ) or devoid of good qualities * 
5Taj. 1. 77 enjoins upon women ' this is the highest duty ( dharma ) 
of women that they should obey their husband's words 5 if he is 
guilty of some mortal sin, they should wait till he is purified 
(and thereafter be dependent on bis words)'. The Ramayana 
(Ayodhya-kSnda 24. 26-27) remarks 'the husband is the god 
and the master of the wife, while she is alive and she obtains 
the highest heaven by serving her husband.' The Mahabha"- 
rata very frequently harps upon the duties of wives. 1808 The 
Anutesana parva 146, 55 says 'the husband is the god of 
a woman, her ( sole ) relative, her goal ' ; the 5.6vamedhika- 
parva 90. 51 declares * the husband is the highest deity. ' 'The 
father gives only what is limited, the brother and the son do 
the same; what woman would not worship the husband 
who gives what is unlimited or immeasurable I * ( Santiparva 
148. 6-7 ). The Matsyapurana 210:18 contains this last verse 
and adds ' the husband is the god for women and is their 
highest goal. ' This idea of the wife's entire submission to the

husband is voiced even by poets like Kalidasa, 1 * 09 wbomalrea 
one of the pupils of Kanva say about Sakuntala ' this is your 
wife, abandon her or accept her, since all-round domination of 
the husband over the wife is proper.' Manu V. 150-156, Yaj. 
I. 83-87, Visnu Dh. S. 25. 2 ff, Yan^arva2aajL 9-58 ( P raugadt 
asjthe speaker ), AnuSfisana 123 (Sfindill declares the conduct 
of virtuous wives ), Veda-Vyasa-smrti II. 20-32 ( wife's duties 
from morning till night ), Vrddha-H&rlta XL 84 ff ( wife's 
duties from morning ), Sm. C. ( vyavahara section ) p. 249 ff f 
Madanaparijata pp. 192-195 and other nibandhas dwell at length 
upon the duties of the wife. A few of such duties may be 
indicated here. 

According to Manu V, 150 ' a wife should always present 
a smiling face, should be alert and clever in her domestic 
duties, should keep domestic vessels well burnished and 
clean and should not be extravagant in spending.' Manu 
IX. 11 asks the husband to set to his wife the task of con- 
serving the wealth acquired and looking to its expenditure, of 
keeping things clean, of the performance of religious acts, 
of cooking food and of taking care of household paraphernalia* 
Manu ( IX 13 ) adds that drinking wine, company of bad 
people, staying away from the husband, wandering about ( to 
tirthas or elsewhere ), sleep ( by day ), staying in the house 
of strangersâ these six spoil married women. Adiparva 74. 12 
gives 1810 expression to the popular notion that people do not 
like married women staying with their paternal relatives 
for a long time away from their husbands, since such 
a stay leads to loss of good name and character. The 
same sentiment is echoed by K&lidasa in the Sakuntala ( V. 17 ). 
The Markandeyapurana 77. 1? is to the same effect. Yaj. 
( I. 83 and 87 j requires the , wife to keep household utensils and 
furniture in their proper pla8&, to be olever, to have a smiling 
face, to be unextravagant, to be devoted to doing what is 
agreeable and beneficial to the husband, to show respect to her 
father-in-law and mother-in-law by olasping their feet; to

conduct herself decently, to restrain her senses.' Sankha ,3n 
lays down what is decent conduct for a wife ' she should not go 
out of the house unless she is asked ( by her husband or elders ) 
nor without putting on an upper garment ; she should not walk 
fast; she should not speak with a male who is unrelated to her, 
except a trader, a sarhnyasin, an old man or a physician ; she 
should not allow her navel to be seen ; she should wear her 
garment ( or sari ) in suoh a way that it may reach down to her 
ankles; she should not expose her breasts, she should not 
laugh loudly without covering her mouth ( with her hand or 
her garment ) ; she should not hate her husband or his relatives ; 
she should not be in the company of dancing girls, gambling 
women, women who make assignments to meet lovers, female 
ascetics, female fortune-tellers, women who live by tricks, 
magical and secret rites and who are of bad character ; since 
(the wise declare that) the character of women of good family is 
spoilt by the company (they keep). ' The Visnu Dh. S. 25. 1-6 
ordains ' now then the duties of wives (are declared); they 
should perform the same vratas ( observances and vows ) which 
the husband undertakes ; they should honour the mother-in-law, 
the father-in-law, other elders, gods, guests and keep the house- 
hold utensils well arranged ; they should not be extravagant 
in giving to others ; should keep the goods well guarded ; they 
should have no liking for magical practices (to win love) 
and should be devoted to auspicious conduct.' Vide 
also Visnu Dh. S. chap. 99 last two verses ( quoted by 
AparSrka p. 107 ). DraupadI ( Vanaparva chap. 233 ) states 
4 whatever my husband does not eat, drink or partake of, I 
avoid. I know the total wealth, the income and expenditure of 
the Pandavas'. The Kamasutra directs the wife to make expendi- 
ture that will be commensurate with the yearly income of the

for a man speaking with a woman with whom he is forbidden 
to speak and Yaj. II. 285 prescribes a fine of one hundred paws 
in the case of a woman who is forbidden to speak with a man 
( by her husband or father &o. ) and a fine of two hundred panas 
in the case of the man who speaks with a woman with whom he 
is forbidden to speak. Brhaspati 1313 says that a wife should

the world of Hari and revels with her husband. The Skanda 
Purana (Brahma-khanda, Dharmaranya section, chap. 7) has a 
long description of a pativrata 'she should not repeat the name 
of her husband, as such conduct leads to the increase of the 
husband's life and should never take the name of another male 
( v. 18 ), even when she is loudly blamed ( by the husband ) 
she does not cry loudly, even when beaten she is smiling (v. 19). 
A pativrata should always use turmeric, kunkuma, sindura, 
lamp black ( for the eye ), a bodice, tambula, auspicious orna- 
ments, and should braid her hair ' ( vv. 28-29). The Padma-purana 
(Srsti-khanda.chap. 47, v. 55) says that that wife is pativrata who 
in doing work is like a slave, like a hetaira in affording sexual 
pleasure, like a mother in offering food and like a counsellor 
in adversity. * 

Special rules of conduct were laid down for a wife whose 
husband was away from home on a journey. Sankha-Likhita 
( quoted by Apararka p. 108, Sm. C, vyavahara p. 253) contain a 
long statement about what such a wife should not do ' women 
whose husbands are away from home should avoid amusements 
of swing and dance, seeing pictures, applying unguents to the 
body, walking in parks, sleeping in open places (or uncovered).

partaking of sumptuous food and drink, playing with a ball, 
fragrant resins and perfumes, flowers, ornaments, ceremonial 
brushing of the teeth, collyrium ( in the eyes ). ' Yaj. (I. Si) 
puts theee briefly ' a woman whose husband is gone to another 
country should give up play, the adornment of the body, 
visiting samajas (note 986 above) and festivals, laughing, going 
to the house of a stranger. ' The Anusasana-parva 1315 ( 123. 17 ) 
indicates that a wife whose husband is gone abroad does not 
apply eyesalve or rocana ( yellow pigment ) to her body, does 
not take a ceremonial bath and does not use flowers, unguents 
or ornaments. Manu ( IX. 74-75 ) requires the husband when 
going abroad to make provision for the wife's maintenance, since 
a woman without some means of livelihood, though originally 
virtuous, may go astray and adds ' when the husband goes 
abroad after providing for maintenance, the wife should live 
thereby and abide by the restrictions ( laid down for such 
wives); if he goes away without making provision for her 
maintenance she should maintain herself by crafts ( such as 
spinning ) which are unblamable. " The Visnu Dh. S. (25. 9-10) 
contains similar rules. The Veda-Vyasa-smrti ( II. 52 ) enjoins 
upon a wife whose husband is gone abroad 4 her 1318 face should 
look pale and distressed, she should not embellish her body, 
she should be devoted to her husband, should be without ( full ) 
meal, and should emaciate her body.' The Trikandamandana ,m 
( I. 80-81 and 85 ) says that when the husband is gone abroad 
the wife may with the help of a priest perform the daily duties 
of agnihotra> the obligatory istis and pitryajiia, but should not 
perform soma sacrifices. 

The rewards of the wife's single-minded devotion to her 
husband and her rigid observance of the rules of conduct 
prescribed for her are stated at great length in smrti works. 
Manu ( IX. 29-30 = Manu V. 165 and 164 ) says ' that woman 
who does not prove faithless to her husband in thought, word 
and deed ( lit. body ) secures the ( heavenly ) worlds together 
with her husband and is spoken of as a sadhvi ' ( a virtuous 
woman, a pativraia ) ; but by proving faithless to her husband a

woman incurs censure in this world, is born as a female jackal 
( in the next life ) and is afflicted with very bad diseases. ' 
Yaj. ( I. 75 and 87 ) declares that the woman, who does not 
approach another while the husband is living or after his death 
and who is intent on doing what is agreeable and beneficial 
to her husband, who is of good conduct and has restrained her 
senses, attains glory in this world and plays with Uraa (the 
wife of Siva) in heaven. Brhaspati 1318 defines a pativrata as 
one who is distressed when her husband is distressed, who is 
delighted when her husband is in delight, who is emaciated 
and wears dirty clothes when her husband has gone on a 
journey and who dies on the death of her husband. 

In the Mahabhaiata and the puranas hyperbolical des- 
criptions of the power of the pativrata occur at every step. Vide 
Vana-parva 63 where we are told ( vv. 38-39) that when 
DamayantI cursed by her faithfulness to her husband the young 
hunter who had evil designs on her, he fell down a dead man. 
In the Anusasanaparva 123 Sandill who 1319 had attained heavenly 
worlds tells Sumana Kaikeyl how she reached that state with- 
out wearing kasayas ( dyed garments worn by samnyasins ) or 
bark garments and without having matted hair or without 
tonsuring her head ( as ascetics do ), but by strictly following 
the rules laid down for virtuous wives, such as not addressing 
harsh words to their husband, abandoning all food that the 
husband did not like, Anusasaua ( 146. 4-6 ) names several 
pativratus of ancient times and the following verses dilate 
upon the rules of conduct for virtuous wives. The story of 
Savitrl in the Vanaparva ( 293-299 ) illustrates the power of a 
pativrata, who wrung back even from Yama, the dread god of 
Death, the life of her husband. mo Savitrl and Slta have been , 
held by the women of India for thousands of years as the

highest ideals of womanly virtue, to which they have always 
endeavoured to approach and one may say that Indian women 
generally have most successfully lived up to that high and 
ennobling ideal that was set before them. Vanaparva (205-206) 
tells the story of a learned brahmana, who by his mere angry 
look made a female crane die when the latter voided its faeces 
on to the head of the brahmana and who was rebuked by a 
pativrata that the latter was not a crane, when the brahmana 
tried to frighten the virtuous woman for her tardiness in 
welcoming him as a guest and for looking only after her husband. 
The Salyaparva ( 63 ) narrates how awful the power of a pati- 
vrata like Gandharl is in that she can, if she choose, burn the 
world, she can stop even the motions of the sun and 1881 the 
moon. The Skanda-purana III ( Brahma-khanda, Brahmaranya 
section chap. 7 ) first names ( verses 14-15 ) several pativratas 
like ArundhatI, Anasiiya, Savitrl, Sandilya, Satya, Mena and 
then waxes eloquent over the tremendous spiritual power of a 
pativrata ' just as a snake-charmer 1288 forcibly draws out from 
a hole a snake, so a pativrata snatches away her husband's life 
from the messengers of Death and reaches heaven with her 
husband and the messengers of Death, on seeing the pativrata, 
beat a hasty retreat. ' 

As the foremost duty of the wife was to honour and serve 
the husband, she must always stay with him and she had 
a right of residence in the house. A wife was further entitled 
to be maintained in the house by the husband. A verse quoted 
by Medhatithi on Manu III. 62 and IV. 251 and by the Mit. on 
Yaj. L 224 and II. 175 and which occurs in some MSS. as 
a spurious verse after Manu XI. 10 says ' Manu declares that 
one must maintain one's aged parents, a virtuous wife and 
a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts'. 1883 Daksa

II. 36 ( = Laghu-Asvalayana im I. 74 ) defines posyavarga 
( persons whom every one, however poor, is bound to maintain ) 
as follows : ' the parents, the guru, the wife, children and a 
helpless man who has taken shelter with one, a guest and fire 
constitute posyavarga.' Manu VIII. 389 prescribes that the 
man who abandons and does not maintain his parents, wife, and 
son, when they are not outcasted, should be fined 600 panas 
by the king. Yaj. I. 74 requires the husband to maintain a wife 
whom he has superseded in the same way as before, otherwise 
he would be guilty of great sin. Yaj. I. 76 says that if a man 
abandoned a wife who was obedient, diligent, the mother of a son, 
and agreeable in speech, he was to be made to give one-third 
of his property to the wife, but if he had no property he had to 
maintain her. Narada ( strlpurhsa 95 ) has a similar provision. 
The Visnu Dh. S. V. 163 made the husband punishable like 
a thief, if he abandoned his wife. The husband was required 
by Yaj. I. 81 to be devoted to his wife, since women are to be 
guarded ( against falling into error ). Vide Yaj. I. 78 also. 
Manu IV. 133 forbids adultery with another's wife and Manu 
IV. 134 ( = AnuÂ§asanal04. 21 and Markandeya-purfina 34. 62-63) 
observes that there is nothing that harms one's life as much as 
adultery. Vtevarupa ms on Yaj. 1. 80 points out that the guarding 
of a wife from evil can be secured only by being devoted to 
her and not by beating her, as, if the husband were to beat her, 
it might endanger her life. Manu (IX. 5-9) also calls upon men 
to guard women, and ( in IX. 10-12 ) says that they cannot be 
guarded by imprisonment or force, but by engaging them in 
looking to the income and expenditure, the furniture, beauty 
and purity of the house and' the cooking and by inculcating on 
them the value of a virtuous life. In spite of this the husband 
possessed certain powers of physical correction over the wife 
which were the same as those possessed by a teacher over 
a pupil or a father over a son, viz, he could administer beating 
with a rope or a thin piece of bamboo on the back but never on 
the head. Vide Manu VIII. 299-300 ( cited above on p. 363 ) 
which are the same as Matsyapurana 227. 152-154. It will 
be seen that about two thousand years ago Manu did not confer

greater powers of correction and restraint of the wife on the 
husband than the Common Law of England allowed to husbands 
even in the 18th century. 1326 

As it was the husband's duty to provide residence and 
maintenance for the wife and as the wife was bound to stay 
with the husband, it follows that either party could after marriage 
enforce his or her rights in a court of law if the other party 
refused to perform her or his duties. In modern times a suit 
for restitution of conjugal rights can be brought and the decree 
can be executed against the wife by the attachment and sale of 
her property ( if she has any ), but not by detention in civil jail 
and against the husband by the court ordering the husband to 
make periodical payments of money for the maintenance of the 
wife and securing such payments by creating a charge on his 
property (vide Civil Procedure Code of 1908 Order 21 rules 
32 and 33 ). To such a suit by the husband Indian Courts have 
recognised certain valid defences, such as desertion, cruelty or 
such conduct as endangers the health of the wife, change of 
religion, or keeping a concubine in the house or the husband's 
being afflicted with a loathsome disease ( like leprosy ). Vide 
Bat Premkunvar v. Bhika 5 Bom. H. C. R, ( A. C. J. ) p. 209 
( leprosy ), Yamunabai v. Narayan 1 Bom. 164 ( cruelty ), Paigi 
v. Sheo Narain 8 All, 78, Didar Koer v. Dwarkanath 34 Cal. 971, 
Bat Jivi v. Narsingh 51 Bora. 329. Where the courts make the 
husband pay maintenance, they are in principle following Yaj. 
I. 76 and Narada ( p. 569 ). Vide Binda v. Kaunsilia 13 All. 
126 where many original Sanskrit texts are oited. 

Not only was the husband bound to maintain the wife, but 
he was called upon to cohabit with the wife and was supposed 
to incur the sin of embryo-murder if he refused without good 
cause to do so. On the other hand the husband had a right of

(ed. of 1765, Oxford) Book I. chap. 15 pp. 432-433 'The husband also 

( by the old law ) might give his wife moderate correction the law 

thought it reasonable to entrust him with this power of restraining her 
by domestic chastisement in the same moderation that a man is allowed 

to correct his servants or children Yet the lower rank of people 

still claim and exert their ancient privilege ; and the courts of law will 
still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any 
gross behaviour*. Vide also Lush on the law of * Husband and Wife ' 
(4th ed. 1933) pp. 24-29 about the husband's power to beat his wife and 
restrain her in the past and now.

consortium i. e. the wife was not to refuse herself to the husband 
and if she did so her delinquency was to be proclaimed in the 
village and she was to be driven from the house im . 

The humane character of the legislation of the Indian 
sages is seen by the fact that even for adultery they do not 
allow the husband to drive the wife out of the house and to 
abandon her. Gaut. 22. 35 prescribes that a wife who violates 
her duty of chastity must undergo a penance, but she should be 
kept under guard and be given food. Yaj. ( I. 70, 72 ) declares 
' an adulterous woman should be deprived of her authority ( over 
servants &c. ), should be made to wear dirty clothes, should be 
given food just sufficient to enable her to live, should be treated 
with scorn and made to lie on the ground (not on a cot); a 
woman becomes pure from adultery when she has her monthly 
period after that, but if she conceives in adulterous intercourse 
she may be abandoned and also when she is guilty of the 
murder of her foetus or of her husband or of some sin that 
makes her an outcast \ The Mit. on Yaj. I. 72 draws attention 
to the text of Vasistha XXL 12 'the wives of brahmanas, 12 * 8 
ksatriyas and vaisyas who commit adultery with a sudra may 
be purified by a penance in case no child is born (of the inter- 
course), but not otherwise' and remarks that the words of 
Yajnavalkya are to be understood in the same sense i. e. a wife 
is to be abandoned only if she be in adultery with a 6udra; and 
further that the abandonment consists in not allowing her to 
participate in religious rites and conjugal matters, but she is not 
to be cast on the streets ; she is to be kept apart guarded in 
a room and to be given food and raiment ( as stated in Yaj. III. 
297). Vasistha XXL 10 says that only four (types of) wives 
are to be abandoned viz. one who has intercourse with the 
husband's pupil and with the husband's guru, and especially 
one who attempts to kill her husband and who commits

adultery with a man of degraded caste ( like a leather- worker )â¦ 
Narada m9 ( strlpumsa v. 91 ) says ' when a woman commits adul- 
tery her hair shall be shaven, she shall have to lie on a low bed, 
shall receive bad food and clothing and her occupation will be 
the removal of sweepings of the husband's house \ Gaut. 23. 14, 
&anti-parva 165. 64 and Manu VIII. 371 are more harsh on a 
woman who has intercourse with a low-caste man, i. e, she 
is to be punished by the king with being devoured by dogs. 
Veda-Vyasa ( II. 49-50 ) says that * a wife 1380 who is guilty 
of adultery should be kept in the house but void of her 
rights of associating in religious and conjugal matters and of 
her rights over property, and should be treated with scorn ; but 
when she has had monthly course after the act of adultery ( and 
does not repeat it ), the husband should allow her the usual 
rights of a wife as before. ' Manu XL 177 asks the husband 
to confine an exceedingly corrupt wife to one room and compel 
her to perform the penance 1831 prescribed for males in cases of 
adultery. Vide Atri V. 1-5, ParSsiara IV. 20 and XL 87 and 
Brhad-Yama IV. 36. 

Under the English law, if the wife commits adultery 
the husband's obligation to maintain her ceases altogether un- 
less he had connived at it or condoned it. l3SB 

The following propositions can be deduced from the texts 
cited above. (1) There is no absolute right of abandonment 
of wife in the husband on the ground of adultery ; (2) Adultery 
is ordinarily an upapataka ( a minor sin ) and can be atoned 
for by appropriate penance undergone by the wife ; (3) the wife 
who has committed adultery but has undergone penance is to 
be restored to all the ordinary rights of wives ( vide Vas. 
XXI. 12, Yaj. I. 72, Mit. thereon and Apararka p. 98 ) ; (4) as 
long as the adulteress has not undergone penance, she is to be 
given in the house itself starving maintenance and to be depriv- 
ed of all her rights as wife ( Yaj. I. 70, Santiparva 165. 63 ) ;

(5) a wife, who commits adultery with a sudra or has had a 
child thereby, who is guilty of killing her foetus or of attempt 
to kill the husband or guilty of one of the deadly sins ( maha- 
patakas ), is to be deprived of her right to participation in 
religious rites or conjugal matters and is to be kept confined 
in a room or in a hut near the house and to be given starving 
maintenance and poor apparel, even after she undergoes 
penance ( Vas. XXL 10, Manu XL 177, Yaj. III. 297-98 and 
Mit. thereon); (6) that wives who are not guilty of acts men- 
tioned in Yaj. I. 72, III. 297-298, Vas. 21. 10 or 28. 7 are to be 
given starving maintenance and residence near the house even 
if they do not perform penance ( vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 298 ) ; 
(7) wives who are guilty of the acts mentioned in Yaj. I. 72, 
III. 297-298, if they refuse to perform penance, are to be 
refused even starving maintenance and residence near the 
husband's house (Mit. on Yaj. III. 298). The propositions 
about maintenance set out here are accepted as the modern 
Hindu Law by the courts in India. 1233 

It has been shown above (p. 518) that Ap. postulated the 
identity of husband and wife in religious matters and Manu 
IX. 45 declares that the husband is one with his wife. But this 
identity of husband and wife was not accepted by the ancient 
sages for secular or legal purposes. The rights of husband and 
wife as to each other's property and the liability of each for the 
debts of the other will be dealt with later on in detail. It may 
suffice here to point out that the wife was not ordinarily liable 
for the debts contracted by the husband nor was the husband 
liable for the debts contracted by the wife alone, unless the 
debt was for family purposes (Yaj. II. 46). Similarly the 
husband could exercise no dominion over the wife's own 
property ( her strldhana or peculium ) except in a famine or for 
a necessary religious purpose, or in disease or when he was 
imprisoned ( Yaj. II. 147 ). These rules prescribed centuries 
ago compare in their fairness or reasonableness most favourably 
with the rules of the English law 1334 ( as they prevailed before 
the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, 45 and 46 Vict, 
chap. 75 ), whereby the husband by the mere fact of marriage 
acquired free-hold interest, during the joint lives of himself and

his wife, in all estates of inheritance and life estates of which 
she was seised at the marriage or became seised during 
coverture, and an absolute interest in all the wife's personal 
chattels. 

Narada im ( strlpumsa, v. 89 ) does not allow the husband 
or wife to lodge a complaint against one another with their 
relations or with the king. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 294 remarks 
4 though a judicial proceeding between husband and wife as 
plaintiff and defendant before the king is forbidden, still, if the 
king comes to know personally or indirectly of wrong done by 
the one to the other, the king must bring round the husband or 
the wife to the path of duty by appropriate punishment, other- 
wise 13Je the king incurs sin \ There were certain matters of 
which the king could take cognisance without the complaint 
of anybody : they were called aparadhas ( they are ten ) among 
which were inoluded the murder of a woman, varnasarhkara, 
adultery, pregnancy of a widow from some person other than 
the husband, abortion 1337 &c. We have seen (p. 569) that Yaj. 1. 76, 
Narada ( strlpumsa, v. 95 ) make the husband liable to pay 
one-third of his estate or a fine for deserting a virtuous wife 
and there are many such provisions about the matters affecting 
the husband and wife in which the king interfered. In 
England 1838 at Common Law a wife could not sue her husband 
in tort ( till the Married Women's Property Act ) nor could a 
husband sue the wife in tort. 




We must now turn to the position of women in general 
and wives in particular and the estimate of their character and 
worth made by ancient India. It has already been seen (p. 428) 
how the wife was looked upon as half of the husband, how in 
Vedic times women composed hymns and learnt the Vedas and 
how they co-operated with their husbands in all religious acts. 
On the whole their social position was much better ( except as to 
rights of property ) than what it became in later times. But

Oh. XI ] Position of women 575 

even in the Vedio times there was an under-current of 
opinion which was hostile to women, sneered at them and treated 
them with scorn. Some oTthe-passages ffomTedtc i and classical 
Sanskrit literature eulogising women and the wife have been 
set out above (pp. 428ff ). The passages noted below may be read 
in this connection. 1889 Vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 63-64, Manu III. 
55-62, Yaj. I. 71, 74, 78, 82, Vas. Dh. S. 28. 1-9, Atri vv. 140- 
141 and 193-198, Adiparva 74. 140-152, Santiparva 144. 6 and 
12-17, AnuSasana 46, MSrkandeyapurana 21. 69-76. The 
Kamasutra III. 2 says that women^aTe^i feetT6Wers '( kusuma- 
sadharmano hi yositah ). It has been seen (ppTHlf-TJ?) how way 
was to be made by all for the TmcTe and the pregnant woman and 
it will be sliown thatthegeneral opinion "WHsifaat no woman was 
to be killed on any account ( with one or two exceptions 1340 in 
ancient writers,). Some of the srartikaras like Atri and Devala 
were so liberal as tosaytHat women who had intercourse with one 
not of the same caste" or who had conceived by ~such intercourse 
did not become outcasts, but only impure till delivery or next 
period when they became pure again and could be associated 
with, the child born of the adulterous connection being handed 
over to some one else for being brought up. 1241 If a woman was 
raped she was not to be abandoned, but she became impure only 
till her next period TAtri 197-198 ) and Devala ( 48-49 ) pres- 
cribes purifications for a woman raped by mleccJias and concei- 
ving thereby. In the Santiparva 267. 38 it is said that it is not 
the woman who fs at Fault, but" it is the man who is at fault 
( when the woman goes astray ). In the Varunapraghasa 1242

( one of the caturmasyas ) the sacrificed wife had to confess if 
she had a lover and even when slie colTFesselhsfce-was allowed to 
co-operate with her husband in the sacrifice. Vide Tai. Br. 
I. 6. 5, Sat. Br. II. 5. 2. 20, Katyayana Sr. V. 5. 6-10. 

As against the high eulogy and considerate treatment of 
women a few passages unfavourable to women may be cited. We 
have already seen (p. 503) how woman was saidltTbe"' falsehood ' 
incarnate (Maitrayanlya S. 1. 10. 11 ). Rg. VIII. 33. 17 says * the 
mind of woman is uncontrollable'; Rg, X. 95. 15 and Satapatha 
XL 5. 1. 9 declare ' there is no friendship with women and 
they have the hearts of hyaenas ' (addressed to Pururavas about 
Urvasl); Rg. V. 30. 9 * women are the weapons and army of the 
dasa\ The Tai. S. VL 5. 8. 2 m * says 'therefore women are 
without strength, take no daya (portion) and speak more weakly 
than even a wretched man \ This passage ( which really refers 
to women not being entitled to a portion of Soma drink) is 
relied upon by Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 53 ) and ,244 by Manu IX. 18 
for prescribing the entire dependence of women on men, for 
depriving them of a share on partition or inheritance and of 
the privilege of Vedic mantras. The $at. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 44. 
p. 446 ) says that woman, sudra, a dog and a crow embody un- 
truth, sin and darkness (XIV. 1. 1. 31). The same Brahmana 
( IV. 4. 2. 13, S. B. E. vol. 26, p. 366 ) remarks * the wives 
being smitten ( with ghee-the thunderbolt ) and unmanned 
neither rule over themselves nor over daya ( share of pro- 
perty )' ,S4S . Another passage of the Satapatha ( S. B. E. vol. 44, 
p. 300) says ' He thereby makes women to be dependent, whence 
women are sure to be attendant upon man* (XIII. 2. 2. 4). ( These 
passages establish that even in Vedic times women were often 
looked down upon, had no share in property and were dependent. 
The passages about the character of women contain no more than 
what male cynics^afid critics of all times and in all countries 
have attributed to women such as"* frailty, thy name is woman ! \

worse and worse as time went on, except as to rights j>f

and IX. 2-3, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 50-52, Narada ( dayabhaga 31)- 
all declare 1346 that women are not independent, but dependent 
in all matters on men and that in childhood, after marriage and 
in old age they are to be guarded by the father, the husband and 
the son respectively. Manu ( IX. 2-3 ) refers to raksa ( i. e. 
protection againsb harm or calamity ), while Manu V. 146-148 
declare a woman's dependence even in all domestic matters 
at all stages of her life on some male. Narada ( dayabhaga 
vv. 28-30 ) adds 1S47 ' when a widow is sonless, her husband's 
relatives are the controlling authority as regards her main- 
tenance, the application ( of the husband's property ) and 
guarding her against harm; if there be no relative or sapin^as of 
the husband, then a woman's father's family has control of her ; 
the oreator assigned dependence to women as women even of 
good family fall into ruin by independence '. It has been seen 
above (pp. 561-562) that a woman's only concern was to serve her 
husband, and that she could perform other observances or under- 
take fasts and pilgrimages only with her husband's permission.

untruth ' ( Anusasana 19. 6 ) ; ' there is nothing more wicked 
than women, who are the edge of a razor, poison, snake 
and fire in one ' ( Anusasana 38. 12 and 29 ) ; there may be 
at most one pativrata in hundreds of thousands of women ' 
( Anusasana 19. 93 ) ; ' women are really uncontrollable but 
remain within bounds as regards their husbands simply because 
other men do not woo them and because they are afraid 
of servants' (Anu&ftsana 38. 16 ); vide also Anusasana chap. 38. 
24-25, chap. 39. 6-7 (women have the tricks of the demons 
Sambara, Namuci and others ). The RamSyana is not behind 
the Great Epic in condemning women * This is the character 
of women seen in the three worlds viz. they are renegades from 
Dharma, fickle, cruel and oreate estrangement * ( Aranya- 
kanda 1350 45. 29-30). In an uncharitable mood Manu (IX. 14-15) 
gives to women the following character 4 they are lascivious, 
fickle-minded, devoid of love and come to dislike their husbands 
and resort to another man, whether handsome or ugly, simply 
because he is a man. ' * It is the nature of women to tempt 
men; therefore the wise do not act heedlessly with young 
women, who are able to lead a man astray whether he be 
learned or not* (Manu II. 213-214 = Anusasana 48. 37-38). 
Brhat-Para&ara 1351 ( JivSnanda's Collection, part 2, p. 121 ) says 
that the passion of women is eightfold of that of men. In 
modern times old men, though they might not know much of 
the sastras, are often in the habit of repeating a verse which 
contains a list of the faults of women ' falsehood, thoughtless 
action, trickery, folly, great greed, impurity, cruelty â these are 
the natural faults of women. ,135a

Ch. XI ] Defence of Women 579 

protested against the injustice of these accusationSj^JVamhas. 
raihira ( 6th century A. D. ) in his Brhat-Samhita chap. 74 ( ed. 
by Kern ) makes a spirited defence of women and eulogises 
them highly. He first; says that on women depend dharma and 
ariKa and from them man derives the pleasures of sense and 
the blessing of sons, that they are the LaksmI ( goddess of 
Prosperity ) of the house and should be always given 
honour and wealth. He then condemns those who following 
the path of asceticism and other-worldliness proclaim the 
demerits of women and are silent about their virtues and 
pertinently asks nn * tell me truly, what faults attributed to 
women have not been also practised by men ? Men in their 
audacity treat women with contempt, but they really possess 
more virtues ( than men ).' He then cites the dicta of Manu in 
support (verses 7-10). "One's mother or one's wife is a 
woman ; men owe their birth to women ; O ungrateful wretches, 
how can happiness be your lot when you condemn them ? The 
sastras declare that both husband and wife are equally sinful 
if they prove faithless to the marriage vow ; men care very 
little for that sastra ( while women do care ) ; therefore women 
are superior to men. Oh I how great is the audacity of wicked 
men who heap abuse on women that are pure and blameless, 
like robbers who while themselves stealing raise a hue and cry 
* stop, O thief !. ' Man in privacy utters words of cajolry to 
woman, but there are no such words after the woman dies ; 
while women, in gratitude, clasp the corpses of their husbands 
and enter the fire. " It may be said that, barring great poets 
like Kalidasa, 1254 Bana and Bhavabhuti, in the classical period

$80 History of Dliarmaiaslra I Ch. XI 

Varahamihira's was rather a solitary voice raised in defence, of 
women and in the appreciation of their worth. 

In the midst of this dark picture and undeserved condem- 
nation of woman there is one very bright spot, viz. the high 
eulogy of and the reverence for the mother in all smrti works. 
Gaut. (II. 56) first says that the acarya (one's teacher of the Veda) 
is the highest among gurus, while some teachers hold that the 
mother is the highest. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 10. 28. 9 prescribes 
that a son must always serve his mother even if she has been 
an outcast ( for some great sin ), since the mother undertakes for 
her son numerous ( troublesome ) actions. Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 
48 ) requires the son to maintain his mother, even though an 
outcast, without speaking to her. Vas. Db. S. 13. 47 says ' a 
father who is an outcast may be abandoned, but a mother 
( though patita ) is never an outcast to the son. ,1255 * The ac&rya 
exceeds by his greatness ten upadhyayas, the father exceeds a 
hundred acaryas, a mother exceeds a thousand fathers' says Manu 
II. 145 ( = Vas. Dh. S. 13.48 ). Sankha-Likhita 1256 give a very 
salutary piece of advice ' the son should not take sides ( in a 
quarrel ) between his father and mother : indeed he may ( if he 
chooses ) speak on the side of the mother alone, since the 
mother bore him ( in her womb ) and nourished him ; the son, 
while living, would never be free from the debt he owes to his 
mother except by the performance of the Sautramani sacrifice. * 
Yaj. I. 35 holds that the mother is superior to the guru, acarya 
and upadhyaya. The Anusasana parva 1357 ( 105. 14-16 ) says 
that ' the mother excels in her greatness ten fathers or even the 
whole earth ; there is no guru like the mother. ' Santiparva 
chap. 267 contains a very high eulogy of the mother. Atri 151 
says that there is no guru higher than the mother. The great

Ch. XI ] Estimate about Women 581 

Pandava heroes pay the highest honour to their mother KuntL 
The Adiparva chap. 37 says that one may avert the conse- 
quences of all curses, but a mother's curse can never be 
averted 1258 . 

Reading all that has been said in favour of and against 
women in ancient Sanskrit Literature it may be said that the 
higher minds of Hindu Society were quite aware of the worth 
of women, that they insisted on chastity as the highest virtue 
for them, that there was no doubt an undercurrent among 
common people of poor opinion about women, that those 
who valued an ascetic life and wanted to wean people 
away from worldly ties and attachments looked down upon 
women ( ' vairagyamargena ' as Varahamihira happily puts 
it) and exaggerated their faults. It has to be borne in 
mind that many of the passages condemning women are put 
in the mouth of persons who were for some reason or other 
angry with women or wronged by them or dissatisfied with 
their conduct. Further in assessing passages disparaging the 
character of women one maxim of the Purvamlmarhsa system 
must not be lost sight of. The maxim is stated by Sabara ( on 
Jairaini II. 4. 21 ) as follows : 1359 ' the purpose of a text censur- 
ing anything is not censure pure and simple, but the purpose is 
to enjoin the performance of the opposite of what is censured and 
to praise such performance *. The object therefore of the authors 
that censured women was to inculcate the great value of chastity 
and obedience for women and not merely to paint a dark 
picture of them. 

^he rights of woman as jregards partition and inheritance 
will be discussed in detail later on. But a brief statement about 
them may be made here. Ap., Manu, and Narada do not 
allow the widow of a sonless male to succeed as heir, while 
Gaut. 28. 19 appears to contemplate that she is an heir along 
with mpir^as or sagotras. That the widow's right to succeed 
as heir to her deceased husband was not recognised in ancient

times is clear from the S&kuntala ( Act VI ) where the minister 
writes to the king that the estate of a merchant dying at sea 
will esoheat to the crown and will not go to his widow. Yaj, 
II. 135. mentions the widow as the first heir of a sonless man 
dying separate ; Visnu, Katyayana and others say the same. 
So in medieval times the rights of widows to property were 
better recognized than in the times of the early sutra writers. 
In this respect the position of women improved in medieval 
times, though in the religious and other spheres their position 
became worse, as they were equated with sudras. Yaska while 
explaining Rg. I. 124. 7 states that in the southern countries 
the widow of a sonless man goes to an assembly hall, stands 
upon a stool and when the members strike her with dice she 
gets the property of her deceased 1360 husband. This implies that 
in Nothern India widows did not succeed to their husband's 
property in Yaska's time.

CHAPTER XII 

THE DUTIES OF A WIDOW, SOME PRIVILEGES 
OF WOMEN AND THE PURDA SYSTEM 

Vidhavadharmah 

; So far the social position and the duties and rights of a 
wife during her husband's life-time have been considered. We 
shall now consider the rules laid down for a wife if she has 
the heavy misfortune to become a widow. 13jl 

The word vidhava occurs several times in the Rgveda (e. g. 
IV. 18. 12, X. 18. 7, X. 40. 2 and 8 ); but these passages contain 
very little that is indicative of their condition in society except 
Rg. X. 40. 2 (vide under niyoga). Rg. I. 87. 3 l36 * says 4 in the 
rapid movements of the Maruts the earth trembles like a woman 
deprived of her husband/ That shows that widows trembled either 
from sorrow or from fear of molestation and ill-treatment. 

The Baud. Dh. S. ]m II. 2. 66-68 prescribes that the widow 
of the departed should give up for one year honey, meat, wine 
and salt and should sleep on the ground ; according to Maud- 
galya (she should so act) for six months; after that period, 
if she is sonless, she may procreate a son from her brother- 
in-law if the elders consent.' Vas. Dh. S. ( 17. 55-56 ) contains 
similar provisions. Manu ( V. 157-160 ) contains rules that 
have been repeated in almost all smrtis 'a woman when her 
husband is dead, may, Â»if she chooses, emaciate her body by 
subsisting on flowers, roots and fruits, but she should not even 
take the name of a stranger male. Till her death she should be 
forbearing, observe vows, should be celibate and should hanker 
after that super-eminent code of conduct that is prescribed 
for women devoted to their husbands. On her husband's death, 
if a virtuous woman abides by the rule of celibacy, she goes 
to heaven though she be sonless, as the ancient perpetual

students ( like Sanaka ) did \ Katyayana ,S64 similarly provides 
* a sonless widow preserving the bed of her husband ( unsullied ) 
and residing with her elders and being self-controlled ( or 
forbearing ) should enjoy her husband's property till her death ; 
after her the heirs of her husband would get it. A widow 
engrossed in religious observances and fasts, abiding by the 
vow of celibacy, always bent on restraining her senses and 
making gifts would go to heaven even though sonless.' Parasara 
IV. 31 is almost the same as Manu V. 160. B^haspati 1365 says 
' the wife is declared to be half of a man's body, she participates 
equally in the husband's merit and sin ; a virtuous wife* 
whether she burns herself on her husband's funeral fire or lives 
after him, tends to the (spiritual) benefit of her husband'. 
Vrddha-Harlta ( XL 205-210 ) prescribes what a widow should 
do all her life. ' She should give up adorning her hair, chewing 
betel-nut, wearing perfumes, flowers, ornaments and dyed 
clothes, taking food from a vessel of bronze, taking two meals 
a day, applying collyrium to her eyes ; she should wear a white 
garment, should curb her senses and anger, she should not 
resort to deceits and tricks, should be free from laziness and 
sleep, should be pure and of good conduct, should always 
worship Hari, should sleep on the ground at night on a mat of 
kusa grass, she should be intent on concentration of mind and 
on the company of the good.' Bana in his Harsacarita ( VI, last 
para) indicates that widows did not apply eye-salve to their 
eyes nor rocana ( yellow pigment ) to their face and simply 
tied their hair. 1366 Pracetas 1367 forbids to an ascetic and a 
widow the chewing of betel leaves, ceremonial bath ( with oil 
&c. ) and taking meal in a vessel of bell-metal. The Adiparva 
( 160. 12 ) says ' just as birds flock to a piece of flesh left on 
the ground, so all men woo ( or try to seduce ) a woman whose

husband is dead'; while the Santiparva (148. 2) remark* 
' all widows are in sorrow even if they have many sons, ' l26 
The Skandapurana (Kaslkhanda, chap. 4, vv. 71-106 and III 
Brahmaranya section ohap. 7, vv. 67-81) has long passages 
on the duties of widows, many verses from which are quoted in 
the Madanaparijaka (pp. 202-203), the Nirnayasindhu, Dharma- 
sindhu and other nlbandhas. A few striking verses may be 
translated here. The Skandapurana ( III, Brahmaranya section 
chap. 7, verses 50-51) says * The widow is more inauspicious 
than all other inauspicious things; at the sight of a widow 
no success can be had in any undertaking ; excepting one's 
( widowed ) mother all widows are void of auspicicusness ; 
a wise man should avoid even their blessings like the poison 
of a snake' 12<59 . The Kaslkhanda of the same purana, chap. 4, 
delivers itself thus * the tying up into a braid of the hair by 
the widow leads to the bondage of the husband ; therefore a 
widow should always shave her head. She should always take 
one meal a day and never a second ; or she may perform the 
observance of fast for a month or undergo the penance of candra- 
yana. A widow who sleeps on a cot would make her husband 
fall ( in hell ). A widow should never wash her body with 
fragrant unguents nor should enjoy the fragrance of sweet 
smelling things; she should everyday perform tarpana with 
sesame, water and kusa grass for her husband, his father 
and grandfather after repeating their names and gotra; she 
should not sit in a bullock cart even when about to die, 
she f-hould not put on a bodice, should not wear dyed garments 
and should observe special vows in Vaisakha, Kartika l27 Â° 
and Magha.' The verse ' vidhava-kabarl-bandho <&c ' ( Skanda,

586 History of Dharmaiasira [ Ch. XII 

KaÂ£lkhanda 4.74) is the only verse on which the medieval 
writers rely for prescribing continual tonsure of widows. That 
chapter begins by extolling the pativrata (Brhaspati does it with 
regard to LopSmudra, the wife of Agastya). It passes one's under- 
standing why when a pativrata whose husband is living is before 
Brhaspati he should wax eloquent over the duties of widows 
( verses 71-106 ). Therefore this portion appears to be an 
interpolation in the Skandapurana itself. In Lakshmibai v. 
Ramchandra I. Lr. R. 22 Bom. 590, it was held that the text 
* vidhava-kabarl-bandho y is of doubtful validity ( p. 594 ). 
Besides 69 verses of this chapter 4 are common to chap. 7 
of the Dharmaranya section of the Skandapurana ( III ) which 
precedes it. There is no reason why they should have been 
repeated. The Nirnayasindhu quotes a passage from the 
Brahmapurana as cited in the Prthvlcandrodaya to the effect 
that sraddha food should not be got prepared by a widow 
belonging to another gotra. 1371 

-' The position of the Hindu widow was miserable and her 
lot" was most unenviable. She^ was looked upon as inauspicious 
and so could take part in no festivities, such as those on 
marriage. She had not only to lead a life of perfect celibacy, 
even if she was a child widow, but she had to act like an 
ascetic, being poorly fed ( only once a day ) and poorly clad. 
Her rights to property were negligible. Even if the husband 
died sonless she did not originally succeed as shown above 
(p. 582). Later on her position as an heir was improved; but even 
then she could ordinarily enjoy only the income of the pro- 
perty and could transfer it only for the legal necessities of the 
family ( including herself ) or for the spiritual benefit of her 
husband. In a joint Hindu family a widow had only the right 
of maintenance ( except in Bengal where she had more rights ), 
which would be forfeited if bhe became unchaste and persisted in 
that course. 1378 If she returned to a moral life then she may be 
entitled to bare starving maintenance ( vide above p. 573 ). 
If her husband had separate property and left a son or sons, the 
widow was only entitled to maintenance. This was the law 
in British India till very recently. Recently the position of the

widow of a member in a joint Hindu family and of the widow 
of a person who leaves separate property has been improved 
by Act XVIII of 1937 as amended by Act XI of 1938. 

One subject that arouses bitter controversies is the practice 
of tonsuring widows among brahmanas and certain other castes. 
A few words must be said on this. It is clear from the verse 
( vidhava-kabarl-bandho &c.) of the Skandapurana quoted in the 
Madanaparijata and other nibandhas that for some time at least 
before the 14th century A. D. (when the Madanaparijata was 
composed ) tonsure of widows was in vogue. How and exactly 
when this practice arose cannot be established with certainty* 
That it is comparatively a later innovation can, however, be 
demonstrated. Two distinct propositions have to be made out, 
first, that widows were tonsured on the death of their husbands, 
just as sons were tonsured and secondly, that widows were 
required by the texts to tonsure themselves continually from 
time to time till their death, though sons who had to tonsure 
themselves on their father's death are not required to do so after- 
wards. The advocates of this practice rely upon three Vedic 
passages, viz. Rg. X. 40. 2, Ap. M. Patha I. 4. 9, and Atharvaveda 
14.2. 60, Rg X. 40. 2 ( cited below p. 606 ) refers to vidhava only 
and probably to niyoga,but there is nothing about tonsure in that 
verse. Some modern orthodox Pandits ingeniously argue from the 
explanation of the word 'vidhava' in the Nirukta (III. 15 vidha- 
vanad-va iti Carmasirah). Carmasiras is the name of a former 
teacher according to all commentators of the Nirukta, but these 
pandits interpret it by a tour deforce as a synonym of vidhava 
('having only the bare skin ott her head'). About this interpretation 
the less said the better. Ap. M. P. 1. 5. 9 contains the word 'vikesl' 
which is translated as the appellation of a female goblin in S. 
B. E. vol. 30 p. 187 ' mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by 
she goblin, the rough haired m * one '. Even taking ' vikesl ' 
as referring to the maiden who is being married the meaning 
is 'mayst thou, with dishevelled hair, not beat thy breast 
(through grief)'. The word 'vikesl' does not mean 'a 
widow whose hair is tonsured ' ; it ordinarily means ' a woman

588 History of Dharmatastra [ Ch. XII 

with dishevelled hair \ The third passage is Atharvaveda im 
14. 2. 60, that is a verse in a marriage hymn which means ' if 
this daughter of thine has bewailed with loosened hair in thy 
house, doing evil by her wailing, from that sin let Agni and 
Savitr release thee'. Here it is impossible to hold that ' vikesl ' 
means tonsured, as this mantra is part of the marriage hymn 
and Agni is asked to remove the blemish due to the girFs 
weeping at the approaching prospect of separation from her 
parents, There is no comment of Sayana on this passage but 
elsewhere in the Atharvaveda when that word occurs as in 
Atharva XL 9. 14 ho paraphrases it by ' viklrnakesl' which does 
not mean 'with tonsured hair' but only 'having dishevelled hair'. 
Therefore there is no reference whatever to the tonsure of 
widows in the Veda, much less an injunction as to it. In the 
Baud. Pitrmedhasutra? 1S75 elaborate rules are laid down about 
the cremation of one who had kindled the sacred Vedic fires. 
In I. 4. 3 it is said ' his wives led by the youngest should 
follow the cortege with dishevelled hair and throwing dust on 
their shoulders ' and this they have to repeat several times ( vide 
I. 4. 12-13, 1. 5, 5-7, 1. 5. 12-14 ) on the way to the cemetery. 
It is also said that they go round ( the corpse ) thrice with 
their hair gathered together ( I. 4. 13). Then in I. 12. 7 shaving 
of the hair and moustache is prescribed for the close relatives 
of the deceased ( amatyas ) who are present, his wives are not 
mentioned in this connection and II. 3. 17 expressly forbids 
tonsure of wives. 

Manu and Yaj. dilate on the duties of widows, but they are 
entirely silent about tonsure. Nor does any other ancient smrti 
refer to it. On the contrary Vrddha-Harlta ( XI. 206 quoted 
above p. 584 ) asks the widow not to deck her hair, among other 
things which she is not to do. This makes it clear that 
the widows kept their hair. The word ' kesaranjanam ' is to 
be dissolved as ' kefcanam ranjanam ' and not as ' kesasca 
raiijanani ca ' (as Vrddha-Harlta XI. 103 makes it clear by 
employing * kesanftm ranjan&rtharh va). It can be shown that

Ch. Xtl ] The tonsure of widows 589 

at least ksatriya widows never tonsured their head. In the 
Mahabharata whenever the widows of the fallen warriors are 
described they are always referred to as * having dishevelled 
hair * and there is not a single reference to tonsure lS76 of 
widows. In the Harsacarita, Harsa 1377 in his soliloquy on 
the death of his father Prabhakaravardhana says * may the 
Glory of super- eminent man-hood tie up her hair in the way in 
which widows tie up their hair \ In the Pehoa prasasti of king 
Mahendrapala of Kanoj (E. I. vol. 1. p. 246 verse 16) the widows 
of his enemies are spoken of as shedding tears on their cheeks 
and having long ( not braided ) and profuse IS78 tresses. 

The orthodox pandits rely on a verse in Vedavyasa-smrti I379 
II. 53 * a brahmana woman should enter fire, clasping the dead 
body of her husband ; if she lives ( does not become satl ) she 
being tyaktakesa should emaciate her body by tapas\ The read- 
ing * br&hmanl * for * jlvantl* is not good, as the word 'brahmani* 
is redundant having occurred in the first half and as the second 
half refers to the fact of her surviving after her husband. In 
this verse the injunction relates only to the emaciation of the 
body ( iosayet ), the word 'tyaktakesa* being only an attribute of 
the subject is no part of the predicate, which alone is enjoined. 
The general rule laid down by the Mlmamsa is (III. 1.13-15, the 
grahaikat vany aya) 1 38 Â° that the attributes of a subject are no part

1380. The grabaikatvanySya is as follows : The text jx% sfarfS 
does not mean that a single sacrificial vessel is to be cleansed, but 
rather that all are to be cleansed. The singular number ( in graham ) is 
an attribute of the subject about which cleansing is predicated and so it 
is no part of the injunction. Vide my notes to the Vyavaha"ra-mayQ"kha 
pp. 83-84,121-122, where examples of the application of this maxim are 
given. The Pandits try to apply the rules in Jaimini III. 3. 34-46, but 
those rules are inapplicable, since in the passage of Veda-Vy5sa there is 
a verb in the potential mood, while in the vodic sentence interpreted in 
Jaimini III. 3. 34-46 there is no verb in the potential mood, 



590 History of Dharmaiastra I Ch. XII 

of the injunction. There is no injunction about Icesa ( hair ) in 
the Vedavyasa passage. Besides the word tyaktakesa ( who has 
given up hair) may possibly be made to yield three meanings, viz. 
(1) one who has given up or is unmindful of dressing or decking 
her hair, (2) one whose hair is given up in accordance with the 
prescription of some smrtis that only two finger-breadths of 
tresses are to be cut off when doing penance for govadha &c. 
in the case of women ( vide Parasara IX. 54-55, Aiigiras 163, 
Yama 54 ) ; ( 3 ) one whose head is tonsured. For the first 
meaning vide Raghuvarhsa IX. 14 ( where ' analakam ' is 
explained by Mallinatha as ' who have given up ornamenting 
the hair * ). For this meaning of c tyakta * vide Bhagavadglta 
I. 33 4 tyaktajlvitah \ 4 Tyakta ' by itself never means tonsured. 
The third meaning will be only implied if at all, while the 
first two are the usual meanings. Further, the interpretation 
of the Veda-VySsa smrti II. 53 given by the pandits is liable 
to the fault called vakyabheda ( i. e. it lays down two 
injunctions in one and the same sentence), as they say 
that Veda-Vyasa calls upon widows to tonsure themselves 
and to emaciate their body. Besides, if Veda-Vyasa really 
meant to enjoin tonsure, the verse could easily have been made 
to read * jlvantl ced vapet kesan tapasS &c. ' Lastly assuming 
that Veda-Vyasa refers to tonsure, there is conflict among smrtis, 
since Vrddha-Harlta ( quoted above ) allows her to keep her hair, 
and since an option results when two texts of equal authority 
conflict ( Gaut. I. 5 ). 1381 

The Mit. on Y5j. III. 325 quotes a text of Manu ( not found 
in the printed Manu ) ' shaving of the hair is not desired in the 
case of learned men, the king and women, except in the case of 
one guilty of mahapataka or the killer of a cow and a brahma- 
carl guilty of sexual intercourse. ' 1382 The Mit. nowhere refers 
to tonsure as one of the obligatory matters for widows. 

The orthodox pandits further rely upon Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 10. 6, 
its explanation in the Mit. on Yaj. III. 17 and the explanation 
of the Mit. in the commentary, Balambhattl. Apastamba's sutra 
is delivered when the context is about cessation of Veda study 
( anadhyaya ). Ap. says ' ( the student ) shall cease studying 
Veda for 12 days if his mother, father or teacher dies. In the

case of the death of these he must also bathe for the same 
number of days. Persons who are younger than ( the relation 
deceased ) must shave their hair. ,383 Some declare that students 
who have returned home on completion of brahmacarya shall 
never shave except when engaged in a 6rauta sacrifice. In 
sattras even the top-lock must be shaved \ In this there is no 
reference to women, much less to widows and lesser still to 
the tonsure of widows. The reference to srauta sacrifices, sattra, 
and -6ikha indicates that only males are in view. The Mit. on Yaj. 
III. 17 explains at length Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 10. 6. It gives two 
senses of ' anubhavin ' viz. those who experience sorrow on the 
death of a person i. e. his sapindas ( from the root ' bhu ' with 
'anu,* to experience) and those who are born after the deceased i. e. 
who are younger than the deceased ( from ' bhu ' with ' anu ' to 
be born after ). The Mit. then combines 1384 these and remarks 
* those sapindas of the deceased who are younger than the latter 
have to shave themselves on the death of a relative'. This is its 
own view. It then refers to the view of some that ' anubhavin * 
in Ap. means ' son * and those latter rely on a restrictive text 
'shaving is declared on seven occasions only, viz. on the 
Ganges, in the Bhaskara-ksetra, on the death of one's parents or 
teacher, at the time of consecrating Srauta fires, and at the time 
of a soma sacrifice \ It is clear that the Mit. does not expressly 
mention the wife or widow here. Supposing that she is impliedly 
referred to as a sapinda and as younger than her husband, this 
will at the most come to the requirement that on the death of the 
husband the wife had to undergo shaving, just as her son would 
have to do. But this passage cannot be used to support continual 
shaving of widows throughout life. Really 'anubhavinam' in Ap* 
cannot include the wife ; since if women were to be included by 
the rule of ekaiesa ( vide Panini I. %, 67 ) the absurd conclusion 
would follow that the daughters of the deceased and his younger 
brother's wives (who are all sapindas and younger) would have

to be shaved. The Nirnayasindhu 1S85 ( composed in 1612 A. D. ) 
and the BalambhaftI ( composed towards the end of the 18th 
century ) were both familiar with the tonsure of widows and so 
they interpret A p. and the Mit. as requiring shaving for the 
wife on the 10th day after the death of the husband and rely on 
a text of Vyasa quoted in Apararka. The BalambhattI says " the 
words 'on the death of the mother and father* are only illustra- 
tive and so the same rule applies to the husband's death." Even 
conceding all this far-fetched interpretation, there is no 
authority for the continual tonsure of widows throughout their 
lives in these passages. It may be noted that the Madana- 
parijata ,38< which contains the verse ( vidhava-kabarl-bandho 
&c. quoted above ) does not include the widow among ' anubhS- 
vinam \ but only male sapindas and sons. 

The foregoing discussion leads to the following conclusions. 
There is no express Vedic authority for the tonsure of widows. 
The grhya or dharma sutras do not refer to it ; nor do important 
smrtis like those of Manu and Yaj. If one or two smrti 
verses of doubtful import seem to refer to it, other smrtis 
like Vrddha-Harlta are to an opposite effect. Some of the 
smrti texts only refer, if at all, to one shaving on the 
husband's death, but there is no smrti passage prescribing 
continual shaving for widows. There is only the Skandapurana 
passage expressly requiring tonsure of widows. The Mit. 
and Apararka are silent about it. It appears that the practice 
was gradually evolved after the 10th or 11th century. As widows 
were equated with yatis for several injunctions ( vide note 
1367 above ) and as the latter shaved themselves, widows were 
gradually required to do so. By rendering them ugly it might 
have been intended to keep them chaste. Probably the example 
of Buddhist and Jaina nuns may have also suggested the cruel 
practice. We find from the Cullavagga l387 that Buddhist nuns

Ch. XII ] The tonsure of widows 593 

cut off their hair and put on orange-coloured robes. In Mah5Â« 
rastra brahraana widows a few years ago wore a garment that 
was reddish ( and even now a few old widows do wear it ). At 
all events the practice is not very old and hardly any digest 
before the Madanaparijata ( 14fch century ) quotes the Skanda* 
purana text. The practice is dying out and deserves to be 
suppressed at once, though strange insistence on it sometimes 
obtains public notoriety. Recently the worshippers in the 
famous shrine of Vithoba at Pandharpur in MahSrastra pre- 
vented an untonsured brahmana widow from having darsana of 
the idol in the customary way i. e. by placing the head on the 
feet of the idol, while they were prepared to allow untonsured 
widows of all castes ( excapt the so called untouchables ), and 
even Hindu prostitutes in the keoping of Christians or Maho- 
medans to have dariana in that way. The matter came before 
a civil court, where it was decided in favour of the widow 
that no such discrimination could be allowed to prevail, but 
owing to certain unforeseen circumstances the case did not 
come before the Bombay High Court. 

It would be of interest to many to learn that among one 
sect ( the Tengalai ) of the SrI-vaisnavas ( followers of Rama- 
nuja ) tonsure of widows has been forbidden for centuries, 
though that sect is most orthodox in other matters. 1388 Tho 
Sudrakamalakara remarks that widows in Gauda keep 
their hair. 1389 

From very ancient times, it appears the idea was that 
women should not be killed on any account. The Sat. Br. 
( XL 4. 3. 2, S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 62 ) says 139 Â° * people do not kill 
a woman, but rather take ( anything ) from her ( leaving her ) 
alive \ It was only the king who was authorised, according to 
Vis varupa, to punish a woman to death for adultery with a 
man of a very low caste ( vide Gaut. and Manu VIII. 371 quoted 
above on p. 572 ), but the king had to undergo a slight penance 
for doing this ( vide Yaj, III. 268 ). Manu XL 190 ordains that 
one who killed a woman was not to be associated with, even 
after he performed the requisite penance. Manu IX. 232 calls

upon the king to punish with death those who murder women, 
children and brahmanas. The Mahabharata frequently refers 
to this chivalrous rule. Xdiparva mi 158. 31 says * those who 
know dharma declare that women are not to be killed \ The 
Sabhaparva 41. 13 prescribes ' one 's weapons should not be 
directed against women, cows, brahmanas, against one who 
gave livelihood or shelter '. In the Santiparva ( 135. 14 ) even 
thieves are instructed not to kill women, Vide also Adi. 155. 2, 
217. 4, Vanaparva 206. 4G. The Ramayana (Balakanda) also 
breathes this sentiment, when Rama was called upon to kill the 
ogress Tataka. 

Even for the most serious offence of adultery with a man 
of a low caste Yaj. II. 286 prescribes for the woman the punish- 
ment of cutting the ear &c. Similarly Vrddha-Harita VII. 192 
prescribes the cutting of the nose, ear and lip for attempt to 
murder the husband or her foetus. Vide Yaj. II. 278-279 for 
the sentence of death in the case of women for certain offences. 

It has been seen how women gradually lost the privilege of 
upanayana, of studying the Veda, of having all the sarhskaras 
performed with Vedic mantras and how they came to be 
regarded as entirely dependent on men. Their position became 
assimilated to that of the sudras 1392 in many matters. A few 
examples will be cited here. All dvijatis were to sip water 
thrice ( acamana ) for purifying their body, but women and 
sudras were to sip water only once for that purpose ( Manu 
V. 139, Yaj. I. 21 ). The dvijatis were 1S9S to take their bath to 
the accompaniment of Vedic mantras, while women and sudras 
were to bathe silently. Sudras and women were to perform 
what is called amasraddha (i. e. sraddua without cooked food). 1394 
The same penance was prescribed for killing a sudra or a 
woman ( Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 11-12, Parasara VI. 16 ). Ordinarily 
women, children and very old men could not be witnesses ( Yaj.

Ch. XII ] Women and sudras equated 595 

II. 70, Narada, rnadana, vv. 178, 190, 191), but Manu 
VIII. 68, 70, Yaj. II. 72, and Narada, rnadana 155 allowed 
women to be witnesses in disputes between women or when no 
other witness could be had or in the cases of theft, adultery and 
other offences in which force was an element. Documents 
taken from or transactions ( particularly gift, sale and mortgage 
of lands or houses ) made wifch women were ordinarily to be 
treated as voidable like those brought about by force or fraud 
(vide Narada, rnadana 26, 137, Yaj. II. 31). But this instead 
of being regarded as a disability was rather a boon owing to the 
general illiteracy of women. The Trisfchalisetu ( of Narayana) 
quotes a passage of the Brhan-Naradlya purana to the effect that 
women, those whose upanayana has not been performed and 
sudras have no right to establish the images of Visnu or 
Siva. im 

If there were many and heavy disabilities on women in 
certain matters, they enjoyed in certain directions more privi- 
leges than men. It has been already seen that women were not 
to be killed" nor were they to be abandoned even when guilty of 
adultery. They also enjoyed the right of precedence on the road 
(vide p. 146 above). The daughter 13 " of a pahta was not regarded 
as patita, though the son of a patita was regarded as patita ( vide 
Vas. 13. 51-53, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 4, Yaj. III. 261). Women ,897 
had to undergo only half of the prayascitta that men had to 
undergo for the same lapse (Visnu Dh. S. 54. 33, Devala 30, &c). 
Women received 1298 honour according to the ages of their 
husbands, whatever their own ages may be (Ap. Dh. S. 
I. 4. 14, 18 ). Just as brahmanas learned in the Vedas were to 
be free from taxes, the women of all varnas ( except those of 
pratiloma castes ) had to pay no taxes, 18M according to Ap. Dh.

S. II. 10. 26. 10-11 ). Vas. Dh. S. 19. 23 limits this exemption 
to women who are young or just delivered of a child. Pregnant 
women from the third month of pregnancy, forest hermits, 
samnyasins and brahmanas and brahmacarins had to pay no tax 
at a ferry ( Manu VIII. 407 and Visnu V. 132 ). According to 
Gaut. V, 23 and Yaj. I. 105 children, the daughters and sisters 
who are married and yet stay with thoir parents or brothers, 
pregnant women, unmarried daughters, guests and servants are 
to be fed before the master and mistress of the house; while 
Manu III. 114 and Visnu Dh. S. 67. 39 go a step further and say 
that freshly married girls of the family, unmarried girls, 
pregnant women are to be fed even before guests. A judicial 
proceeding in which a woman wa3 a party, or whioh was 
heard at night or outside the village or inside a house ( i. e. 
not in public ) or before enemies was liable to be reviewed 
( Narada uo Â° I. 43 ). Ordinarily trial by ordeal did not apply to 
a woman, whether she was plaintiff or defendant, but if at all a 
woman had to prove her case by ordeal, only the ordeal of tula 
( balance ) was prescribed for her ( Yaj. II. 98 and Mit. thereon ). 
In succession to stridhana property, daughters were preferred to 
sons. Women did not lose their stridhana by adverse possession 
( Yaj. II. 25, Narada, rnadana 82-83 ). Women were always to 
be consulted about acara. Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 15 cites ttie 
view that rules not stated in the sutra are, according to 
some teachers, to bo understood from women and from men of 
all castes. Ap. gr. II. 15 prescribes that in marriage the usages 
to be followed are to be learnt from women. Vide also Asv. gr. 
I. U. 8, Manu II. 223, Vaik. III. 21. ]m 

One interesting question is whether the practice of purda 
now in vogue among Moslems and also among Hindus in certain 
provinces of India prevailed in anoient times. Rg. X. 85. 33 
(used in the marriage rite) expressly calls upon people to look 
at the bride. 'This bride is endowed with great auspicious- 
ness; assemble together and see her; having given her bless- 
ings of good luck you may go to your house'. The Asv. 
gr. I. 8. 7 prescribes that at each halting place when the 
bride-groom is returning to his village with his bride he should

Oh. XII ] The usage of observing pur da 597 

look at the spectators with the verse Rg. X. 85. 33. 1402 This 
shows that no veil was worn by the bride and she appeared in 
public without one. Though in the marriage hymn there is a 
blessing ( Rg. X. 85. 46 ) that the bride was to dominate over her 
father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, 
it appears that that was only a blessing and the heart's 
wish, but the reality was somewhat different. The Ait. Br. 1403 
( 12. 11 ) says that the daughter-in-law is abashed in the 
presence of the father-in-law and goes away concealing 
herself from him. This indicates that there was some restraint 
for younger women when they were in the presence of 
elders. But in the grhya and dharma sutras there is no 
reference to any veil for women when moving in public. Panini 
III. 2. 36 teaches the formation of * asiiryampasya ' ( who do not 
see the sun ) applied to queens. That only shows that royal 
ladies did not leave the precincts of the palace and come under 
public gaze. In the Ayodhya-kanda 1404 ( 33. 8 ) it is said ' people 
walking on the publio road see to-day Slta who could not 
formerly be seen even by aerial beings \ Similarly it is stated 
in the same kanda ( 116. 28 ) * the appearance of a woman in 
public is nob blamable in misfortunes, difficulties, in wars, 
in svayamvara, in a sacrifice, and in a marriage \ In the 
Sabhaparva 1405 69. 9 DraupadI exclaims * we have heard that 
ancient people did not take married women to the public 
assembly-hall; that ancient and long-standing practice has 
been contravened by the Kauravas*. She says this after 
referring to the fact that, since she was seen at her svayamvara 
by the kings, she was never seen again by them till the day she

sees the polester and ArundhatI and is addressed to these latter. In 
Hir. Gr. I. 19. 4 this verse is repeated by the bridegroom when the bride 
is brought to hirn before the fire, which is about to be kindled.

was brought to the assembly-hall when Yudhisthira gambled 
and lost everything. This shows that women, particularly high- 
born ladies, did not appear in public except on certain occasions, 
but it does not follow that they always wore the veil. When 
the Kauravas were routed the Salyaparva ( 29. 74 ) laments that 
their ladies whom even the sun did not see in their palaces were 
Been by the common people who had come to the capital. Vide 
also Sabhaparva 97. 4-7, Salyaparva 19. 63, Strlparva 9. 9-10, 
Asrama-vasi-parva 15. 13. In the Harsacarita ( IV ) princess 
RajyasrI, whom the intended bride-groom Grahavarma came to 
see just before marriage, is described as having her face covered 
with a veil of fine red cloth. In another place, while describing 
the country of Sthanvlsvara ( modern Thanesar ) BSna says 
1 where bees drawn by the fragrance of the breaths of the ladies 
( and hovering round their faces ) served as a charming veil for 
their faces and the veil actually worn by them became a mere 
redundancy worn because it was the practice of high-born 
ladies to wear one \ In the Kadambarl also ( para 99 ) Bana 
describes Patralekha as covering her face with a veil of red 
cloth. In the Sakuntala 1408 when Sakuntala is taken to the 
court of Dusyanta she is described as wearing a veil. So it must 
be conceded that ladies of high rank did not appear in public 
without a veil, but ordinarily women did not wear any veil. It 
Is probably after the advent of the Moslems that the wearing of 
a veil, which was not quite unknown, became general among 
Hindu women in Northern and Eastern India. Vide Indian 
Antiquary for 1933 p. J 5, where a passage is quoted from the 
Sankhyatattva-kaumudi of Vacaspati ( 9th century A. D. ) 
referring to ladies of good family not appearing in public 
without a veil and Pathak Commemoration vol. p. 72 for 
references from Buddhist works about the practice of purda.

CHAPTER XIII 

NIYOGA 

Niyoga â ( appointment of a wife or widow to procreate a 
son from intercourse with an appointed male ). 

Great divergence of views prevails about the origin and 
purpose of this practice. It will be best first to begin by- 
examining the most ancient smrtis that permitted this practice. 
Gaut. 1407 18. 4-14 have great bearing on this point. Gaut. 
18. 4-8 are : ' a woman whose husband is dead and who desires 
offspring may secure a son from her brofcher-in-law. She 
should obtain the permission of the elders U08 and have 
intercourse only during the menstrual period ( excluding the 
first four days ). She may obtain a son from a sapinda, a 
sagotra, a sapravara or one who belongs to the same caste 
( when there is no brother-in law ). Some ( hold that this 
practice is allowed ) with nobody except a brother-in-law. She 
shall not bear more than two sons (by this practice)*. Gaut. 
18. 11 says that a child begotten at the request of a living 
husband on his wife belongs to the husband. Gaut. ( 28. 32 ) 
says that such a son is called ksetraja. The wife is called 
ksetra u09 ( field ), the husband of the wife or widow is called 
ksetrin or ksetrika (to whom the wife or widow belongs) and the 
person appointed to produce offspring is called bijin ( one who 
sows the seed ) or niyogin ( Vas. 17. 64, one who is appointed ).

600 Jistory of Dharmaiaslra [ Ch. XIII 

The Vas. Db. S. ( 17. 56-65 ) similarly prescribes 14, Â° ' the 
father or brother of the widow (or widow's husband) shall 
assemble the gurus who taught or sacrificed for the deceased 
husband and his relatives and shall appoint her ( to raise issue 
for the deceased husband ). Let him not appoint a widow who 
is mad, not master of herself (through grief &c.) or is diseased 
or is very old, ( Up to ) sixteen years ( after puberty is the 
period for appointing a widow) nor shall an appointment 
be made if the person who is to approach her is sickly. Let him 
approach the widow in the muhurfa saored W!l to Prajapati like 
a husband, without dallying with her and without abusing or 
ill-treating her. No appointment shall be made through a 
desire to obtain ,412 the estate.' Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 17 ( S. B. E. 
vol. 14, p. 226 ) defines a ksetraja son as one who is begotten by 
another man after permission on the wife of a deceased person 
or of a eunuch or of one who is suffering from ( an incurable 
disease). Manu (IX. 59-61) says that a widow who is 
properly appointed may obtain offspring, in case there is total 
failure of issue, from her brother-in-law or a sapinda of her 
husband, that the person appointed should approach her in the 
dark and should be anointed with ghee and should procreate 
only one son and never two, while some say that he n*ay 
procreate two. Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 68-70, Yaj. I. 68-69 and 
Narada ( strlpumsa, 80-83 ) lay down similar rules. Kautilya 
( 1. 17, p. 35 ) says that a king who is old or suffering from 
( incurable ) disease should procreate a son on his queen through 
a matrbandhu or a feudatory chief endowed with qualities 
similar to his. In another place he says that if a brahmana 
dies without leaving a near heir, then a sagotra or matrbandhu

1412. The idea is that the widow must not be moved to the act by 
a mercenary motive. According to t*f^*3T whose views are cited in the 
MkflWc^ of fasrfa** ( PÂ« 633 ) the widow of a separated sonless man 
could get the property of her husband only if she submitted to niyoga, 
otherwise she was to get only maintenance. DhSre6rara apparently based 
his view on some ancient texts. Vas. in the last sentence negatives 
such a

may be appointed to procreate a ksetraja son, who should get the 
inheritance. 1413 The conditions necessary to allow niyoga were : 
(1) the husband, whether living or dead, must have no son; (2) 
the gurus in a family council should decide to appoint the 
widow to raise issue for the husband ; (3) the person appointed 
must be either the husband's brother, or a sapinda or sagotra of 
the husband or ( according to Gautama, a sapravara or a person 
of the same caste ); (4) the person appointed and the widow must 
be actuated by no lust but only by a sense of duty; (5) the 
person appointed must; be anointed with ghee or oil (Narada, 1414 
strlpumsa, 82 ), must not speak with or kiss her or engage in 
sportive dalliance with the woman ; (6) this relationship was to 
last till one son was born ( or two according to some); (7) the 
widow must be comparatively young, she should not be old or 
sterile or past child-bearing or sickly or unwilling or pregnant 
(Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 70, Narada, strlpumsa 83-84); (8) after the birth 
of a son they were to regard themselves as father-in-law and 
daughter-in-law (ManuIX. 62). It is further made clear by 
the texts that if a brother-in-law has intercourse with his 
sister-in-law without appointment by elders or if he does so 
even when appointed by elders but the other circumstances 
do not exist (e.g. if the husband has a son), he would be 
guilty of the sin of incest ( vide Manu IX. 58, 63, 143, 144 and 
Narada, strlpumsa 85-86 ) and a son, born of such intercourse, 
would be a bastard and not entitled to any wealth ( Narada, 
strlpumsa 84-85 ) and that he would ,4,s belong to the begetter 
( Vas. Dh. S. 17. 63 ). Narada says that if a widow or a male 
acts contrary to the stringent provisions about niyoga, he or she 
should be severely punished by the king or ortherwiso there 
would be confusion. Yaj. II. 234 makes such a person liable 
to be sentenced to a fine of one hundred punas. It will be seen 
from the above that even in the times of the Dharmasutras, 
the practice of niyoga was hedged round with so many restric-

tions that it must not have been very much prevalent and 
instances must have been rather rare. 

While ancient Dharmasutras like Gautama allowed 
niyoga, there were other dharmasutras and writers almost as 
old as Gautama that condemned the practice and forbade it. 
Ap. Dh. S. u16 II. 10. 27. 5-7 after referring to the view of some 
that a girl is given to a family in marriage and declaring that 
that practice ( of polyandry ) is forbidden adds a condemnation 
of niyoga ' the hand ( of a sagotra is considered to be ) that of a 
stranger ; that if ( the marriage vow ) is transgressed, both 
( husband and wife ) certainly go to hell and that the reward 
obtained from observing the restrictions of the law is preferable 
to offspring obtained in this manner (by niyoga).' Baud. Dh. S f 
II. 2. 38 refers 1417 to the view of Aupajanghani that it is only the 
aurasa son that is to be recognized as a son and then quotes three 
verses ( probably of the same ancient sage ), which are also cited 
as quotations by Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 6. 13. 6 ) and which call upon 
husbands to guard their wives and not allow others to procreate 
sons on the latter, as the sons so procreated will benefit only the 
begetter. Manu, though at first he describes niyoga % ultimately 
condemns it in the strongest terms possible ( IX. 64-68 ). He 
says that among dvijafcis a widow should never be appointed 
to raise issue from another, for by doing so ancient dharraa 
would be violated, that in the mantras relating to marriage 
there is no reference to niyoga nor is the remarriage of a 
widow spoken of in the procedure about marriage, that niyoga 
is a beastly way and was first brought into vogue by king Vena 
who thereby caused var?ia-samkara t and that since that time 
good men condemn him who through ignorance appoints a 
widow to produce offspring. Manu ( IX. 69-70 ) explains the 
meaning of niyoga by saying that the rules and the ancient 
texts about niyoga apply or refer to that case only where, after 
a girl is promised as a bride, the intended bridegroom dies, the

brother of the latter is called upon to marry the girl and to 
have intercourse with her only once during each period till 
she gives birth to a son who would be the son of the deceased. 
Though Manu condemned the ancient practice of niyoga, he 
had to make provision for the kselraja son as regards partition 
(IX. 120-121,145). It should be noticed that if the inter- 
pretation of Manu IX. 69-70 be accepted, the word * vidhava ' 
would have to be taken in two different senses in Manu and 
other texts e. g. in IX. 60 where Manu speaks of niyoga, the 
word means a girl promised to a bridegroom who died before 
the marriage ceremony was gone through, while in Manu 
IX. 64 * vidhava ' means * a widow whoso husband died after 
marriage was completed, ' To say the least, this contravenes 
the canon of Mimamsa interpretation that the same word in 
the same passage or context should have only one meaning. 
Brhaspati 1418 refers to the fact that the Manusrarfci first des- 
cribed the ancient niyoga and then forbade it and adds that in 
former ages men possessed tapas and knowledge and could 
strictly carry out the rules while in dvapara and kali ages 
there is great deterioration of power and so men of these times 
cannot now practise niyoga. The several kinds of sons will 
be dealt with under vyavahara. 

The Visnu Dh. S. (15.3) contains an innovation which is not 
found in the sutras of Gautama and Vasistha viz. the ' kselraja 
is one 1419 who is procreated on an appointed wife or widow by a 
sapinda of the husband or by a brahmana. ' The Mahabharata 
is replete with cases of niyoga. Adiparva ( 95 and 103 ) 
narrates how Satyavati pressed Bhlsma to procreate sons for 
bis younger brother VicitravSrya ( who was dead ) from his 
queens and how ( Adi, 105 ) when Bhlsma refused Vyasa ulti- 
mately was appointed by Vyasa's mother Satyavati and pro- 
created Dbrtarastra and Pandu. Kum5rilabhatta mo replies to

rthQ objector finding fault wifch Vyasa by saying that VySsa 
followed Gaut. (18. 4-5) and the urgent request of his mother and 
besides his tapas saved him from the effects of violation of dharma. 
Pandu himself is said to have asked KuntI to procreate sons for 
him by niyoga from a brahmana endowed with great tapas 
( Adi. 120 ) and tells her certain stories of niyoga (Adi. 120-123 ) 
and winds up by saying that three sons is 1421 the limit and that 
if a fourth or a fifth were procreated the woman would be svairinl 
( a wanton woman ) and bandhakl ( harlot ). Adiparva ( chap. 
64 and 104 ) states that when Parasurama tried to exterminate 
the ksatriyas thousands of ksatriya widows approached 
brahmauas for the procreation of sons. 1422 Vide Adiparva, 
chap. 10 i and 177, Anusasana, chap. 44. 52-53, Santi 72. 12 for 
other references and examples of niyoga. u22 

Owing to the bewildering and often conflicting rules about 
niyoga in the smrtis, commentators like Visvarupa, Medhatithi, 
who wrote at a time when niyoga was almost unheard of, made 
heroic though unsatisfactory efforts to bring order out of chaos. 
Visvarupa on Yaj, I. 69 states several views on the point. The 
first is that niyoga is bad in the present age as opposed to 
smrti texts ( like Manu IX. 64 and $8 ) and to the usage of the 
sistas ( respectable people ). The second view was the same as 
Manu IX. 69 set out above. A third view was that there was an 
option ( as niyoga was both forbidden and allowed ). A fourth 
view (which seems to be the view of Visvarupa himself) was that 
the smrti texts about niyoga refer to sudras 1424 ( Manu IX. 64 
uses the word * dvijati ' ) and it was also allowed to royal 
families, when there was no male to succeed ( and only a brah- 
mana was to be appointed ) and Visvarupa relies upon two

further says that the procreation of sons by VySsa from the 
queens of Vicitravlrya should be paid no heed ( i. e. is not to be 
relied on ) like the marriage of DraupadI ( to the five Pandavas), 
The Mahabharata probably reflects what happened owing to the 
incessant Internecine wars among the priaccs of India. Whole 
princely houses must have been slaughtered. If niyoga was 
prevalent among them, the males appointed, when they had to 
be of the same caste, would have beQn ordinary soldiers ( ksatri- 
yas). The proud princely families very likely thought it 
below their dignity to associate widowed queens with ordinary 
ksatriyas. It is possible to hold that they chose brahmanas for 
appointment, as the latter wore deemed to be higher than even 
kings in the spiritual domain. It is impossible to believe that 
brahmanas, who had no temporal power, coald coerce the proud 
and warlike caste into choosing brahmanas for niyoga, unless 
the teaching of the smrtis fell in with the notions of the ruling 
houses themselves to some extent at le.^st. 

There was difference of opinion as to whom the child of 
niyoga belonged. Vas. Dh. S. 17. 6 expressly refers to this 
divergence. The first view was that the child belonged to the 
begetter; this view would cut at the very root of the purpose 
for which niyoga was recommended. Nirukta 1426 III. 1-3 
supports this view and relies on Rg. VII. 4. 7-8. Gaut. 18. 9 
and Manu IX. 181 state the same rule. Ap. Dh.S. IT. 6. 13.5 says 
that according to a Biahmana text the son belongs to the 
begetter. The second view was that if there was an agreement 
between the elders of a widow and the person appointed or 
between the husband himself and the begetter that the child 
should belong to the husband, then the son belonged to the 
latter. Vide Gaut. 18. 10-11, Vas. 17. 8, Adiparva 104. 6. uw 
A third view was that the son belonged to both the begetter and 
the owner of the wife. This is the view of Narada (strlpumaa 
58 ), Yaj. II. 127, Manu IX, 53, Gaut. 18. 13.

600 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XIII 

As shown above ( in note 1418 ) niyoga was forbidden in 
the Kali age by Brhaspati and it was included among practices 
forbidden in the Kali age by several works. Vide the Mit. on 
Yaj. II. 117 and Apararka p. 97 quoting Brahmapurana. 1487 * 

The practice of raising issue from the widow of one's 
brother or marrying her was a widespread one. Vide Wester- 
marck's 'History of Human Marriage* (1921) vol. III. pp. 
207-220. In the Rgveda uÂ£8 X. 40. 2 we read ' what sacrificer 
invites you ( Asvins ) in hi3 house as a widow invites a 
brother-in-law to her bed or as a young damsel her lover \ 
But it is not clear whether this refers to marrying the widow 
of a deceased brother or to the practice of niyoga. Visvarupa 
( on Yaj. I. 69 ) thinks that this refers to niyoga. The Nirukta 
( III. 15 ) explains Rg. X. 40. 2, where in some mss. the word 
' devara * is explained as * a second husband ' ( dvitlyo varah ). 
Medhatithi on Manu IX. 66 explains Rg. X. 40. 2 as applying to 
niyoga. According to the sufcras and smrtis niyoga was entirely 
different from marriage. In many ancient societies, women were 
inherited like property. On the death of the eldest brother, his 
younger brother took the family property as well as his widow. 
But the Rgveda had reached a stage much beyond that. Mac- 
Lennan thought that the practice of niyoga was due to polyandry. 
Westermarck combats this view and rightlyso. When niyoga 
was allowed in the sutras, polyandry had been either unheard 
of or forbidden. Jolly in Recht und Sitte ( English translation, 
pp. 156-157 ) thinks that apart from the religious importance of 
a son economic motives were at the bottom of the long list of 
secondary sons, including the ksetraja. This appears to be quite 
wrong. The practice of niyoga was a relic from the past and 
probably owed its origin to several causes, which are now 
obscure, but one of which was the great hankering for a son 
evinced by all in Vedio times. Vas. Dh. S. (17. 1-6) lends support 
to this view, since after quoting Vedic passages about the 
importance of a son for paying off the debt to ancestors and for 
securing heavenly worlds, he at once proceeds to the description 
of the ksetraja. But the economic motive was never put forward 
by any of the sages, nor could it possibly have been the reason

and main-spring of the practice. If many secondary sons were 
desired for economic reasons, then the same man could have had 
any number of secondary sons. But the dharmasSstra texts do 
not allow this. A man who has an aurasa son can have no 
ksetraja or adopted son. If one kind of son was adopted, then 
another kind of son could not bo adopted. So economic motives 
did not at all form the origin of this practice. Winternitz in 
J. R. A. S. for 1897 at p. 758 puts forward poverty, paucity of 
women and the joint family system as the causes of niyoga. 
There are no data to prove that there was paucity of women in 
India during historic times. There might have been a paucity 
of men owing to wars. Nor do the other two reasons bear close 
examination. It is better to say that niyoga was a survival 
from the remote past, that gradually it became rarer and rarer 
till in the first centuries of the Christian era it came to be totally 
prohibited. 



CHAPTER XIV 

REMARRIAGE OF WIDOWS 

Remarriage of widows. â The word punarbhu is generally 
applied to a widow that has remarried. Before going into the 
detailed history of the remarriage of widows it ig desirable to 
probe into the meaning of the word * punarbhu \ UZ9 Narada 
( strlpurhsa, v. 45 ) says that there are seven sorts of wives 
( mentioned in order ) who have been previously married to 
another man ( parapurva ) ; among them, the punarbhu is of 
three kinds u2 Â° and the svairinl ( wanton woman ) is of four 
kinds. The three punarbhus are : (1) a maiden whose hand was 
taken in marriage but whose marriage was not consummated ; in 
her case the marriage ceremony has to be performed once more ; 
(2) a woman who first deserts the husband of her youth, betakes 
herself to another man and then returns to the house of her 
husband ; (3) a woman who is given by the husband's relatives 
( when the husband dies ) to a sapinda of the deceased husband 
or a person of the same caste, on failure of brothers-in-law ( this 
is nigoya and no ceremony is to be performed ). The four 
svairinls are : (i) a woman, whether childless or not, who goes 
to live with another man through love while the husband is 
alive ; (2) a woman who rejects after her husband's death his 
brothers and the like and unites herself with another through 
passion for him ; (3) a woman, coming from a foreign country 
or purchased with money or oppressed by hunger or thirst, gives 
herself to a man saying ' I am yours' ; (4) a woman who is 
given to a stranger by the elders relying on the usages of the

Oriental Journal (1915) vol. 29, pp. 172-203 for discussion of some 
Vedic passages bearing on tho question. 

1430. Compare Manu IX. 176 and Vi?mi 15, 8 for the first 

punarbha, Manu IX. 176, Vas. Dh. S. 17. 19 and Visnu 15. 9 for the second 
punarbhn. 



Oh. XIV ] Meaning of punarbhu 609 

country, but who incurs the blame of wantonness ,4?1 ( as the 
smrti rules about niyoga are not observed by them or 
her ). Narada says that eaoh preceding one of the punarbhus 
and svairinls enumerated is inferior to the next in order. Yaj. 
( I. 67 ) does not give this elaborate classification ; all he says 
is that a punarbhu is of two kinds, one whose marriage had not 
been consummated and another who has bad sexual intercourse 
and that both have the marriage ceremony performed again 
( i. e. punarbhu is one who is ' punah sarhskrta ) ; a svairinl is 
one who forsakes the husband whom she married when a 
maiden and lives with another man of the same caste through 
love for the latter. Visvarupa on Yaj. I. 67 remarks that the 
elaborate classification of Narada and Sahkha (3 punarbhus 
and i svairinls ) is not of much use, that it only indicates the 
various degrees of blame ( or sin ) attaching to them and is also 
meant to discriminate among prayascittas to be performed by 
those women. It is the second husband and the son of the 
second marriage that bear the appellation ' paunarbhava * ( pati 
or putra respectively ) and not the first husband. Vide Sam. 
Pr. pp. 740-741. The Sm. C. ( I. p. 75 ) quotes a passage from 
Baudhayana and certain verses of Kasyapa. According to 
Kasyapa u3a the seven kinds of punarbhu are : (1) the girl who 
had been promised in marriage, (2) one who was intended to be 
given ; (3) one on whose wrist the auspicious band was tied by 
the bride-groom, (4) whose gift had been made with water ( by 
the father ), (5) whose hand was held by the bridegroom, (6) 
who went round the fire, (7) who had given birth to a child 
after marriage. In the first five cases it is to be supposed that 
the bride-groom either immediately died or left the further pro- 
secution of the marriage rites. Even such girls would be styled 
punarbhus, when they married another person later on, though 

1431. Dr. Jolly in his translation of Narada (S. B. B. vol. 33 pp. 
175-176) renders this verse of NSrada differently; but his rendering 
appears to me to be incorrect. The 3rd kind of punarbha refers to the 
practice of niyoga; the 4th kind of svairinl is one who is allowed to have 
intercourse by her elders for procreating a son for her deceased husband 
but without observing the strict rules of niyoga laid down in the 
smrtis. That is the difference between the two. The action of the ^fttrfr 
is described as *rrf*r, as it is no more than vyabhicnra, though with the 
elder's permission.

the first marriage was not complete because the saptapadl had 
not been performed. The sixth case is one of completed marriage 
(though it refers to only going round fire). Baudhayana's seven 
varieties are slightly different, the first two being the same as 
Kasyapa's : the others are (3) one who went round the fire (with 
the bridegroom) ; (4) one who took the seventh step; (5) one who has 
had sexual intercourse (either after marriage or even without it) 5 
(6) one who has conceived ; (7) one who has borne u28 a child. 
These meanings of the word punarbhu must be borne in mind when 
one meets with the word punarbhu in Vedic texts. That even the 
promise to give in marriage without the performance of any cere- 
monies was looked upon as tantamount in its consequences to 
marriage follows from the words of Sukanya quoted above (in note 
1306) from the Sat. Br., where she had been only offered to the sage 
Cyavana by her father, but where no ceremonies had been perform- 
ed as none are described or referred to therein. Manu (IX. 69-70) 
confines the rules of niyoga to a girl who was only promised 
( vagdatta ) ; while Vas. Dh. S. XVII. 72 speaks of the vagdatta 
and one given with water as still a maiden, if no Vedic 
mantras have been repeated. 1434 Vas. Dh. S. XVII. 74 refers to 
the 4th variety of Baudhayana. Yaj. I. 67 when he speaks of 
ahsata refers to all the six varieties of Kasyapa or the first four 
varieties of Baudhayana and when he speaks of ' ksata ' he 
refers to the seventh variety of Kasyapa and the last three 
of Baudhayana. Vas. Dh. S. 1425 17 19-20 describes paunarbhava 
as the son of a woman, who leaves the husband of ber youth 
and after having lived with another person, re-enters the 
house of the husband or as the son of a woman who takes 
another husband after leaving an impotent, outcast or lunatic 
husband or after the death of the first husband. Baud. Dh. S. 
II. 2. 31 describes paunarbhava as the son of a woman who 
after abandoning an impotent or outcast husband goes to 
another husband. Narada ( strlpurhsa, v. 97 ), Parasara IV. 30 
and Agnipurana 154. 5-6 have the same verse * another husband

is ordained for women in five calamities viz. when the husband 
is lost ( unheard of ), is dead, has become a samnyasin, is 
impotent or is patita' u38 Great controversies have raged 
round this verse. Some like the Par. M. ( II. part I, p. 53 ) 
give the easy explanation (always given about inconve- 
nient texts ) that this verse refers to the state of society in 
another yuga (age) and has no application to the Kali age. 
Others like Medhatithi (on Manu V. 157) explain that 
the word pati means only 4 palaka â¢ ( guardian ). Medhatithi uw 
( on Manu III. 10 and V. 163 ) is not dead against niyoga, but 
he is opposed to the remarriage of widows. Even the Smrfcyar- 
thasara ( which belongs to about 1150 to 1200 A. D. ) mentions 
several views viz. some hold that a girl may be married to 
another if the bride-groom dies before saptapadl, others hold that 
she may be remarried if the first husband dies before con- 
summating the marriage, while still others are of opinion that 
if after marriage the husband dies before she begins to mens- 
truate she may be remarried and some hold that remarriage 
is allowed before conception. 14S8 

Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 3-4 condemns remarriage ' if one has 
intercourse with a woman who had already another husband, or 
with a woman on whom no marriage samskara has taken place 
or who is of a different varna, then sin is incurred; in that case 
the son also is sinful'. Haradatta quotes Manu III. 174 and 
says that the son procreated on another's wife is called kunda if 
the husband is living, and golaka if the husband is dead. Manu 
V. 162 is opposed to the remarriage of widows 'nowhere is a second 
husband declared for virtuous women'; so also Manu IX. US9 65

( ' in the procedure of marriage there is no declaration about 
the remarriage of widows ) t Manu IX. 47 ' a maiden can be 
given only once ' and Manu VIII. 226 ( the Vedic mantras used 
in panigrahana are applicable to maidens only ) are opposed 
to the remarriage of widows. The Brahmapurana and other 
puranas forbid remarriage of widows in the Kali age ( vide note 
1427a above). The Sam. Pr. quotes a text of Katyayana to the 
effect that a girl, who has gone through the ceremony of 
marriage with a sagotra, may be married again and remarks 
that the text refers to the state of society in another yuga. This 
is the view of all the commentators and nibandha writers. 
Manu himself ( in IX. 176 ) expressly allows the samskara 
of remarriage in the case of a girl, whose first marriage 
has not been consummated or who left the husband of her 
youth, went to live with another and returned to the first 
husband. In this the author of the Manusmrti probably only 
reiterates popular usage which was too much for him in spite 
of his own view ( in V. 162 ) denouncing remarriages. So it 
may be taken that Manu does not forbid the use of mantras in 
remarriage, but holds that even after the mantras are recited the 
remarriage of a widow is not dharmya ( approved ). It is said 
in the Mahabharata ( Adiparva 104. 34-37) that Dlrghatamas 
forbade remarriage and also niyoga. 144 Â° Manu himself speaks 
of the samskara of a pregnant girl ( IX. 172-173 ). Baud. Dh. 
S. IV. 1. 18, Vas. Dh. S. 17. 74, Yaj. I. 167 speak of the samskara 
of remarriage ( paunarbhava samskara ). Manu III. 155 and 
Yaj, I. 222 include the paunarbhava ( the son of a punarbhu ) 
among brahmanas that are not to be invited at a sraddha. 
Apararka (p. 97 ) quotes a passage from the Brahmapurana 
itself which speaks of a fresh samskara of marriage for a ohild 
widow or for one who was forcibly abandoned or carried away 
by somebody. 1441 

Several smrtis contain certain rules about what the wife 
was to do when the husband had gone abroad for many years 
after marriage. Narada ( strlpumsa, verses 98-101 ) gives the

following directions. u " 4 If the husband has gone to a foreign 
country a brahmana wife should wait for eight years, but four 
years if she has not given birth to a child ; after that period (of 
8 or 4 years ) she may resort to another man ( then Narada lays 
down lesser number of years for ksatriya and vaisya wives). If 
the husband is known to be living then the periods are double 
of those stated above; this is the view of Prajapati when 
no news can be had of persons and hence there is no sin if a 
woman resorts to another man ( in such cases )/ Manu ( IX. 76 ) 
says ' If a man has gone to a foreign land for doing some 
religious duty the wife should wait for him for eight 
years, six years if he has gone for acquiring knowledge or 
fame, or three years if he has gone on a love affair ( or for 
another wife ). ' Manu does not state what the wife is to do 
after these years of waiting. Vas. ( 17. 75-76 ) requires that 
1 the wife of one who has gone to a foreign land should wait 
for five years and after five years she should go near her 
husband. ' This may be all right as far as it will go. But 
if the husband is unheard of, how is she to reach him ? 
Vasistha says nothing on that point. Visvarupa on Yaj. I. 69 
says that the periods of waiting prescribed for the wife of an 
emigrant are meant not for permitting niyoga thereafter, but 
for calling upon her to repair to her husband. Kau^ilya (III. 4) 
prescribes some interesting rules : 4 the wife of one, who has 
long gone abroad, or who has become a recluse or who is dead , 
should wait for seven menstrual periods and for a year if she 
has a child already. Thereafter she may marry the full 
brother of her husband. If there be many brothers she should 
marry one who is near in age ( to the first husband ), who is 
virtuous, capable of maintaining her or who is the youngest or 
unmarried. If no such brother exists she may marry a sapinds 
of the husband or one of the same caste.' The'story of DamayantI 
suggests that when the husband was not heard of for manj 
years, a wife could marry again. DamayantI is said to have 
sent a message to Rtuparna that, as Nala was not heard oi 
for many years, DamayantI was going to celebrate a svayam- 
vara and Rtuparna hurries for it and does not think it a Strang* 
thing ( Vanaparva 70. 24 ).

614 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XIV 

One question 1448 raised by Dr. Banerjee is : what is to be 
regarded as the gotra of a widow when she is to be remarried 
( is it to be her father's gotra or of the first husband's ? ). There 
are hardly any indications in the ancient smrtis or commenta- 
ries on this point. Visvarupa 1444 commenting on Y&j. I. 63 (on 
the word 4 kany&prada ' ) observes that according to some the 
father gives away the bride even if 9he is not a virgin. So it 
appears that the father's gotra should be looked to in the 
remarriage of a widow. Vidyasagar, whom Dr. Banerjee 
follows, held the same opinion. 

Certain passages of the Atharvaveda may be considered 
in connection with the question of the remarriage of widows. 
Atharva-Veda V. 17. 8-9 are 1445 ' when a woman has at first even 
ten husbands, who are not brahmanas, if a brahmana takes hold 
of her hand ( i. e. marries her ), he alone is her ( real ) husband. 
A brahmana alone is ( a real ) husband, not a ksatriya or a 
vaisya â the sun goes proclaiming this to the five (tribes of) men'. 
The first verse is not to be taken literally in the sense that a 
woman married ten persons in succession and that the 11th 
was a brahmana ; the first verse contains rather what is called 
* praudhivada ' (pompous assertion or boast) and this is indi- 
cated by the word ' uta *. The verse may at the most mean 
that if a woman has first a ksatriya or vaisya as husband, and 
she marries on his death a brahmana, then the brahmana is the 
real husband. The word 4 pati' may also have been used loosely 
and all that is meant may be that if a girl is promised to ten 
persons one after another and then lastly to a brahmana, the 
latter is to be accepted as the best. Another passage 144C of the 

1443. Vide * Marriage and Strldhana ' (5th ed. ) p. 309 * one of 
these rules of selection requires that the parties to marriage should be 
of different goiras ; but what is to be regarded as the gotra of a widow- 
the gotra of her father in which she was born or that of her deceased 
husband to which she has been transferred by marriage ? \

Ch. XIV ] Remarriage of widows 615 

Atharvaveda ( IX. 5. 27-28 ) is * whatever woman, having firit 
married one husband, marries another, if they (two) offer 
a goat with five rice dishes they would not be separated (from 
each other ). The second husband secures the same world with 
his remarried wife, when he offers a goat accompanied with five 
rice dishes and with the light of fees'. Here the word punarbhu 
occurs. It is possible to hold that this may refer to the promise 
of a girl in marriage, subsequent death of the intended 
bridegroom before the marriage ceremonies take place and 
then the bestowal of her on another. Whatever the meaning 
of punarbhu here may be, it is clear that some sort of sin 
or inferiority attached to her and that such sin or oppro- 
brium had to be removed by sacrifices. Other passages are dis- 
cussed later on. But it must be admitted that remarriage of 
women was not prohibited in the times of the Atharvaveda. 
In the Tai. S. III. 2. 4. 4 * daidhisavya ' ( widow's soa ) occurs. 
The grhyasufcras are silent about remarriage ; so probably by 
that time it had come to be prohibited generally, though sporadic 
instances might have occurred. Among the brahmanas and 
castes similar to them and holding or endeavouring to hold a 
high place in the hierarchy of castes widow remarriage has 
been forbidden for centuries. One of the earliest historical 
instances is the remarriage of DhruvadevI, queen of Ramagupta, 
who was after Ratnagupta's death, married by her brother-in-law 
Candragupta (vide Journal Asiatique for 1923, pp. 201-208, 
Sanjan Places in E. I. vol. 18, p. 255, ' Indian Culture * vol. 4, 
p. 216, Harsacarita VI, penultimate para ). Among sudras and 
other lower castes widow remarriage has been allowed by 
custom, though it is held to be somewhat inferior to the marriage 
of a maiden. 1447 Among these castes remarriage is allowed after 
the death of the husband or during his life-time with the 
consent of the husband who gives a writing called farkhat or 
sod'chitti ( a deed of release ). Such marriages are called pat in 
Maharastra, natra in Gujarat, udki in the Canarese districts. 
In some cases the caste in a meeting assembled takes upon itself 
to bring to an end a marriage and allows the wife to re-marry. 
But the Bombay High Court does not recognize the authority of 
a caste to declare a marriage void or to permit a woman to 
remarry another person without the consent of the husband 
and have convicted of bigamy women re-marrying without the

616 History of Dharmaiaatra [ Ch. XIV 

consent of the first husband but with the permission of the 
caste. 1448 In modern times, the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act 
(XV of 1856) has been passed mainly through the efforts of Pandit 
Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, That Act legalises the marriages 
of widows notwithstanding any custom or interpretation of the 
Hindu Law to the contrary and declares that the children of 
such marriages are legitimate. Owing to the sentiment of centu- 
ries widow remarriage is still looked down upon and during more 
than eighty years since the Act was passed not many widows have 
taken advantage of it. The Census 1449 of India for 1931 discloses 
certain appalling figures. Among infants of less than one year 
old there were in the whole of India as many as 796 males who 
were widowers and 1515 females who were widows, among 
children up to 5 years there were 12799 widowers and 30880 
widows ( out of these lasfe the Hindus contributed 10266 as 
widowers and 23667 as widows). It is true that amongst the castes 
to which most of these must have belonged widow remarriage is 
allowed by custom, but there must be a certain number of 
females who are widows before five, who cannot remarry by 
the custom of the caste and who would not dare to take advant- 
age of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act. Between the ages 
of 5-10, 11-15, 16-20 the numbers of Hindu widows for the 
whole of India are respectively 83920, 145449, 404167. The age 
of marriage for girls is rapidly rising owing to economic 
causes, the spread of literacy among the masses, and the opera- 
tion of the Child Marriage Restraint Act ( XIX of 1929 ) and it 
may be hoped that these high figures of child widows will be 
substantially reduced in the near future. Persons finding fault 
with Hindu society for large numbers of child widows should 
not forget one thing. According to Hindu notions every girl 
must be married at any cost. Hence people rush into child 
marriages. But there has been no problem of old spinsters in 
Hindu society, as there is in Western countries, though it 
appears that in the near future that problem will arise even in 
India. Apart from the considerations as to religious texts 
prohibiting widow remarriage and the great concern among 
women for preserving a high ideal of chastity and single-minded 
devotion to the husband, many Hindus feel that, each girl

having been given one chance of marriage, if she becomes a 
widow, that is her ill-luck, but she should not be allowed to 
compete with unmarried girls in the marriage market, which is 
already overcrowded with girls waiting to be married. 

Certain verses of the Ijtgveda and the Atharvaveda have 
given rise to various explanations and opinion is divided as to 
whether they refer to niyoga, to the remarriage of widows or to 
the practice of the immolation of widows. First the two verses 
Eg. X. 18. 7-8 ,45 Â° which are part of a fumral hymn will be set 
out : ' Let these women, who are not widows and who have good 
husbands, sit down with clarified butter used as collyrium ; may 
the wives who are tearless, free from disease and wearing fine 
jewels ( or clothes ) occupy the seat in front ( first ). O woman ! 
raise yourself towards the world of the living; yÂ«.u lie down 
near this departed ( husband ) ; come, this your wifehood of the 
husband who ( formerly ) held your hand and who loved you 
has ( now ) been fulfilled \ It is somewhat strange that Sayana 
understands the latter half as an invitation by the husband's 
brother to the wife of the departed to remarry him. But that 
meaning is far-fetched and does not bring out the proper force 
of ' hastagrabhasya', ' patyuh ' and 'babhutha'. The Asv. 
gr. 14S1 ( IV. 6. 11-12 ) prescribes that ( in the expiatory rite 
performed on the death of an elder ) the young women relatives 
should salve their eyes with butter with their thumb and fourth 
finger and with tender darbha blades and then throw the blades 
away, when the performer of the rite should look at them while 
they are salving their eyes with the verse ' ima narlr &c. \ The 
same sutra ( IV. 2. 16-18 ) says that " ( when a dead body is to

and a bow for a ksatriya ( if he be the dead person ) and then 
her brother-in-law or some one else who can be the represen- 
tative of her husband or a pupil or an old servant should make 
her rise up with the mantra * udlrsva ' ". The San. Sr. S. IV. 16. 16 
also directs tbat the verse Rg. X. 18. 7 is repeated when the eyes 
of women are touched with blades of kusa grass and XVI 13. 13 
says that Rg. X. 18. 8 and Rg. X. 85. 21-22 are called 'utthapiny ah* 
(verses addressed for making one rise). There is another mantra 
in the Atharvaveda ( 18. 3. 1 ) and Tai. Ar. VI. 1 1458 * Oh ( dead ) 
man ! this woman choosing the world of the husband lies down 
by thee, the deceased, observing the old universal custom ; 
bestow on her in this world offspring and wealth \ The first 
verse ( i. e. Rg. X. 18. 7 ) contains nothing about niyoga or 
remarriage. It has been made use of for giving Vedic 
authority to the practice of sati ( which will be dealt with later 
on ). That verse refers to the practice that young women of 
the household of the departed used to go to the cemetery and 
applied clarified butter to their eyes ( by way of purification and 
ianti ) ; this practice continued to the days of the Asv. gr , the 
Brhad-devata (VII 12 ) and the Baud, pitrmedhasutra ( 1.21.11). 
The two verses ' iyam nSrl ' and Rg. X. 18. 8 are employed by 
the Baudhayana-Pitrmedhasutra UiZ in the funeral rites, the 
first to be repeated when the wife is made to sit near the corpse 
and the next for making her rise. It is to be noted that Baud, 
directs that the corpse is placed on the funeral pile after the 
wife is made to rise from the vicinity of the corpse ; while the 
Brhad-devata appears to suggest that the wife ascends the 
funeral pile after the corpse is placed thereon and then the 
younger brother forbids her with the verse * udlrsva &c.\ But the 
Brhad-devata us * does not mean that the wife burns herself on 
the funeral pyre and the brother-in-law contents himself with 
only repeating a verse to dissuade her. The Rgvidhana US5 
(III. 8. 4) says that the brother-in-law should call back the wife

of his sonless brother when she is about to ascend the funeral pyre 
for procreating a son on her with Rg. X. 18. 8. It appears that 
the verse Rg X. 18. 8 symbolically describes what even in the 
days of the Rgveda was probably only a tradition viz. that in 
hoary antiquity a wife burnt herself with her *husband. In the 
times of the Rgveda this practice had altogether ceased, but a 
symbolical imitation of it had come into vogue, viz. that the 
wife Jay near the corpse in the cemetery and then she was asked 
to get up and was told that by following her husband to the 
very doors of death she had fulfilled all that was expected of 
her and that she should return. The same idea is referred to by 
the verse * iyam narl \ but the latter half appears to refer to the 
practice of niyoga when it calls upon the departed to bestow on 
the wife offspring and wealth. It is possible to argue that Rg. 
X. 18. 8 also impliedly has niyoga in view. But both these/ 
verses do not expressly refer to the parctice of S'di at all. They 
at the most might lead to the inference that the woman had 
either to marry the deceased husband's brother or go in for 
niyoga because the husband died sonless. The latter appears 
to me to be the more probable of the two hypothesas, if those are 
the only explanations. The symbolic use made in the grhyasutras 
and in the Brhad-devata of Rg. X. 18. 8 shows that they practically 
are against the burning of widows. It is probable that these 
authors knew of the custom of niyoga, that it was not then 
much approved of and so they are silent about it, while the 
Rgvidhana which appears to be comparatively a late work 
takes the verse * udlrsva ' as referring to niyoga ( which is most 
probably referred to in Rg. X. 40. 2 ko v&m sayutra vidhaveva 
devaram). The consideration of the practice of widow burning 
naturally arises here from the above discussion and will be 
dealt with in a separate chapter. 

Divorce 

In the Vedio literature there are at least some texts 
capable of being interpreted as relating to the remarriage 
of widows and we have the word ' punarbhu \ But as regards 
divorce there is absolutely nothing in the Vedic texts nor 
is there much in post-vedic literature. The theory of dharma- 
6astra writers is that marriage when completed by homa and 
saptapadl is indissoluble. Manu IX. 101 says 'Let mutual fide- 
lity (between husband and wife) continue till death; this in 
brief may be understood to be the highest dharma of man and wife.' 
In another place Manu (IX. 46) declares ' neither by sale nor by 



620 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XIV 

desertion is the wife released from the husband; we under- 
stand that this is the law ordained by the Creator in former 
times. ' The position of the writers on dharmasastra is that 
marriage is a samskara, that the status of wife-hood arises from 
that samskara, that even if the husband or wife became 
patita % the samskara already performed is not annulled by that 
fact, that even if a wife committed adultery she still remains 
a wife and that when she performs a penance for her lapse, it is 
not necessary to have a fresh samskara of marriage performed 
on her. 1458 We have seen (pp. 552-553) that a man was allowed 
to supersede a wife and marry another or others or to abandon 
his wife altogether in certain circumstances. But that does not 
amount to divorce ( i. e. dissolution of the marriage tie ) ; the 
marriage is still there intact. It was also shown (at pp. 610-611) 
that according to Narada, Parasara and a few others a woman 
was allowed to remarry in case the husband died, or was unheard 
of &c. ; but according to the digests and commentaries these 
rules apply to a former yuga ( age ). Therefore divorce in the 
ordinary sense of the word ( i. e. divorce a vinculo matrimonii ) 
has been unknown to the dharmasastras and to Hindu society 
for about two thousand years ( except on the ground of custom 
among the lower castes ). Even when the husband was allowed 
to abandon the wife for her lapse, still she was in most cases 
entitled to at least starving maintenance. Therefore tyaga 
( abandonment ) was not only no divorce a vinculo at all but 
was not even a divorce a mensa et thcro ( divorce from board 
and bed ). Later smrfcis and medieval digests could hardly 
conceive of any ground for which the wife could desert her 
husband altogether, though Narada and a few others allowed her 
to desert one husband and marry another if he was impotent, 
or became a samnyasin or an outcast. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 77 
says that a wife is not under the control of her husband as long 
as he remains patita ( outcast or excommunicated ) and that she 
should wait till he is purified by penance and restored to caste 
and that thereafter she again becomes dependent on him. The 
gravest sins can be expiated by penance ( vide Manu XL 89,

92, 101, 105-106 ) ; therefore ifc follows that a wife could not 
for ever desert even a patita husband. In modern times the 
Indian courts UST have held that mere change of faith or 
apostasy by a Hindu wife or husband does not ipso facto dis- 
solve the marriage and that if the wife changes her religion 
and then marries another while the first husband is still living, 
she would be guilty of bigamy. Mere desertion or separation for 
many years or even adultery does not dissolve a Hindu marriage 
( vide 42 Madras Law Journal 276 ). Only in cases where the 
husband or wife becomes a convert to Christianity, a special 
procedure is prescribed for the dissolution of the original Hindu 
marriage by the Native Converts' Marriage Dissolution Act (XXI 
of 1866), which is not set out here as it is beyond the scope of this 
work to do so. Further, those Hindus who marry under the Special 
Marriage Act ( III of 1872 as amended by Act XXX of 1923 ) 
can secure divorce under the Indian Divorce Act ( IV of 1869 ), 
The Malabar Marriage Act ( Madras Act IV of 1896 ) forbids 
polygamy if the first marriage is registered and allows divorce 
( sec. 19 ) among those who are governed by the Marumakkata- 
yam or Aliyasantana Law prevalent in Malabar. 

The Arthasastra of Kautilya contains some interesting 
observations bearing on divorce. 1 * 88 *A wife hating her husband 
cannot be released from the husband if he is unwilling ( to let 
her go ), nor can the husband release himself from the wif o 
( if she is unwilling ) ; but if there is mutual hatred then relent e 
is possible. If a man fearing danger ( or injury ) from his wife 
desires release from her, he shall return to her whatever was 
given to her ( at the time of marriage ). If a woman out of 
fear of danger (or injury) from the husband desires release, the 
latter need not return to her what was given to her ( at the 
time of marriage); marriages in the approved form cannot 
be dissolved. * Kautilya himself says ( in III. 2 ) that the first 
four forms viz. brahma, prajapatya, arsa and daiva are dharmya 
( approved ), since they are brought about under the authority 
of the father. 1459 Therefore according to Kautilya there can

be no dissolution of the marriage tie if the marriage was 
celebrated in one of the first four forms. But if the marriage 
was in the gÂ£ndharva, asura or raksasa form, then the tie 
may be dissolved by mutual consent, if both have come to hate 
each other. But he seems to hold that there can be no release 
at the instance of only one party to the marriage who has 
begun to feel aversion to the other party in whatever form the 
marriage may have been performed. Even in this latter case 
he apparently makes an exception, where physical danger is 
apprehended by one party from the other. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to compare the law of 
divorce in other countries or under other religious systems. It 
may be stated, however, that according to the strict theory 
of the Roman Catholic Church the marriage tie is indissoluble, 1410 
though decrees of nullity of marriage were sometimes granted 
by that Church to those who could pay for them. In England 
after the Restoration divorce could be secured through the 
Parliament by a private Bill where a divorce a vinculo matri- 
monii was desired. But this method could be resorted to only 
by the rich, as the passage of a private Bill for divorce cost at 
least 500 Â£. The Ecclesiastical courts in England granted 
divorces a mensa et thoro on the ground of adultery, cruelty or 
unnatural offences, though such a divorce did not dissolve the 
marriage. But this procedure also was costly, as even an un- 
defended suit for divorce a mensa et thoro would ordinarily cost 
from 300 to 500 Â£. Then came the Matrimonial Causes Act of 
1857 (20 and 21 Vic. chap. 85) by sec. 27 of which a wife 
could petition for divorce only if she proved that since the 
celebration of marriage the husband was guilty of inces- 
tuous adultery, or of bigamy with adultery, or of adultery coup- 
led with such cruelty as, without adultery, would have 
entitled her to a divorce a mensa et thoro or of adultery 
coupled with desertion. The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1923 
( 13 and 14 Geo. 5 chap. 19 ) placed women on an equality with 
men by allowing them to apply for divorce merely on the 
ground of adultery by the husband without having to prove 
anything more. Then the Act of 1937 known as A. P. Herbert's 
Act (lEdw. 8 and 1 Geo. 6 chap. 57 ) allows the husband or 
wife to petition for divorce on four grounds. It will be noticed

from this that the absence of divorce and rigorous restrictions 
thereon are not a peculiarity of the Brahraanical religion or of 
the caste system, but existed even in so-called progressive, 
casteless and Christian countries up to very recent times. In 
modern times even in Roman Catholic countries divorce is 
allowed on various grounds ; and in India too efforts are being 
made to enact legislation permitting divorce among Hindus for 
various reasons. And it may be admitted that some legal 
provision is necessary for securing divorce in hard cases even 
as to marriages celebrated under the ancient sastric system 
on grounds similar to those in the English Act of 1937, 



CHAPTER XV 

SATl ( Self-immolation of widows ) 

The word is often written as ' suttee ' in English works 
and papers. This subject is now of academic interest in India, 
since for over a hundred years ( i. e. from 1829 ) eelf-immolation 
of widows has been prohibited by law in British India and has 
been declared to be a crime. A portion of sec. 1 of the 
Regulation XVII of 1829 passed by the Governor-General 
Lord William Bentinck is set out below. We are now in a 
position to take a dispassionate view of the practice, to trace 
its origin and follow its working down to the date of its being 
declared illegal. It is not possible in the space available here 
to go into all details. Those interested may read the latest 
book on the subject by Mr. Edward Thomson. 1461 The burning

gives extracts from the accounts reported by those -who witnessed widow 
buiniDg from bl7 B C. to 1845 A. D. Vide also Max Muller's H. A. S. L. 
p. 48 for refeiences to the custom of widow-burning among Giecks and 
Scythians ; * Die Frau ' pp. 74-79 for accounts of travellers and eyo 
witnesses; Colebrooke's Miscellaneous "Essays vol. I (ed. of 1837) pp. 
114-116 (for description of the rite), vol. II. chap. III. pp. 153-158; 
Annals of the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute vol. 14. p. 219. In the * Travels 
of Poter Mundy ' ( 1608-1669 ) published by the Hakluyt Society in 1914 
vol. II. pp. 34-36, the author gives an account of the burning of a widow 
at Surat in 1630 with a sketch showing the widow having on her lap the 
head of her deceased husband. That writer also notes that the practice 
had in his time become rare, as under the Mogul rulers a special 
license from the Ruler or Governor was required. Similarly Barbosa 
(a Portuguese ) describes the burning of a sail in the Vijayanagar 
kingdom (vide translation by M. L, Dames, vol. I. pp. 213-216). 

Section 1 of Regulation XVII of 1829 which declared the practice of 
mti illegal and a crime punishable in the courts (and passed by the 
Governor-General in Council on 4th December 1829 ) is : The practice of 
Suttee or of burning or burying alivo the widows of Hindoos is revolt- 
ing to the feelings of human nature ; it is nowhere enjoined by the 
religion of the Hindoos as an imperative duty ; on the contrary a life of

of widows was not peculiar to Brahmanism, as many are prone 
to believe, but the custom owes its origin to the oldest religious 
views and superstitious practices of mankind in general. The 
practice of widow burning obtained among ancient Greeks, 
Germans, Slavs and other races ( vide * Die Frau ' pp. 56, 
82-83 and Schrader's 'Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan 
People,' English Translation of 1890, p. 391 and Wester- 
marck's ' Origin and Development of Moral Ideas \ 1906, vol. 
I, pp. 472-476 ), but was generally confined to the great ones, 
the princes and nobles. 

There is no Vedic passage which can be cited as incon- 
trovertibly referring to widow-burning as then current, nor is 
there any mantra which could be said to have been repeated in 
very ancient times 1468 at such burning nor do the ancient grhya- 
sutras contain any direction prescribing the procedure of widow 
burning. It therefore appears probable that the practice arose 
in Brahmanical India a few centuries before Christ. Whether 
it was indigenous or was copied from some non-Aryan or non- 
Indian tribes cannot be demonstrated. None of the dharmasutras 



( Conti?iued from last page ) 

purity and retirement on the part of the widow is more especially 
and preferably inculcated and by a vast majority of that people 
throughout India the practice is not kept up or observed ; in some 
extensive districts it does not exist ; in those in which it has been most 
frequent, it is notorious that, in many instances, acts of atrocity have 
been perpetrated, which have been shocking to the Hindoos themselves, 

and in their eyes unlawful and wicked Actuated by these 

considerations the Governor-General in Council, without intending to 
depart fiom one of the first and most important piinciple9 of the 
system of British Government in India that all classes of the people be 
secure in the observance of their religious usages, so long as that 
system can be adhered to without violation of the paramount dictates of 
justice and humanity, has deemed it right to establish the following 
rules &c. 

1462. Raja Radhakant Deva relied upon two verses which he found 
in the Aukhya dskhB of the Tai. S. quoted in the 84th Anuvska of the 
NSrSyanlya Upanisad as the most explicit authority for widow burning ; 
vide Prof. H. H. Wilson's Works vol. II. pp. 293-305. The two so-called 
Vedic texts aro : $ijr araprt g^nrffafir ^^rgnÂ«H# ^gftnnfa <h&&4

except; Visnu contains any reference to sati. The Manusmrti is 
entirely silent about it. It is stated in Strabo ( XV. 1. 30 
and 62 ) that the Greeks under Alexander found sati practised 
among the Cathaei in the Punjab and that that practice arose 
from the apprehension that wives would desert or poison their 
husbands ( Hamilton and Falconer's Translation vol. Ill ). 
The Visnu-dharmasutra 1468 says * On her husband's death the 
widow should observe celibacy or should ascend the funeral 
pyre after him. ' The Mahabharata, though it is profuse in 
the descriptions of sanguinary fights, is very sparing in its 
references to widow burning. Madrl, the favourite wife of 
Pandu, burnt herself with her husband's body. 1484 In the 
Virata-parva Sairandhrl is ordered to be burnt with Klcaka, l465 
just as in ancient times it is said there was a custom to bury 
a slave or slaves along with the deceased ruler. The Mausala 
parva ( 7. 18 ) says that four wives of Vasudeva, viz. DevakI, 
BhadrS,RohinI and Madira burnt themselves with him and (chap. 
7. 73-74) that Rukminl, Gandhftrl, Saibya, HaimavatI, JambavatI 
among the consorts of Krsna burnt themselves along with his 
body and other queens like Satyabhama went to a forest for 
tapas. The Visnupurana also says that eight queens of Krsna, 
Rukminl and others, entered fire on the death of Krsna. 1466 The 
Santiparva ( chap. 148 ) describes how a kapoti ( female pigeon ) 
entered fire on the death of her husband the bird. 1467 In the 
Strlparva ( chap. 26 ) the Great Epic describes the death cere- 
monies performed for the fallen Kauravas, but no mention is 
made of any widow immolating herself on the funeral pyre 
though the chariots, clothes and weapons of the warriors are 
said to have been consigned to fire. From the above it appears

that the practice was originally confined to royal families and 
great warriors even in India and that cases of widow burning 
were rare. Several texts are cited by Apararka from Paithlnasi, 
Angiras, Vyaghrapad which apparently forbid self-immolation 
to brahmana widows. 1468 The authors of digests explain away 
these passages by saying that they only prohibit self-immola- 
tion by a brahmana widow on a funeral pyre different from that 
of the husband i. e. a brahmana widow can burn herself only 
on the funeral pyre of her husband and if his body is cremated 
elsewhere in a foreign land, his widow cannot, on hearing of 
his death, burn herself later. They rely on the text of U6anas 
that a brahmana widow should not follow her husband on a 
separate funeral pyre. The Veda-Vyasa-smrti ( II. 53 ) says that 
a brahmana wife should enter fire, clasping the dead body of 
her husband ; if she lives ( after her husband ) she should give 
up adorning her hair and emaciate her body by austerities. 1469 
In the Ram ay ana, 1470 ( Uttarakanda 17. 15 ) there is a reference 
to the self-immolation of a brahmana woman ( the wife of 
a brahmarsi and mother of VedavatI, who when molested 
by Havana burnt herself in fire ). The Mahabharata ( Sfcrl- 
parva 23. 34 ff. ) on the other hand describes how KrpI, the wife 
of Drona, the brahmana commander-in-chief of the Kauravas, 
appeared with dishevelled hair on the battle-field on the death 
of her husband, but does not say that she burnt herself. 1471 It 
appears therefore that the burning of brahmana widows began 
much later than that of ksatriya widows. 

The burning of a widow on the death of her husband is 
called sahamarav>a or saliagamana or anvarohana ( when she

ascends the funeral pyre of her husband and is burnt along 
with his corpse ), but anumaraya occurs when, after her husband 
is cremated elsewhere and she learns of his death, the widow 
resolves upon death and is burnt with the husband's ashes or 
his padukas ( sandals ) or even without any memento of his 
if none be available ,478 ( vide Apararka p. Ill and Madana- 
parijata p. 198). In the Kumarasambhava ( IV. 34 ) of Kalidasa, 
Rati, the wife of Kama who was burnt by Siva, speaks of 
throwing herself into fire, but is held back by a heavenly voice. 
In the Gathasapta6atl ( VII. 33 ) there is a reference to a woman 
being decked for anumarana (Nirn. ed.). The Kamasutra VI. 3.53 
speaks of anumarana. It has been shown (at p. 579) how Var&ha- 
mihira admires women for their courage in being burnt with 
their husbands. The Harsacarita ( UcchvSsa 5 ) describes how 
Ya6omatI f the chief queen of king Prabhakaravardhana and 
mother of Harsa, consigned herself to fire when the king was 
dying. But this is not a proper case of sati, as she burnt herself 
even before her husband died. In another passage of the 
Harsacarita (V, in the description of night) the glory of 
moon-lotuses is said to be laughing like a woman intent on 
anumarana, who is decked with ear ornaments and wears 
garlands on her head. 1473 Bana in his Kadambarl in a most 
eloquent and well-reasoned passage condemns anumarana. 1474

Rajataranginl cites in several places ( e. g. VI. 107, 195 ; VII. 
103, 478 ) examples of satt. 

In numerous epigraphic records reference is made to the 
practice of satt. Among the earliest is the one in 191 of the 
Gupta era ( 510 A. D. ) in the Gupta Inscriptions ( ed. by Fleet ) 
p. 91. Vide also the Eran posthumous stone pillar Inscription of 
Goparaja which says that his wife accompanied him on the 
funeral pyre when he was killed in battle ; I. A. vol. IX. 
p. 164 ('Nepal Inscription of 705 A. D., where RajyavatI, widow 
of Dharmadeva, bids her son Mahadeva to take up the reins 
of government that she may follow her husband); the Belaturu 
Inscription of saka 979 of the time of Rajendradeva Cola ( E. I. 
vol. VI, p. 213 ) where a siidra woman Dekabbe, on hearing 
of her husband's death, burnt herself in spite of the strong 
opposition of her parents who then erected a stone monument 
to her ; E. I. vol. 14 p. 265, 267 where a grant is made in 
6aka 1103 to a temple by Sinda Mahamandalesvara Racamalla 
on a request by two salts, widows of his general Beciraja ; 
E. I. vol. 20, p. 168 ( of Gedi samvat 919 ) which refers to three 
queens that became satis ; E. I. vol X, p. 39 where the Temara 
gate stone inscription of saka 1246 speaks of MSnikyadevI as 
satl on the death of her husband Amana who was an officer of 
king Hariscandra ; E. I. vol. 20 p. 58 ( Mistra Deoli Inscription 
in Jodhpur when two queens of a Gohila RanS became satis ) ; 
E. I. vol. 16, p. 10, n. 4 and p. 11, n. 2 for satl records of 
6aka 1365 and 1362. In an article on * Satl memorial stones ' 
in J. B. O. R. S. vol. 23, p. 435 fif. it is shown how the memorial 
stones usually bear the figure of the upraised arm and of the sun 
and the moon on either side and a group of stars. Among the 
well-known latest historical examples of satt is that of Ramabal, 
wife of the Peshwa Madhavrao I, in 1772 A. D. The Jauhar 
practised by the Rajput ladies of Chitor and other places 
for saving themselves from unspeakable atrocities at the hands 
of the victorious Moslems are too well-known to need any 
lengthy notice. 

In the Indian Antiquary vol. 35 p. 129 there is a paper on 
1 Satt immolation which is not satt \ where several examples of 
men who killed themselves out of devotion to their masters or 
for other causes are cited and it is pointed out how stone 
monuments ( called mastikkal I e. stone monument for mahasati

in memory of satis and men. The Harsacarita (V. 3rd para from 
end) describes how many of the king's friends, ministers, servants 
and favourites killed themselves on the death of Prabhakaravar- 
dhana. The RajatarahginI VII. 481 narrates how when the queen 
of king Ananta beoame a salt on her husband's death, her litter- 
carrier and some other men and three of her dasis followed her in 
death. There is the example of a mother burning herself on the 
funeral pyre of her son ( vide RajataranginI VII. 1380 ). We 
shall see later on that suicide at holy places like Pray&ga 
was practised for attaining heavenly worlds and bliss. Life 
seems to have been deemed of small account in those ages and 
though the death of women or men on the funeral pyre of the 
husband or for their masters appears to us sophisticated people of 
modern days as very horrible, it did not so appear to the ancients. 
Sail was not in historic times a practice imposed by priests or men 
on unwilling women. It somehow grew and it is improper to say 
that men imposed it on women. It may be that examples of sati 
occurred because of the force of popular sentiment. It was first 
confined to kings and nobles, because the lot of the wives of 
conquered kings and warriors was most miserable in all 
countries as well as in India. Vengeance for the truculence of 
their husbands was wreaked on the poor wives by carrying them 
as captives and making them work as slaves. Manu ( VII. 96 ) 
allows a soldier to retain women ( probably ' slaves * ) conquered 
by him along with other booty. When queen YasomatI narrates 
to her son Harsa the great honour and glory that was hers during 
the reign of her husband king Prabhakaravardhana, she refers to 
the fact that the wives of the enemies defeated by her husband 
waved chowries over her. 1478 From kings the practice spread 
among brahmanas, though as shown above, several smrtikaras 
disapproved of the practice among brahmana wives. Once it 
took root learned commentators and digest writers were found to 
support it with arguments and promises of future rewards. 
Even in modern times we can secure learned writers to support 
any pet theory of a coterie or clique. When Manchester and 
Liverpool were prosperous, English economists preached the 
doctrine of free trade and laissezfaire to all nations, but in more 
difficult times we bave now the apotheosis of Empire Preference

1 he rewards promised to a sail were as follows: Sankha 
and Angiras im say * she who follows her husband in death 
dwells in heaven for as many years as there are hair on the 
human body, viz. 3Â£ crores of years. Just as a snake-catcher 
draws out a snake from a hole by force, so such a woman draws 
her husband from ( wherever he may be ) and enjoys bliss 
together with him. In heaven she being solely devoted to her 
husband and praised by bevies of heavenly damsels sports with 
her husband for as long as fourteen Indras rule. Even if the 
husband be guilty of the murder of a brahmana or of a friend or 
be guilty of ingratitude, the wife w ho dies ( in fire ) clasping 
his body, purifies him ( of the sin ). That woman, who ascends 
( the funeral pyre ) when the husband dies, is equal to 
ArundhatI in her character and is praised in heaven. As long as 
a woman does not burn herself in fire on the death of her hus- 
band she is never free from being born as a woman ( in succes- 
sive births)'. Harlfca says ' that woman who follows her husband 
in death purifies three families, viz. of her mother, of her father 
and of her husband \ The Mit. after quoting the above 
passages adds that this duty of anvarohana is common to 
the women of all castes from the brahmana to the candala, 
provided they are not pregnant or they have no young children 
( at the husband's death ) V 478 

There were old commentators who were opposed to the 
practice of sati. Medhatithi on Manu V. 157 ( Kamam tu &c. ) 
compares this practice to iyenayUga which a man performed by

way of black magic to kill his enemy. He says ,m that though 
Angiras allowed ' anumarana ' it is suicide and is really 
forbidden to women. Just as the Veda says ' syenenabhicaran 
yajet ' and yet syenayaga is not looked upon as dharma, but 
rather as adbaruia ( vide Sahara on Jaimini 1. 1. 2 ), so, though 
Angiras speaks of it, it is really adharma ; and that a woman 
who is in a hurry and extremely anxious to secure heaven 
quickly for herself and her husband might act according to 
Angiras, still her action is a$astriya ( not in accordance with 
the sastras ) ; besides anvarohana is opposed to the Vedic text 
1 one should not leave this world before one has finished one's 
allotted span of life V The Mit. on Yaj. L 86 oombats these 
arguments. It says that syenayaga is no doubt undesirable 
and therefore adharma, but that is so because the object of 
syenayaga is injury to another. Anugamana on the other hand 
is not bo ; there the result promised is heaven which is a desir- 
able result and which is enjoined by iruti in such sentences as 
' one should sacrifice a white goat to Vayu if one desires pros- 
perity \ Similarly the smrti about anugamana is not opposed 
to the iruti quoted, the meaning of which is different ; that sruti 
means ' one should not waste one's life for securing heavenly 
bliss which is fleeting and insignificant as compared with the 
supreme bliss of Brahma knowledge'. As the woman in 
anumarana desires only heaven, she is not doing anything cont- 
rary to the sruti texts. This is the reasoning of the Mitaksara 
which looks like special pleading. Apararka p. Ill, the Madana- 
parijata p. 199, Par. M. II. part I pp. 55-56 follow the reasoning 
of the Mit. and add that the Vedic text about the allotted span 
of life is a general rule, while the smrti about anumarana is a 
special or exceptional sastra and so there is no contradiction 
as the rule applies to all cases outside the excepted one. The 
Madanaparijata ( p. 200 ) further explains that the texts about 
purifying a husband guilty of brahmana murder are not to be 
taken literally but only as hyperbolically extolling anvarohana.

The Sm. C. also expreesly says that anvarohana, 1480 though re- 
commended by the Visnu Dh. S. ( 25. 14 ) and Angiras, is 
inferior to brahmacarya (leading a celibate life), since the 
rewards of anvarohana are inferior to those of brahmacarya. 
As against this may be cited the extreme view of Angiras ' for 
all women there is no other duty except falling into the funeral 
pyre, when the husband dies. ,]481 The Suddhitattva remarks 
that this extreme or sweeping statement is made by way of 
belauding sahamarana. 

We saw above that brahmana widows were only allowed 
anvarohana, but not anumarana. There were other restrictions 
enjoined by the smrtis on all widows ' wives who have a child 
of tender years, who are pregnant, who have not attained 
puberty and who are in their monthly course do not mount the 
funeral pyre of their husbands' 1488 â from the Brhan-Naradlya 
purana. There is a similar verse of Brhaspati. The wife who 
was in her course was allowed to burn herself after she bathed 
on the fourth day. 

Apastamba ( verse ) prescribes the Prajapatya penance 
for a woman who having first resolved to burn herself on the 
funeral pyre turns back from it at the last moment. I485 The 
RajataranginI (VI. 196) refers to a queen who having pretended 
to have resolved on becoming sati ultimately regretted the step 
and turned back. 

The Suddhitattva sets out the procedure of widow burning. 1484 
The widow bathes and puts on two white garments, takes ku6a 
blades in her hands, faces the east or north, performs acamana (sip- 
ping water) ; when the brahrnanas say 'om, tat sat' she remembers 
the God Narayana and refers to the time ( month, fortnight,

tithi ) and then makes the samkalpa (^declaration of resolve ) 
set out below. She then calls upon the eight lokapalas (guardians 
of the quarters ), the sun, the moon, the fire &c. to become 
witnesses to her act of following her husband on the funeral 
pyre, she then goes round the fire thrice, then the brahmana 
recites the Vedic verse ' ima narlr &c.' ( Rg. X. 18. 7 ) and a 
Purana verse ' may these very good and holy women who are 
devoted to their husbands enter fire together with the body of 
the husband/ the woman utters * namo namah * and ascends the 
kindled pyre. The long-winded preamble of the samkalpa 
*arundhatl...patiputatvakfima' is based upon the verses of Angiras 
quoted above (in n. 1477). The Suddhitattva as printed is corrupt 
but it appears that it read the last quarter of Rg. X. 18. 7 as 
'firohantu jalayonim-agne ' ( let them ascend the watery seat or 
origin, O fire ! ) meaning probably ' may fire be to them as cool as 
water'. Some writers have charged the brahmana priest-hood 
( or Raghunandana ) with having purposely changed the 
reading of the verse Rg. X. 18. 7 in order to make it suit the 
rite of immolating oneself in fire ( i. e. * agne ' or * agneh ' was 
substituted for * agre ' ). But this charge is not sustainable. That 
the verse Rg. X. 18. 7 as it actually is was held to refer to 
widow burning centuries before Raghunandana follows from the 
fact that even the Brahmapurana 14W and Apararka ( quoted 
above on p. 628 ) take it in that sense. It was therefore not 
necessary to alter the reading. Further even if some priests or 
Raghunandana had changed it that fact would have been 
detected in no time, as in those days there were thousands of 
people who knew every syllable of the Rgveda by heart. There- 
fore it must be admitted that either the M SS. are corrupt or Raghu- 
nandana committed an innocent slip. That mantra was not 
addressed to widows at all, but to ladies of the deceased man's 
household whose husbands were living and the grhyasutra of 
Asv. made use of it with that meaning. Raghunandana, a 
profound student of dharmasastras and smrtis (and often 
styled Smarta-bhattacarya), could not have been ignorant of 
what As v. said. The procedure as prescribed in the Nirnaya- 
sindhu 1486 of Kamalakarabhat^a, whose mother became a sati

and who pays a very tender and touching reverence to her 
memory in his works, is somewhat different and it is- followed 
by the Dharmasindhu. 

It appears from all accounts of travellers and others that 
widow-burning prevailed more in Bengal during the centuries 
immediately preceding its abolition than anywhere else in 
India. 1487 If that was so, there were certain good reasons for 
that state of things. In the whole of India, except Bengal, the 
widows of members in a joint Hindu family are only entitled to 
maintenance and have no other rights over the property of the 
family. In Bengal, wherever the Dayabhaga prevails, the 
widow of a sonless member even in a joint Hindu family is 
entitled to practically the same rights over joint family 
property which her deceased husband would have had. This 
must have frequently induced the surviving 1488 members to get 
rid of the widow by appealing at a most distressing hour to her 
devotion to and love for her husband. This rule of the widow's 
right was not for the first time propounded by Jlmutarahana ; 
he makes it clear that he followed a predecessor called Jiten- 
driya. The figures given above lend support to the view 
expressed here, since Benares, where the rights of widows were 
insignificant, was responsible for a small number of satis only. 
It is impossible, however, to believe that the number of widows 
in ordinary stations of life burning themselves was very large 
at any time or that most of the widows that did so were 
coerced into doing it. There is a good deal of epigraphic and 
other evidence particularly in other parts of India that rela- 
tives tried to dissuade the widow from taking the step. 
Even in Bengal the number of satis must never have been very 

1487. Thomson in his book on 'Suttee' (pp. 69,72) gives the figures 
for satis reported fiom the Bengal Presidency (which then included 
Bihar and extended up io Benares) during 1815-1828. The lowest 
fignre was 378 in 1815 and the highest 839 in 1818. Out of the total of 
2366 cases during the four years 1815-1818, the Calcutta division alone 
contributed 1485, the Benares division, the seat of orthodoxy, contri- 
buted only 343. Vide H. H. Wilson's history of India ' (ed. of 1858), 
vol. Ill (for 1805-1835 A. 1). ), pp 185-192. At p. 189 a table of the 
number of satis for 1815-1828 is given, from which it appears that in 
1828 there were 463 cases of satis out of whorn 420 came from Bengal, 
Bihar and Orissa, out of which 287 were from the Calcutta division alone.

large. Colebrooke, who had spent the best part of his life in 
Bengal and who was a profound Sanskrit scholar, observes in a 
paper written about 1795 A. D. 4 Happily the martyrs of this 
superstition have never been numerous. It is certain that the 
instances of the widow's sacrifices are now rare'. 1489 The very 
fact that there was no disturbance of peace or ebullition of 
popular feeling or even any great verbal protest from the vast 
Hindu population ( except a petition to the Privy Council ) 
against Bentinck's sweeping measure indicates two things, 
viz. that the burning of widows was a rare occurrence and 
that people were not very keen on observing the practice 
nor had they any very deep-seated convictions about its 
absolute religious necessity. 1490 

Modern India does not justify the practice of sati, but it is 
a warped mentality that rebukes modern Indians for expressing 
admiration and reverence for the cool and unfaltering courage 
of Indian women in becoming satis or performing the jauhar 
for cherishing their ideals of womanly conduct. If Englishmen 
can feel pride in their ancestors who grabbed one fourth of the 
world's surface or if Frenchmen can feel pride in the deeds of 
their Emperor Napoleon who tried to enslave the whole of Europe 
and yet are not held up to ridicule or rebuke, there is no reason 
why poor Indians cannot express admiration for the sacrifices 
which their women made in the past, though they may 
condemn the institution itself which demanded such terrible 
sacrifice and suffering.

violent resistance to Bentinck's measure were singularly falsified. 



CHAPTER XVI 

VESYA 

Veiya â ( Courtezan ). This work dealing among other 
matters with the position of women and marriage in India 
would be incomplete if nothing were said about prostitutes and 
concubines. Prostitution has existed from the dawn of history in 
all countries and in the absence of statistics it is difficult to say 
whether it flourished more in one country than in another or 
whether it existed to a greater or lesser extent in ancient days as 
compared with modern times. The article in the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica on prostitution will be an eye-opener to many who 
will be inclined to turn their nose at Indian conditions. 

From the Rgveda we find that there were women who were 
common to several men i. e. who were courtezans or prostitutes. 
In Rg. I. 167. 4 the bright Maruts ( storm gods ) are said to have 
become associated with the young ( lightning ), just as men 
become associated with a young courtezan. 1591 It has already 
been seen how in Rg. II. 29. 1 reference is made to a woman who 
gives birth in secret to a child and leaves it aside. In Rg. I, 
66. 4 $ I. 117. 18, 1. 134. 3 and other places jam ( paramour or 
secret lover ) is spoken of. In Gaut. XXII. 27 it is said that 
for killing a woman who is a brahmanl by birth only and who 
subsists by harlotry no prayascitta is necessary but eight hand- 
fuls of corn may be gifted. Manu IV. 209 forbids a brahmana 
from taking food offered by harlots ( vide also IV. 219 ) ; and 
Manu IX. 259 requires the king to punish clever ( or deceitful ) 
harlots. In the Mahabharata courtezans are an established 
institution. The Adiparva (115. 39) narrates how a vesya 
waited upon Dhrtarastyra when his wife Gandharl was 
pregnant. 149 * In the Udyogaparva ( 30. 38) Yudhisthira sends 
greetings to the vesyas of the Kauravas. Courtezans are describ- 
ed as going out to welcome Krsna when he came on a mission 
of peace to the Kaurava court ( Udyoga 86. 15 ). When the 
Pandava armies are described as about to start for battle it

is said that carts, markets and courtezans also accompanied them 
( Udyoga 151. 58 ). Vide also Vanaparva 239. 37, Karnaparva 
94. 26. Yaj. im II. 290 divides concubines into two sorts, 
avaruddha ( one who is kept in the house itself and forbidden to 
have intercourse with any other male ) and bhujisya ( concubine 
who is not kept in the house, but elsewhere and is in the 
special keeping of a person ) and prescribes a fine of fifty panas 
against another person having intercourse with them. Narada ,494 
( strlpumsa, 78-79 ) says ' intercourse is permitted with wanton 
women ( svairinl ) who are not brahmana by caste, with a 
prostitute, a female slave, or a female not restrained by her 
master, if these belong to a caste lower than oneself ; but it is 
forbidden with women of superior caste. But when these very 
women are the kept mistresses ( of a person ) intercourse with 
them by a stranger is as much a crime as intercourse with 
another's wife. Such women must not be approached, though 
intercourse with them is not forbidden ( on the ground of caste 
&c ), since they belong to another.' On Yaj. II, 290 the Mit., after 
quoting the Skandapurana to the effect that prostitutes constitute 
a separate caste being sprung from certain Apsarases ( heavenly 
nymphs ) called paftcacutfas, states that such courtezans as are not 
kept specially by a person do not incur any sin, nor punishment 
at the hands of the king, if they have intercourse with men of the 
same or a superior caste, nor do men approaching them incur any 
penalty if they are not avaruddha. But the men who visit them 
incur sin ( which is an unseen result ), since the smrtis ordain 
that men should be devoted to their wives ( vide Yaj. I. 81 ) and 
the prajapatya penance is prescribed for him who has intercourse 
with a veiyd (vide Atri v. 271). Narada 1495 (vetanasyanapSkarma 
18 ) lays down that if a public woman after getting her fee 
refuses to receive the customer, she shall pay twice the amount 
of the fee and the same fine shall be imposed on a man who does 
not pay the ( stipulated ) fee, after having had intercourse with 
a veiya. Vide Yaj. II. 292 and Matsyapurana 227. 144-145 for

similar provisions. The MatsyapurSna chap. 70 dilates upon 
vesyadharma. The Kamasutra I. 3. 20 defines a garilka as a 
veiya who is most accomplished and proficient in the 64 kolas, 
Apararka ( p. 800, on Yaj. II. 198 ) quotes NSrada ( cited above ) 
and several verses of the Matsyapurana about vesyas. , 

Concubines being recognized by society, the smrtis provided 
for their maintenance. During the life-time of a person keeping 
a concubine, the latter has no legal right to proceed against tbe 
former. Narada ( dayabhaga UM 52 ) and Katyayana lay down 
that even when the property of a deceased person escheats to 
the king for want of heirs ( except in the case of the deceased 
being a brahraana ) the king has first to provide for the main- 
tenance of the concubines of the deceased, of his slaves and for 
his sraddhas. The Mit. says that the concubines here referred 
to are those called avaruddha ( and not bhujisya ) and that 
even the kept mistresses of a deceased brahmana are entitled to 
maintenance from his property. The Privy Council in Bai 
Nagubai v. Bai Mcmghibai have gone beyond the Mit. and have 
held that all concubines ( whether kept in the house practically 
as members of the family i. e. avaruddha or not so kept i. e. 
bhujisya ) within the exclusive keeping of a Hindu till his 
death are entitled to maintenance from his property after his 
death, provided they are continuously chaste thereafter. im 

The rights of the illegitimate children of concubines tc 
inheritance or maintenance will be dealt with later on undei 
inheritance. 

Out of the samskSras enumerated above ( pp. 195-197 ), tbe 
Mahayajnas, Utsarjana and Upakarma will be described under

CHAPTER XVII 

AHNIKA AND ACARA 

( Daily and periodical duties and ceremonies ) 

This forms a very important topic of dharmasastra. The 
daily duties of the brahmacarin have been already described 
above and those of the vanaprastha and yati will be spoken of 
later on. Under this section we are concerned principally with 
the duties of the snataka ( the would-be householder ) and the 
grhastha ( the householder ). 

Before the ahnika duties are described a few remarks about 
the importance of the stage of householder would not be out of 
place. It has already been shown (pp. 424-425) how one school of 
dharmasastra writers represented by Gautama and Baudhayana 
looked upon the stage of householder as the only asrama. The 
eulogies of the householder are sung in numerous passages of the 
Dharmasastra works. Gaufc. U98 ( III. 3 ) declares that the house- 
holder is the source ( support ) of all the other asramas, because 
the other three do not produce offspring. Manu ( III. '77-78 ) 
states that as all creatures live by receiving support from the 
air, so other asramas subsist by relying for support on the 
householder and that as men belonging to all the three other 
orders ( asramas ) are supported from day to day by the house- 
holder alone with ( gifts of ) food and sacred knowledge, the 
householder's is therefore the most excellent asrama. Manu 
( VI. 89-90 ) reiterates the same sentiments under a different 
figure * just as all big and small rivers find a resting place in 
the ocean, so men of all asramas find support in the householder 
and the householder is declared to be the most excellent of all 
the asramas by the precepts of the Veda and smrbis, since he 
supports the other three \ Visnu Dh. S. ( 59. 27-29 ) contains 
almost the same remarks as Manu. Vide Vas. VIII. 14-16 ( 15 
being identical with Manu VI. ( . ). Vas. VII. 17 ( and X. 31 ), 
Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 1, Udyogaparva 40. 25 say that a house- 
holder observing the rules laid down for him does not fall

away from the world of Brahma. ,499 In the Mahabharata 
also the eulogy of the order of householder is frequent. 
Santiparva 296. 39 is the same as Manu VI. 90. Santi 
270. 6-7 states 'as all beings live on the support given by 
their mothers, so other asramas subsist on the support of the 
order of householders'. 1500 In thesame chapter ( verses 10-11 ) 
Kapila condemns those who hold that moksa ( final release from 
sarhsara ) is not possible for him who remains a householder. 
Santi 12. 12 holds that, if weighed in the balance, the order 
of householders is equal to all the other three put together. 
Vide also Santi 11. 15, 23. 2-5, Vanaparva. cha#^#. The 
Ayodhyakanda 106. 22 also says that the stage of householder 
is the most excellent of all asramas. 

The brahmana householder is again divided into several 
varieties from different points of view. Baud. Dh. S. III. 1. 1, 
Devala ( quoted in the Mit. on Yaj. I. 128 ) and other works 
divide a householder into two varieties viz. sallna and yaya- 
vara, 1501 the latter being superior to the former. 1502 The sallna

642 History of DharmaiUstra [ Ch. XVII 

is one who dwells in a house, is possessed of servants and 
cattle, lias a fixed plaoe and a fired village and has grain and 
wealth and follows the life of worldly people; the yayavara is 
one who subsists by the best of livelihood, viz. picking up 
grains that fall down when the corn that is reaped is taken to 
the house or threshing floor by the owner and who does not 
accumulate wealth or who does not earn his livelihood by 
officiating as priest, or by teaching or by accepting gifts, 
Manu (IV. 7) appears to divide brahmana householders into 
four varieties, viz. one who possesses enough to fill a granary 
or a store filling a corn jar, one who collects as much as will 
satisfy his needs for*three days, or one who makes no provision 
for the morrow. Vide Santiparva 244. 1-4 and Laghu-Visnu II. 17 
for similar statements. The Mit on Yaj. I. 128 says that * sallna 
is of four varieties viz. (1) one who maintains himself by 
officiating as a priest, teaching Veda, accepting gifts, 
agriculture, trade and breeding cattle, (2) one who subsists by 
the first three out of the above six, (3) one who subsists by 
officiating as a priest and by teaching, (4) one who subsists by 
teaching alone. Manu IV. 9 ( as interpreted by the Mit. ) refers 
to these four varieties. The Ap. Sr, ( V. 3. 22 ) distinguishes 
between sallna and yayavara, 150 * The Baud. gr. III. 5. 4 refers 
to yayavara. The word * ySyavara ' occurs in the Tai. S. V. 2. 
1. 7 l504 * therefore the active man lords it over one who is easy- 
going ' ; but here the word has not probably any technical sense. 

In the Vaik. VIII. 5 150S (=Vaik. Dh. S. I. 5 ) householders 
are divided into four classes. The first class ( called vart&vrtti )

maintains itself by agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade ; the 
second ( sallna ) observes various nhjamas ( vide Yaj. III. 313 ), 
offers pakayajfias (sacrifices of cooked food), kindles the 
srauta fires, offers the daisa and purnamasa sacrifices each half 
month, offers caturmasyas, in each half year offers an animal 
sacrifice and each year the soma sacrifice ; the third ( yayavara ) 
is engaged in the six actions viz. offering sacrifices of havis and 
soma, officiating as priest at such sacrifices, studying the Veda 
and teaching it, making gifts and receiving them, constantly 
attends his fires ( srauta and smarta ), and gives food to guests- 
that come to him ; the fourth ( called ghoracarika, one whose 
rules are awfully difficult to observe ) is observant of nhjamas, 
offers sacrifices but does not officiate at others' sacrifices, studies 
the Veda but does not teach it, makes gifts but does not receive 
them, maintains himself on corn fallen in the fields &c, is 
absorbed in Narayana, performs agnihotra in the morning and 
evening, in Margaslrsa and Jyestha performs observances that 
are like the edge of a sword and attends upon his fires with herbs 
from a forest. These four names occur also in Brhat-Parasara 
p. 290 ( Jivananda's ed. ). 

In numerous smrfcis, puranas and digests the duties of 
householders have been described in detail. For example, vide 
Gaut. V and IX, Ap. Dh, S. II. 1. l-II. 4. 9, Vas. Dh. S. 
VIII. 1-17 and XI. 1-48, Manu IV, Yaj. I. 96-127, Visnu 
Dh. S. 60-71, Daksa II, Vedavyasa III, Markandeya-purana 
29-30 and 34, Nrsimha-purana 58. 45-106, Kurmapurana 
( uttarardha chap. 15-16 ), Laghu-Harita IV. p. 183 ff ( Jiva- 
nanda ), Dronaparva 82, Vanaparva 2. 53-63, Asvamedhika 45. 
16-25, Anusasana-parva 97. Among the digests may be men- 
tioned the Sm. 0. (I. pp. 88-232), the Smrtyarthaeara (pp. 18-48), 
the Madanaparijata ( pp. 204-345 ), the Grhasfcharatnakara, the 
Ahnikatattva of Raghunandana, the Vlramitrodaya ( Ahnika- 
prakasa ), the Smrtimuktaphala ( Ahnikakanda ). It would be 
impossible to present in the space at our disposal all the 
details of the duties of the householder contained in the 
vast sources indicated above. Some of the usual, out- 
standing or important matters alone can be dealt with 
here. Some of the works contain moral exhortations to the 
householder. For example, the Anusasanaparva 1508 ( 141. 25-26 )

says 'ahimsS, truthfulness, compassion towards all beings, 
quiescence, charity according to one's ability â this is the best 
dharma for a grhastba ( householder ). Non-contact with the 
wives of others, guarding one's wife and deposit ( made by 
another), abstaining from taking what is not given (by the 
owner), avoiding honey and meatâ this five-fold dharma has 
many branches and gives rise to happiness. ' Daksa ( II. 66-67 ) 
also has similar provisions. But such moral exhortations 
(called sadharana dharmas) have already been discussed above 
( pp. 3-11 ). 

From very ancient times there were several ways 
of dividing the day. Sometimes the word ' ahah * is 
distinguished from night and sometimes it stands for 
the period from sunrise to sunrise ( and includes day 
and night ). For example, in Rg. VI. 9. 1 we have 1507 the dark 
day ( i. e. night ) and the bright day ( i. e. the period when 
there is light ). This part ( viz. the period of sunlight ) 
is divided some times into two parts viz. purvahna ( period before 
noon ) and aparahna ( the time after noon ) Vide Rg. X. 34. 11, 
Manu III. 278. Day time is also divided into three parts, 
morning, midday and evening, which correspond to the three 
libations of Soma juice in pratahsavana, madhyandina-savana 
and trfclya-savana. Vide Rg. III. 53. 8 where these three parts of 
the day are mentioned when Indra comes to drink Soma for a 
muhurta each time and III. 28. 1, 4 and 5 ( where all three 
savanas are named ) and III. 32. 1, III. 52. 5-6. The day ( of 
12 hours ) was often divided into five parts, 1508 viz. pratah or 
udaya (sunrise ), satrigava, madhyandina or madhyahna (mid-day), 
aparahna ( afternoon ) and sayahna or astagamana or sayam 
( evening ). Each of these five parts of day time will be 
equal to three muhurtas. In some smrtis and puranas these 
five parts are mentioned and defined ; e. g. in the Prajapatismrti,

170-174. Vide Apararka p. 465 ( on Yaj. I. 226 ) where a 
irufi passage and verses from Vyasa are quoted about these five 
parts. ,509 The whole day of twenty-four hours was divided into 
thirty muhurtas ; vide Sat. Br. XII. 3. 2. 5, S. B. E. vol. 44, 
p. 169 where the year is said to have 10800 muhurtas (360x30). 
The Tai. Br. III. 10. 1 gives the names of the fifteen muhurtas 
of day-time, such as Citra, Ketu &o. 

The Madanaparijata p. 496 quotes Vyasa for the fifteen 
parts of the day. 

The smrtis however generally divide day-time into eight 
parts. Daksa II. 4-5 divides the day into eight parts and then 
treats at length about the duties to be performed during those 
eight parts. Katyayana divides day-time into eight parts and 
asks the king to assign three parts after the first to the investi- 
gation of judicial proceedings. 1510 That this was a very 
ancient division follows from several considerations. Kau- 
tilya 1511 divides the day and night each into eight parts and 
prescribes what the king is to do in the eight parts of the day 
and also in the eight parts of the night. Vas. XI. 36, Laghu- 
Harlta 99, Laghu-Satatapa v. 108 say 'the sun becomes 
mild-rayed in the 8th part of the day and that time is called 
kutapa V 518 The Kadambarl of Bana ( para 24 ) speaks of the 
light of the sun becoming clear and bright in the first eighth part 
of the day. 1513 In the MahabhSrata frequent reference is made 
to the sixth part of the day as a somewhat late hour for taking 
one's meal ( and as making one hungry ). Vide Vanaparva

646 History of Dharmaiasfra [ Ch. XVII 

The principal matters to be discussed under ahnilca are : 
getting up from bed, sauca ( bodily purity ), dantadhftvana 
( brushing the teeth ), snana ( bath ), samdhya, tarpana, the five 
maJiayajfias ( including brahmayajna and honouring guests ), 
attending on fire, bhojana ( mid-day meal ), obtaining wealth, 
studying and teaching, evening sarhdhya, gift?, going to bed, 
performing sacrifices at certain stated times. The Parasara 
smrti I. 39 summarises the most important daily duties as 
bathing, performing the sarhdhya prayers, japa, homa, worship 
of gods and honouring of guests, and vaisvadeva are the six 
(principal) daily actions. 1515 Manu (IV. 152=Anusasana 
parva 104. 23 ) also enumerates in one place the principal daily 
actions that must be got through in the morning viz. answering 
calls of nature, toilet, bathing, brushing the teeth, applying 
collyriuin to the eyes and worship of the gods 1516 . 

Although a3 stated in the Suryasiddhanta 1517 the day was 
calculated from sunrise, daytime for practical purposes 
was extended for a short time before sunrise and after sunrise. 
According to the Brahmavaivarta-pur&na the four nadis ( or 
ghatikas) before sunrise and the four nadis after sunset are 
included in daytime ( dina ) i. e. when a man takes his bath 
before sunrise on a particular day that bath is one for the day 
that is to begin after he takes his bath ,518 . Several smrfcis like 
Manu IV. 92, Yaj. L 115 enjoin that a man should get up from 
bed at the brahma muhurta, 1519 should reflect over dharma and 
artha that he would seek to attain that day and over the bodily 
efforts that he would have to undergo for securing his object 
and think out the real meaning of Vedic injunctions. Kulluka 
and others say that the word muhurta in Manu IV. 92 means

only time generally and nod a period of two ghatfkSs and that 
ifc is called brahma because that; is a time when one's intelli- 
gence and one's power to compose a literary work are at their 
best. The Par. M. ( 1. 1. p. 220 ) 182 Â° says that there are two 
muhurtas in the half watch before sunrise, the first of the two is 
called brahma and the second raudra. Pitamaha quoted in the 
Sm. C. ( I. p. 88 ) says that the last watch of the night is called 
* brahma muhurta \ From very early times getting up before 
sunrise was prescribed specially for a student and generally for 
everyone. Gaut. 23. 21 says that if the sun rose while a 
brahmacarin was asleep he should stand up the whole day 
without food and mutter the Gayatrl throughout the day ( as a 
penance ) and if the sun set while he was asleep he should sit 
up the whole night engaged in muttering the Gayatrl. Ap. Dh. 
S. II 5. 12. 13-14 and Manu II. 220-221 contain similar rules 
and they employ the word * abhinirmukta 152! ( or abhinimrukta ) 
to denote one who is asleep when the sun sets. The Gobhila- 
start i ( in verse ) 1. 139 says that on getting up one should wash 
one's eyes. In the Rgvidhana it is ordained that on getting up 
one should wipe one's eyes with water after reciting Rg. X. 73. 
11 the latter half of which says ' remove away from us dark- 
ness, fulfil our eyes and release us who are as if bound with 
snares \ 

The Sm. C. ( I. p. 88 ) quotes the Kurmapurana to the effect 
that on getting up from sleep some time before sunrise one 
should contemplate on God. The Ahnika-prakasa (p. 16 ) 
quotes five verses from the Vamanapurana (14. 23-27) which are 
to be recited on getting up as a morning hymn, one of which is 
quoted below. 1522 These verses are repeated even now by some

old people. Some works say that he who repeats the four verses 
called Bharatasavitrl in the morning obtains the reward of hearing 
the whole Mahabharata and attains the highest Brahma. 1523 The 
Ahnikatattva(p. 327) quotes a verse to be repeated on getting up 
from bed in which the serpent Karkotaka, Damayanti, kings Nala 
and Rtuparna are remembered for removing the effects of Kali, 1524 
and the Srartimuktaphala quotes a verse about Nala, Yudhi- 
sthira, Sita and Krsna as punyasloka ( singing of whose glory is 
holy) 1525 . The Acararatna (p. 10 a) states that one should 
repeat the names of certain famous and long-lived (cirajlvins) 
personages viz. ASvatthaman, Bali, Vyasa, Hanuman, Bibhl- 
sana, Kcpa, Para^urama and Markandeya and also the names 
of five holy women, Ahalya, DraupadI, Sita, Tara and Mando- 
darl. Even now old men brought up in the orthodox ways 
repeat these names on getting up. 

In some works it is said that if on getting up a man sees a 
brahmana learned in the Veda, a lady whose husband is living, 
a cow, an altar where fire is kindled, he becomes free from 
adversities and that if a man sees on getting up in the morning 
a very sinful man, a widow, an untouchable, one naked, one 
whose nose is cut off, that is an indication of kali ( misfortune 
or strife ). 1526 Para&ara XII. 47 says that one who has built 
the fire altar ( for Vedic sacrifices ), a dark-brown cow, one 
who is engaged in a sattra (or performed it), the king, an ascetic, 
the ocean â these purify a man the moment they are seen, so 
one should see them always. 

Then the next act is to answer the calls of nature. Very 
detailed rules are laid down about these even in the most 
ancient sutras and smrtis. Many of the rules are simply 
hygienic, but as religion, rules of law, of morality, of health and

hygiene are mixed up in the ancient works, they are given in 
works on dharma. Even in the Atharvaveda (XIII. 1. 56) 
it 1517 is said * I cut off thy root who kick a cow with the foot 
or who urinate opposite the sun (facing the sun); thou shall 
not further cast a shadow. ' Urinating while standing seemg 
to have been condemned in the time of the Atharvaveda ; vide 
VII. 102 ( 107 ). 1 'I shall urinate standing erect ; let not the 
lords harm me. â¢ Gaut. IX. 13, 15, 37-43, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 
15-30 and I. 11. 31. 1-3, Vas. Dh. S. VI. 10-19 and XII. 11-13, 
Manu IV. 45-53, 56, 151, Yaj. I. 16-17, 134, 154, Visnu Dh. S. 
60. 1-26, Sankha, 1528 Vayupuraria 78. 59-64 and 79. 25-31, 
Vamanapurana 14. 30-32 may be summarised as follows : one 
should not void urine or ordure on the road, on ashes, on cow- 
dung, in ploughed or sown fields, under the shade of trees, in 
rivers or water, on grassy or beautiful spots, on bricks made 
ready for erecting altars, on mountain-tops, near dilapidated 
shrines or cowpens, on ant-hills, in cemeteries or in holes, on 
threshing floors, on sandy shores. Nor should one answer 
calls of nature looking at or facing fire, the sun, the moon, a 
brahmana, water, the image of some god, cow, wind. Nor should 
one do these acts on the bare ground, but on ground covered 
with dry twigs or leaves or grass or loose earfch. One should 
cover one's head and should face the north by day or when there 
is twilight and face the south at night, but when there 
is a danger one may face any direction. One should not 
urinate while standing or walking ( Manu. IV. 47 ) nor should 
one speak while doing so. 1529 One should answer oalls of nature 
away from a human habitation towards the south or south- 
west. Manu V. 126 and Yaj. I. 17 prescribe that, after 
answering calls of nature, one should perform cleansing the 
parts with water held in a pot and lumps of earfch to such an 
extent that no smell or filth will stick. According to Manu 
V. 136 and 137 and Visnu Dh. S. 60. 25-26 one lump of earth is 
to be applied to the penis, three to the arms, ten to the left hand

and seven to both hands, three to both feet together. This is 
the extent of iauca required for householders, and for brabma- 
carin, forest hermit and sarhnyasin, twice, thrio8 and four times 
as much is required. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 17 remarks that for 
all asramas the cleansing required is only as much as will 
remove foul smell and filth and the several numbers of lumps 
of earth prescribed in different smrtis are only precribed for 
unseen ( or spiritual ) results. Gaut. I. 45-46, Vae. III. 48 and 
Manu V. 134 say that cleansing of the body is to be so effected 
first with water and then with earth that foul smell and filth 
will be totally removed. Devala ( quoted in the Gr. R. p. 147 ) 
says tbat respectable people do not emphasize the number of 
times mentioned in the smrtis, but they say that cleansing 
should be carried on till one feels that it is all right. 15S0 
The Smrtyarthasara 15?l ( p. 19 ) following Daksa V. 12 says 
that at night only half of the sauca prescribed for the day 
is required, only one-fourth of it is prescribed for the 
ailing and only one-eighth when a man is on a journey 
and that no special number of lumps of earth are prescribed for 
women, sudras, boys whose upanayana has not been performed. 
In cleansing one is not to employ stones, clods of earth, and 
green twigs cut off for the purpose from herbs and trees ( Ap. 
Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 30, Gaut. IX. 15 ) nor is one to use earth from 
inside a river or water reservoir or from a temple, from an 
ant-hill or from the hiding places of rats or from dung-hills or 
what is left after being used for a prior cleansing ( Vas. Dh. S. 
VI. 17 ) nor what is taken from a road or cemetery, nor should 
one use earth that has worms, coals, or bones or gravel in it. 
Daksa V. 7 prescribes that for the first time as much earth as 
will fill half of the outstretched hand and for the second time 
half of that is to be taken and so on. 1522 The lump of earth 
should not be bigger than a myrobalan fruit ( Kurmapurana in 
Sm. C. I. p. 182 ). One is not to answer calls of nature with the 
shoes on ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 18 ) and one's yajflopavita should 
be suspended from the right ear or he should throw it on his

back in the nivlta form. 1583 According to Yaj. 1. 16 the yajfiopavita 
should be suspended from the right ear only. Vanaparva 59. 2 
describes that kali (the principle of evil and strife) entered 
Nala when the latter did not wash his feet after urinating. 

This cleansing of the body in the morning is only a part 
of general iauca. Sauca is according to Gaut. VIII. 24 one of the 
atmagunas. Even the Rg. ( in VII. 56. 12 and other verses ) 
appears to emphasize cleanliness ( sucitva). 1554 According to 
Harlta * sauca is the first path to dharma, it is the resting place 
of brahraa ( Veda ), the abode of srl ( prosperity ), the means of 
clearing ( or soothing ) the mind, the favourite of gods, the 
means of realizing the Atman and the awakener of intelli- 
gence. ' ,5 * 5 According to Baud. Dh. S. III. 1. 26, Harlta, Daksa 
V. 3 and Vyaghrapada (quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 93) sauca is of two 
kinds, 1538 bahya (outward) and antara or abhyantara (inward), the 
first being effected by water and loose earth and the latter is the 
purity of one's sentiments. Harlta divides the first into three, 
that of kula ( being free from impurity due to birth or death in 
the family ), of artha ( i. e. of the vessels and things to be used 
in all matters ) and of iarira ( cf one's body ); Harlta divides 
abhyantara into five, manasa ( mental ), caksusa ( of the eye i. e. 
not looking at things that should not be looked at ), ghranya 
( of the nose ), vacya ( of speech ), svadya ( of the tongue ). 
According to a verse quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 24 
sauca is of four kinds, viz. of dravya ( the vessels and things 
employed by one), of the mind, of speech and of the body. 
Vrddha-Gautama ( JivSnanda p. 632 ) speaks of five kinds of 
sauca viz. of the mind, of actions, of kula ( family ), of the body 
and of speech. According to Manu V. 135, Visnu Db. S. 22. 81, 
Atri v. 31 and others there are twelve malas ( filthy exudations 
or impurities ) of the human body, viz. fat, semen, blood, 
marrow, urine, faeces, mucus of the nose, ear-wax, phlegm, tears,

rheum of eyes, sweat ; and the first six of these are removed by 
water and earth and the latter six by water ( Atri v. 32 ). 

After preforming 6auca one has to rinse the mouth with 
twelve mouthfuls ( gandusa ) of water ( vide Smrtimuktaphala, 
fihnika p. 220). When one finishes the purification of the body by 
washing the hands and feet and by rinsing the mouth one has to 
engage in acamana} hZ1 A good deal has been said about Scamana 
above (pp. 315-316) under upanayana. Acamana (sipping water) 
is to be done after tying the top-knot and tucking up the garment 
from behind ; the water is to be poured in the hollowed palm of 
the hand in such a quantity that a grain of masa ( bean ) will 
be plunged in it and the three fingers except the thumb and the 
small one are to be joined together and the water is to be drunk 
from that part of the hand which is called brahma tlrtha describ- 
ed above (n. 750 ). The word tlrtha means that part of the right 
hand by which water is taken in or poured in religious rites and 
the parts are given the names of deities for lauding them, as Vi&va* 
rupa says. 1538 In most smrfcis their number is four, viz. prajapatya 
orkaya, pitrya, brahma, and daiva (for example in Manu II. 59, 
Visnu Dh. S. 62. 1-4, Yaj. 1. 19, Markandeya-purana 34. 103-109, 
Daksa II. 18). Some works like the Satyayanakalpa and Vrddha- 
Vasistha quoted by Vi^varupa on Yaj. 1. 19 name five tlrthas viz. 
daiva ( when a brahmana faces the east, the front part of his 
hand ), pitrya ( the right portion of the right hand ), brahma 
( the portion of the hand opposite the fingers ), prajapatya ( the 
portion of the hand near the small finger ) and paramesthya 
( the centre of the right palm ). The Par. gr. parisista names 
the above five, except that it substitutes the name agneya for 
pSramesthya. The Sankha-smrti (in verse, X. 1-2) distinguishes 
kaya and prajapatya and omits the name of brahma altogether 
which is called prajapatya by it. Vaik. I. 5 has six, the usual 
four, the fifth being agneya ( centre of the palm ) and the sixth 
being arsa (the roots and tips of all fingers together). According 
to some, daiva tlrtha means the tips of the fingers and the centre 
of the palm is either saumya or agneya. According to Harlta the

daiva 1529 tlrtha is to be used in marjana, worship of gods, offering 
of bait and in bhojana ; the kaya tlrtha is to be employed in I&ja- 
homa ( homa of fried grain ) and daily homa, the pitrya in all 
rites for dead ancestors. Touching the kamandalu ( water jar ), 
eating curds and fresh products of the fields ( navanna ) are to 
be done with the saumya tlrtha ( Smrtyarthasara p. 20 ). When 
there is difficulty of getting water and an occasion for purifi- 
cation by acamana arises, one should touch one's right ,54 Â° ear. 
Very elaborate rules are laid down in the digests on the subject 
of acamana ( e. g. Sm. C. I. pp. 95-104), Smrtimuktaphala, 
Ahnika-prakasa pp. 221-240, Ahnika-tattva pp. 333-344. Gr. K. 
pp. 150-172 &c, which have to be all passed over for want of 
space. One matter to be noticed is that according to the Apas- 
tamba-smrti ( in verse ) the procedure of acamana is of four 
kinds, viz. pauranika ( in which each sipping of water is 
accompanied by the names, Kesava, NarSyana, Madhava &c. ) ; 
smSrta ( as laid down in the smrtis like Manu II. 60 fF ), a" gam a 
( i. e. taught in the sacred books of Saiva and Vaisnava secta- 
rians ) and srauta ( laid down in the Srautasufcras for Vedic 
sacrifices 1S41 ). The first of these four is the method usually 
followed now by most brahmanas. 

Danta-dhavana ( brushing the teeth ). 

Danta-dhavana comes after sauca and acamana and before 
snana( bath ). Vide Yaj. I. 98 and Daksa II. 6. The practice of 
daily danta-dhavana has existed in India from the most ancient 
times. The Tai. S. 1548 ( II. 5. 1. 7 ) when enumerating the 
actions which a rajasvala ( a woman in her monthly period ) 
was to avoid mentions dantadhavana among them and remarks 
that if she indulges in it during that period, she gives birth to 
a son whose teeth are naturally black. Dantadhavana is an 
independent act by itself performed for rendering the body 
( here the mouth ) clean and it is not an anga ( a subordinate

constituent part ) of bath or morning prayer. 154 * Ap. Dh. S. 
I. 2. 8. 5 forbids 1544 one who has returned from his teacher's 
home after finishing his studies to engage in the sight of his 
teacher in such acts of pleasure as cleansing the teeth, shampoo- 
ing the body and combing the hair and also forbids the study 
of the Veda while such actions are going on ( ibid. I. 3. 11. 
10-12 ). 15 * 5 The brahmacarin was noc to engage in the leisurely 
actions of brushing the teeth ( but was to rinse his mouth ) 
according to Gaufc. II. 19 and Vas. Dh. S. VII. 15. 

In dantadhavana one has to take the twig ( with its bark ) 
of certain trees, crush the end of the twig with his teeth so as 
to make a brush of it and then to cleanse his teeth with the 
brush-like end. According to Gobhilasmrti 1546 ( which is also 
called Chandoga-parisista in some works ) if a man only rinses 
his mouth with river water or at home, he has not to repeat a 
mantra, but if he uses a twig he has to repeat a mantra ' Oh 
tree, bestow on me long life, strength, fame, brilliance, offspring, 
cattle, wealth, brahma ( Veda ), memory and intelligence. * In 
the Par. gr. II. 6 and Ap. gr. 12. 6 brushing of the teeth with an 
udumbara twig is prescribed in Samavartana with a mantra 
1 may you be ready for food ; here comes the king Soma ; 
may he clean my mouth with glory and good luck. ' 1547 
Therefore the same mantra is to be employed every day after 
samavartana. In some of the digests ( like the Ahnikaprakasa

pp. 121-122) it Is stated that that mantra may be employed by the 
students of the Sukla Yajurveda, while those who study the 
Gobhila grhya may use the mantra 'ayurbalam &c\ 

Very detailed rules are laid down about the length of the 
twig, about the trees the twigs of which are allowed or 
forbidden, about the days or occasions or times on which there 
is to be no dantadhavana. A few of these details are given 
below. Trees having thorns on their trunk or from which a 
milky fluid oozes out when a twig is broken off are allowed and 
so are va^a, asana, arka, khadira, karanja, badara, sarja, nimba, 
arimeda, apamarga, raalatl, kakubha, bilva, amra (mango), 
punnaga, sirlsa and further the twig must be astringent, 
pungent or bitter in taste and not sweet or sour. 1548 Vide Brhat- 
Sarhhita of Varahamihira chap. 85, Laghu-Harita (Jivananda 
parti, p. 183), Laghu-Vyasa I. 17-18, Nrsimhapurana 58. 47. 
Before the advent of the modern dentrifrices people in India 
followed these directions and even now many even in the cities 
still follow them and brush their teeth with twigs of various 
trees. Among the trees which are not to be used for danta- 
dhavana are palaÂ£a, 1549 slesmataka, arista, vibbltaka, dhava, 
bandhuka, nirgudl, 6igru, tilva, tinduka, inguda, guggulu, saml, 
pllu, pippala, kovidara &c. (Visnu Dh. S. 61. 1-5). The twig 
may be undried or dried, but one dried on the tree itself is not 
to be taken ( Visnu Dh. S. 61. 8, Nrsimhapurana 58. 46 ). 
One must brush the teeth facing north or east, but not west or 
south ( Visnu Dh. S. 61. 12-13 ). Visnu Dh. S. ( 61. 16-17) pres- 
cribes that the twig should be as big as the end of one's 
small finger and twelve ahgulas in length and it should 
be washed before its use and after using it it should not 
be cast off in an impure place. There are various opinions 
about the length of the twig employed. The Nrsimhapurana 
( 58. 49. 50 ) says that it may be of eight angulas in length or a

span in length ( prSdesa ) ; Garga ( quoted in Sm. C. L p. 105 ) 
says that the twig should be 10, 9, 8, 7 or 4 angulas in length 
respectively for the four varnas and women. One was not to 
cleanse one's teeth with pieces of brick or with clods of earth or 
with stones or with the bare ringers ( except the thumb and the 
finger next to the small ringer). 155 Â° 

According to Laghu-Harlta (Jivananda I. p. 183) and Nrsirh- 
hapurana 58. 50-52 there is to be no brushing of the teeth with a 
twig on the 1st tithi, the parva tithis ( i. e. new moon, full moon, 
8th day, 14th day and the day on which the Sun enters a new 
zodiacal sign, according to Visnu-purana III. 11, 118), on the 6th 
tithi and 9th tithi and on those days when twigs are not avail- 
able one may rinse one's mouth with twelve mouthfuls of 
water 1551 . Paithlnasi (quoted in the Sm. 0. I. p. 106) says 
'one may brush one's teeth with grass, leaves and water and 
with the fingers except the 4th finger.' One may also cleanse 
with mouthfuls of water when one has no teeth (Ahnika- 
prakasa, p. 127). One may also rub one's tongue with these 
or with a twig on the days on which it is allowed. There is to 
be no dantadhavana on srSddha day (for the performer), on the 
day of a saorifice, when one is observing niyama, when the 
husband has gone to another country, when there is indigestion, 
on marriage day, on a fast or a vrata ( Smrtyarthasara p. 25 ). 
Visnu 155a Dh. S. 61. 16 prescribes dantadhavana not only in 
the morning but also after taking one's meal. This, as stated 
by Devala, is intended for removing particles of food sticking 
to the teeth or the gums.

other rites are to be performed after holding ku6a grass In the 
right hand some remarks must be offered on kusas. The 
Kurmapurana says 'whatever action is done without darbha 
or without yajnopavlta, it becomes useless and brings no reward 
here or in the next world' (quoted in Krfcyaratnakara p. 47). 
Satatapa 1553 says *in japa, homa, dana, svadhyaya (study of 
the Veda) or in pitrtarpana one should have in his hand gold, 
silver and kusas \ One should have at the time of acamana &c. 
a pavitra ( a ring-like loop ) of darbhas in his right hand or in 
both his hands on the finger next to the small one or have kusa 
in his right hand. There were several views about wearing a 
pavitra or darbhas, as stated in note 1553. The darbha grass is to 
be collected on the daria day (new moon) in the month of Sravana 
and the darbhas so collected are never stale and may be used again 
and again 1554 . The pavitra of the four varnas should be made 
with 4 darbhas or with 3, 2, or 1 respectively or it should be made 
with two darbhas for all ( Smrfcyarthasara pp. 36-37). Those 
darbha blades from which no further blades shoot forth are 
called simply darbhas, blades from which fresh ones sprout 
forth are called kusas, blades with their roots are called kutapas 
and those the tips of which are cut off are called trna 1555 (grass). 
The darbha grass growing in a field of sesame and having 
seven blades is very auspicious. 

The darbhas to be used in yajiias should be green in colour, 
yellowish for use in pakayajilas, they should be with roots when 
used in rites for the pitrs and variegated when used in vaisva- 
deva Those darbhas that were held in the hand at the time 
of offering pindas to the dead or in sraddhas or in pitrtarpana or 
at the time of urination or voiding* faeces should be thrown 
away ( Smrtyarthasara p. 37). If kusa grass is not available, 
then kasa or durva may be employed instead.

658 History of Dharmaifatra [ Ch. XVII 

The subject of sn5na can be treated from various points of 
view. Sn5na 1S56 is either mukhya ( principal ) or gauvta 
(secondary), the first being a bath with water and the second being 
without water. Each of these is again subdivided into various 
kinds. According to Daksa II. 48 snana is nitya (obligatory 
every day), naitnittika (to be performed on certain ocoasions), 
and kamya (to be performed only if one desires certain rewards). 
All the varnas 1557 have to bathe in or with water every day 
the whole body together with the head also ( Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 
4, Manu II. 176 and IV. 82 ) and dvijatis have to do it with 
Vedic mantras. This is nitya. This 1558 is required to be done, 
because a man who has not bathed is not entitled to perform 
boma, japa and other rites (Sankha VIII. 2, Daksa II. 9 ). The 
body is dirty and from it ooze various exudations day and night 
and a bath in the morning cleanses and purifies the body. In 
this way snana has seen and unseen ( i. e. spiritual ) results ,559 . 

Some works ( Yaj. I. 95, 100, Laghu-Asvalayana I. 16, 75, 
Daksa II. 9 and 43 &c. ), prescribe two baths a day for brahmana 
house-holder^, one before day-break and another at noon. There 
is only one bath a day for brahmacarins, two for forest hermits 
( Manu VI. 6). According to Manu VI. 22 and Yaj. III. 48 the forest 
hermit has to bathe thrice ( in the morning, at noon and in the 
evening ) and a yati has also to bathe thrice 156 Â°. Though even 
now some orthodox brahmana householders do perform two baths 
a day, the usual rule for all Hindus (including even the so- 
called untouchables ) is to bathe once a day, which also has

been the general rale for centuries ( vide Smrtyarthasara p. 26 
1 sarve vapi sakrfc kuryur ). Snana is usually done now before 
noon, that in the early morning being done only by a yali t one 
observing a vrata % a brahmacarin, sacrificial priests, students of 
the Veda and those engaged in austerities (Smrtyarthasara 
p. 27). The morning bath is to be taken immediately after 
brushing the teeth before day-break when one sees the eastern 
direction lit up by the morning rays of the rising sun 
(Visnu W1 Dh. S. 64. 8). Gobhila-smrfci (II. 24) says that mt one 
should not lengthen out the process of taking the morning bath 
(by repeating too many mantras) as it would come in the way 
of performing the morning homa at the proper time, which is 
between the first appearance of light and the sun's reaching 
about one cubit above the eastern horizon ( Gobhila I. 122-123 )â¦ 
Vide Manu II. 15 also. The madhyahna ( midday ) bath 
is to be performed in the fourth part of the day-time divided 
into eight parts ( Daksa II. 43, Laghu-Vyasa II. 9 ) and one has 
to bring together loose earth, cow-dung, flowers, whole rice 
grains, kusas, sesame and sandalwood paste ,582 . This midday 
bath is not to be performed by one who is ill. The third bath 
( in the case of forest hermits and yatis ) is to be performed 
before sunset, but not after sun-set or at night. No bathing is 
allowed for any one at night except when there is an eclipse 
or the sun passes into the zodiacal signs of Cancer and Capri- 
corn ( at night ), a marriage, a birth or death or when a vrata 
is undertaken with some object 156 \ Night means specially 
the two middle watches ( Manu IV. 129, Kulluka thereon and 
Parasara XII. 27 ).

WO History of LharmaiUstra [ Ch. XVII 

The obligatory (nitya) bath is to be taken with cold water 
and ordinarily hot water is not allowed. Sankha ( VIII. 9-10 ) 
gays that if one bathes with heated water or in water belonging 
to another individual, he may effect the cleansing of the body 
but he would not secure the unseen spiritual result of a bath. 
Daksa II. 64 is to the same effect 1565 . Naimittika and kamya 
baths must be performed with cold water, there is an option 
only as to nitya (daily obligatory) bath (Garga quoted in the 
Sm. O.I. p. 123). 

Manu IV. 203, Visnu Dh. S. 64. 1-2 and 15-16, Yaj. 1. 159, 
Daksa II. 43, Veda-Vyasa-smrti III. 7-8, Sankha VIII. 11 and 
others say that one must daily bathe in natural water, i. e. in 
rivers, in tanks connected with temples, in lakes, in deep 
reservoirs and in mountain springs. One should not bathe 
in water belonging to an individual ( i. e. a well or reser- 
voir dug or dammed by him &o. ) but if no water is other- 
wise available one may bathe with such water after re- 
moving three or five lumps of clay (from the bottom of 
the reservoir 1568 ) or three or five jars from the well. The 
idea is that either the private owner would participate in 
the merit of the bath ( as Baud. Dh. S. IF. 3. 7 remarks ) or that 
the bather incurs a fourth part of the sin of the owner of the 
water ( Manu IV. 201-202 ). If no such water is available or 
one is unable to go to a river &c. for a bath one may bathe in 
the court-yard of one's house with water drawn in a vessel (from 
a well &c. ) till his clothes are wetted. The words ' nadl * 
and ' garta ' ( used in Manu IV. 203 ) are defined as follows : 
a nadl (river) is one that has a stream of water at least 
8000 bows in length, while all other streams are called garta 
( a pool ). As in the months of Sravana and Bhadrapada all 
rivers are full of mud ( rajasvala is used in a double sense ) one 
should not bathe in them in those months, except in rivers that

directly reach the sea, 1587 But ev en in these months one may 
bathe in muddy rivers at the time of upakarma or utsarga, or 
on the death of a person or on the eclipse of the sun or the 
moon. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 64. 17 which says that out of water 
drawn in a pot, water standing in a reservoir, a spring, a river, 
water in which noble men of the past bathed, Ganges water, 
each succeeding one is holier than each preceding one for 
*bath. 1888 

The actual bath is described differently in different sutras, 
smrtis and digests. Gobhila-smrti (1. 137) says 1569 that the morning 
bath contains the same procedure as the mid-day bath. The 
morning bath has to be brief, as already stated, in the case of 
one who has consecrated the srauta fires. The procedure of 
bathing will be indicated by a few brief extracts. The Visnu 
Dh. S. ( 64. 18-22 ) says 'having removed 1570 the dirt from his 
body with water and loose earth, he should plunge in water, 
he should invoke the water with the three verses ' 5po hi s^ha * 
( Rg. X. 9. 1-3 ), with the four verses ' hiranyavarn&h ' 
( Tai. S. V. 6. 1. 1-2 ) and with the verse ' idam&pah 
pravahata â¢ ( Rg. I. 23. 22 or X. 9. 8 ). Then while still plunged 
in water he should thrice mutter the Aghamarsana hymn ( Bg. 
X. 190. 1-3, rtam ca satyam &c. ) or he may mutter 'tad visnoli 
paramam padam ' ( Rg. I. 22. 20 ) or the Drupada Savitrl verse 
(Vaj. S. 20. 20) or the anuvfika beginning with 'yuSjate 
mana* ( Rg. V. 81. 1-5 ) or the Purusasukta ( Rg. X. 90. 1-16), 
1 Having bathed he should, with his garment still wet, perform 
tarpaiia of gods and Manes while still in the water. But if he 
has changed his clothes, then he may do it (tarpana) after

coming out of the water'. Even now many brahmanas mutter 
the Purusasiikta while bathing. Sankha-smrti ( IX ) has a brief 
description of snana which consists in invoking water, then 
marjana with the three verses (apo hi stha), then repeating 
.certain Vedic verses like * hiranya-varnah', 'san-r.o devlr\ '6am 
<na apah* (Atharvaveda I. 6. 1 and 4) and thrice repeating Agha- 
marsana. Vide Madanaparijata pp. 270-271, Gr. R. pp. 206-208 
and Par. M. I. 1. pp. 274-275 where the whole of Sankha (IX) 
is quoted. The Snanasutra 157! of Katyayana says "Now then 
will be treated the daily obligatory bath in a river and the like. 
Having fetched loose earth, cowdung, sesame, kusas and flowers, 
having approached the water side, having placed (the above) 
materials on a pure spot, having washed one's hands and feet, 
holding kusa blades ( or pavitra) in his hand, tying up his top 
knot and wearing the yajnopavlta, he should perform acamana 
and invoke the water with the verse 'urum hi* (Rg. I. 24. 8= Vaj. 
B. 8. 23), stir it (with his thumb) with the verses 'ye te satam* 
(vide Par. gr. I. 2). He should fill his joined hands with water 
with the verse 'sumitriya nah* (Vaj. S. VI. 22) and should cast it 
on the ground with the verse 'durmitriya' (Vaj. S. VI. 22) in the 
direction of his enemy. He should apply loose earth thrice to each 
of the limbs, viz. the waist, the abdomen, thighs, feet and hands, 
then perform acamana, should do obeisance to the water and 
should smear his body with loose earth. Facing the sun with the 
verse 'idam visnur' ( ftg. I. 22. 17 = Vaj. S. 5. 15 ), he- should 
dive into the water and bathe with the verse 'apo asman' 
(Bg. X. 17. 10=Vaj. S. IV. 2), then raise up his body with 
the mantra ' ud-id-abhy ah ' ( Vaj. S. IV. 2 ), again dip into water 
and again raise his head out of the water, perform acamana

the verses ' ma apo \ ' uduttamam ' ( Vaj, S. 12. 12 ), ' muficantu ', 
( Rg. X. 97. 16 = Vaj. S. 12. 90 ), 4 avabbrtba ' ( Vaj. S. III. 48 ). 
At the end of these mantras he should dive into the water and 
then rise up out of it, perform acamana and sprinkle with 
darbha blades his body with the nine verses, viz. the three 
beginning with 'apo hi 8tha* (Bg. X. 9. 1-3 = Vaj. S. 11. 50-52), 
* idam-apah ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 17 ), with the two verses ' havismatlf *

devlr ' ( Vaj. S. 35. 12)/ apam rasam ' (Vaj. S. 9. 3 ), 'apo devlh', 
and ' punantu ma \ Then he should repeat thrice, while diving 
in water, the Aghamarsana hymn ( Rg, X. 190. 1-3 ) preceded 
by the mantra ' cit patir-ma ' ( Vaj. S. 4. 4 ), by the syllable om, 
by the vyabrtis, by the Gayatrl and followed by the same ; or 
he may repeat the verse ' drupadad-iva ' ( Vaj. S. 20. 20 ) or the 
three verses ' ayam gauh ' ( Rg. X. 189. 1-3 = Vaj. S. 3. 6 ) or he 
should perform pranayama with the siras ( viz. apo jyotl raso 
Srartam brahma &c. cited above on p. 304 from Tai. A. X. 15 ) 
or he should repeat simply 'ora' thrice or he should only 
contemplate on Visnu. Having come out of the water, he 
should put on two washed garments, should wash his hands 
and thighs with loose earth, should perform acamana and then 
pranayama thrice ", 1578 

Yogi-Yajnavalkya quoted by Apararka and other works 
says that when a man is unable to perform the elaborate 
snana desoribed by himself and others, he should engage only 
in this ; he should invoke the water, then perform acamana, 
then mfirjana ( sprinkling water on body with kusa blades ) 
and then snana and muttering of Aghamarsana ORg. X. 190.1-3) 1573 
thrice. The Gr. R. ( pp. 215-217 ) quotes the method of snana 
according to the Padmapurana and the Nrsirhhapurana and 
remarks that the procedure in the Padmapurana may be observed 
by all varnas and by men following all the different Vedic 
schools ( except the Vedic mantras in the case of sudras ). The 
Smrtyarthasara (p. 28 ) also gives a brief procedure of snana,

There are certain rules to be observed when bathing. One 
was not to bathe naked ( Gaut. IX. 61 and Manu IV. 45 \ 
nor with all clothes on ( but only with the lower garment ) 
nor after taking one's meal ( Manu 4. 29 ) ; one was not to rub 
the body in water but outside on the bank, one should not 
strike the water with one's foot or hand or dash a portion of the 
water against the rest. 1574 

The earth to be employed ( like soap ) for cleansing the 
body was to be obtained from a pure place and not from an 1575 
ant-hill or from places infested by mice, nor from under water, 
nor from the public road, nor from the bottom of a tree, nor 
from near temples, nor out of what was left by some person 
after using a portion for his own 6auca and is to be invoked 
with two verses 4 aSvakrante 1576 &o. * Laghu-Harlfca ( v. 70-71 ) 
says ' earth seoured after digging eight angulas from the surface 
should be used, all earth is pure which is taken from a place not 
frequented by people and that ten kinds of earth should not 
be used at the time of bathing ' ( verses 72-73 ). 

The brahmaoarin was not to bathe in a leisurely or sporting 
manner but to dive in water motionless like a stick. 

The MahSbharata, Daksa and others say that ten good 
consequences follow from snana viz. strength, beauty, clearness 
of complexion and voice, ( pleasant ) touch and odour ( of the 
body ), purity, prosperity, delicacy and fine women. 1577 

Bathing with water is divided into six varieties by Sankha

kriyasnana. Nitya snana (daily bath) has been desoribed above. A 
few observations are made below on each of the others. On certain 
occasions or on coming in contact with certain persons or things 
one has to bathe, although one may have already bathed that day. 
This is called naimittika ( due to some occasion or cause ) sndna. 
For example, on the birth of a son, in a sacrifice ( at the end ), on 
the passing away of a relative, in eclipses, one has to bathe and 
even at night ,5T8 ( Par&sara XII. 26 and Devala quoted above ). 
Similarly a man has to bathe with all his clothes on if he 
touches an outcast ( who is guilty of one of the mortal sins ), a 
cSndala, a woman who has recently delivered, a woman in her 
monthly course, a corpse, or one who has touched a corpse or one 
who has touched another that has come in contact with a corpse 
or when a man follows a corpse ,579 ( Qaut. 14. 28-29, Vas. 4. 38, 
Manu V. 85 and 103, Yaj. III. 30, Laghu-AsvalSyana 20. 24 ). 
According to Manu V. 144, Sankha-smrti VIII. 3, Mark. purSna 
34. 82-83, Brahmapurana 113. 79, Parasara XII. 28, if a man 
vomits or has many purges ( ten or more ), if he has a shave or 
has a bad dream, has had sexual intercourse, if he repairs to a 
cemetery, or is covered with smoke from a funeral pyre or touches 
a sacrificial post or a human bone, he has to undergo a bath to 
purify himself 158 Â°. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 16 prescribes a bath if a 
man is bitten by a dog and Gaut. 1 4. 30 prescribes it even for 
touching it. If a man touches Bauddhas, Pasupatas, Jainas, 
Lokayatikas, atheists, dvijatis living by condemned actions 
and sudras he should bathe with his clothes ,5SI on. Tho Mit. 
on Yaj. III. 30, the Sm. O. I. pp. 117-119 and other digests 
speak of snana being necessary on coming in contact with

several birds (like the crow) and animals (like the cook and 
village hog ), which are passed over for want of space. 

Kamya-mana 1 *** (bath for some desired object) is that 
which is taken when one goes to a tlrtha ( a sacred place ) or 
when there is some astrological conjunction like the moon being 
in the constellation of pusya (vide Sankhasmrti VIII, 4) or when 
one bathes in the morning in the two months of Magha and 
Ph&lguna for securing abundant pleasures. Vide Sm. C. I. 
pp. 122-123 for numerous examples. 

When a man has to take a bath as a part of the religious 
rite such as the rite of dedicating a well, a temple, a park to the 
public, that is called kriyahga-snUm} l%z 

When a man applies oil to his body, uses myrobalans and 
engages in a bath solely for cleaning the body ( and with no 
idea of performing an obligatory duty or securing religious 
merit ) that is called malapakar^aka or abhyanga-mana. The 
Sm.C. I. p. 125, Apararka pp. 195-196 and other works lay down 
elaborate rules about this snana. One rule is that on certain 
tithis like parva ( vide Manu IV 128 and Ysj I. 79 above on 
p. 204 ) there is to be no bath with oil &o. It is said that one 
desiring prosperity should use dried myrobalan ( amalaka ) 
at the time of bath except on the 7th and 9th tithis and on parva 
days. 158 * Vide Vamanapurana 14. 49 ff. ( quoted in Sm. C. I, 
p. 125 ) for astrological rules. 

When a man regards bathing at a sacred place the reward 
of his pilgrimage and engages in the procedure prescribed 
by Sankhasmrti IX that is called Imyasnana. im 

A person who is ill may bathe with hot water or he may, if 
he cannot bear that, only wash his body except the head or his 
body may be rubbed with a wet piece of cloth. This last method

is called kapUa-mana}*â¢ There is another method where a man 
is ill and something happens on which it is absolutely necessary 
for him to bathe ; in this case one who is not ill should touch 
him and then bathe himself and then again touch him and 
bathe ; when this is repeated ten times the person who is ill 
is deemed to have become pure as if he had bafched. 1587 In the 
case of a woman in her monthly course, if on the fourth day 
she has high fever, she is not to be bathed, but another woman 
is to touch her and bathe with all her clothes on and perform 
ftcamana and touch her and bathe again ; this is to be carried 
out ten or twelve times and in the end the clothes worn by 
the ailing woman are to be taken off and new ones to be given 
to her and she becomes clean. 1888 

The bath with water is called Varuna (as Varuna is the lord 
of waters, according to Rg. VII. 49. 3 ' ySsftm r5ja Varuno ' &o. ) 
and.Vfiruna is the principal kind of bath. There are six kinds of 
gauria snanas which may be employed when one is either ill and 
so unable as to undergo a regular bath or when there is no time 
or room to take a regular bath. These six ( with Varuna as the 
seventh ) are enumerated and defined in Yogayajnavalkya and 
other works and they are: mantrasnana, bhauma, agneya, 
vayavya, divya, manasa. Daksa II. 15-16 and Parasara 
XII. 9-11 mention these except bhauma and manasa and 
employ the word brUhma in place of mantrasnSna. The Vaik. 
gr. ( I 2 and 5 ) employs both words ' mantra ' and 'gurvanujfia' 
as synonymous. Garga and Brhaspati omit bhauma and manasa 
and speak of sarasvata-snana instead, which consists in the 
blessing pronounced by a learned man in the case of a dvijati, 
or a pupil or his son ' may you have a bath with golden jars of 
Ganges water and of other sacred waters ' ( vide Ahnika-prakaÂ§a

pp. 196-197). The mantrasnSna 1589 consists in sprinkling 
water with the verses ' 5po hi stha * ( Rg. X. 9. 1-3 ), the bhauma 
( or parthiva ) in smearing the body with loose earth, agneya in 
smearing the body with holy ashes, vayavya in taking on the 
body the dust raised by the hoofs of cows, divya in wetting 
one's body with a shower of rain accompanied with sunshine 
and manasa in reflecting on God Visnu. 

Tarpatita ( offering water to gods, sages and Manes ) is an 
anga ( a subsidiary constituent part ) of snana, just as it is an 
anga in brahma-yajfla. When a person plunges his whole body 
in water including the head, he has to perform tarpaw while 
still standing in the water. Vide Manu II. 176, Visnu Dh. S. 64. 
23-24 (quoted above in n,1570), ParSsara XII. 12-13 for this. He 
joins his two hands together, takes water in the joined hands 
and casts the water into the stream in which he is standing. 
If he changes his clothes, then he may perform the tarpana 
on the bank of the river. There was a difference of opinion 
about tarpana. Some said 1590 that a man had to perform tarpana 
as an anga of snana immediately after it and before samdhya 
prayer and then again the same day as an anga of brahmayajfla ; 
while others held that tarpana was to be performed only 
once in the day after samdhya prayer. One has to perform 
tarpapa according to the procedure prescribed in one's Sakha 
( Vedio school ) but Sankha prescribes a brief tarpana which 
consists in the words ' may the universe from Brahnia down 
to a bunch of grass be satisfied ' ( or satiated ) and offering three 
afljalis ( joined hands ) of water. When he performs tarpana

standing in water, he should not wring the water from the ends 
of his garment until he has finished it. He should then 
wring 1591 the ends of his garment and the water so falling down 
is deemed to he meant for the sonless deoeased persons horn in 
the family of the hather and he has to repeat a verse to 
that effect. Further details of tarparia are set out under 
brahmayajna below. 

After one takes a bath one was not to shake one's head 
( for getting rid of the water ), nor should one rub off the water 
on one's body with one's hand or with the garment already 
worn by one ; one has to cover one's head with a turban ( to 
dry the hair ) and wear two fresh garments already washed and 
dried ( Visnu Dh. S. 64. 9-13 ). 

What clothes the brahmaoann was to wear has already 
been stated ( pp. 278-279 ). A few words must be said about the 
clothes to be worn by a householder. 

Weaving and woven cloth are frequently referred to in the 
Veda, generally in a metaphorical sense or in similes. Vide 
Rg. 1. 115. 4, II. 3. 6, V. 29. 15, X. 106. 1. In $g. VI. 9. 2-3, 
both warp (tantu) and woof (olu) are mentioned. The words 
used for garment are 'vasas' or Vastra'. In the Tai. S. (VI. 1. 1. 3) 
it is said that kÂ§auma (linen) cloth is worn when a person takes 
the dlksa (initiatory rite) for a Vedio sacrifice. In the Kanaka 
Sam. XV. 1 ksauma cloth is said to be the fee in a certain rite. 
In the Atharvaveda VIII, 2. 16 we have the two words ' vasah * 
(outer garment) and 'nlvf (under garment) 1 * 98 used with reference 
to the same man. In the Rg. the word * adhivasa ' is also 
used with reference to a garment which must Tiave been some- 
what like a mantle or toga ( Rg. I. 162. 16 ). In the Tai. S. II. 
4. 9. 2. the skin of the black deer is mentioned. In the Sat. 
Br. V. 2. 1. 8 it is said that when the $estr 15fiS priest is about 
to lead up the sacrificer's wife he makes her put on a kusa 
upper garment (vasas) or a kusa skirt next to the cloth that

one who is initiated for the sacrifice wears. In the Br. Up. II. 
3. 6. there ,m is a reference to cloth dyed red with safflower or 
woollen cloth that is whitish in colour. Rg. IV. 22. 2 and Bg. 
V. 52. 9 are interpreted by Western scholars as referring to 
wool on the Parusnl river being the best, but the sense is rather 
obscure. It appears from the above that cloth was either 
woollen or linen, that silken ( or ku6a ) cloth was worn on very 
solemn occasions, that deer-skin was also employed as covering 
and that cloth was also dyed red. Whether cotton cloth was 
known in the earliest Vedic period is not certain. It is clear 
that in the sutras ( Visnu Dh. S. 71. 15 and 63. 24 ) and in 
Manu ( 8. 326 and 12. 64 ) cotton cloth is known and so its use 
must have reached several centuries before the times of the 
Butras. Arrian ( tr. by MacCrindle) says that Indian dress was 
made of cotton (p. 219 ). 

The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 4. 22-23) requires that a householder 
should always wear an upper garment ( besides the lower one ) 
but allows him to have only the sacred thread instead ( if he be 
poor &c. ). Vas. Dh. S. XII. 14 says that smtakas ( those who 
have returned from the stage of student-hood ) should always 
wear a lower garment and an upper one, two yajfiopavltas 
&c. The Baud. Dh. S. I. 3. 2. says the same and adds that a sna- 
taka should wear a turban, a deer-skin as upper garment, shoes 
and have an umbrella. Apararka ( pp 133-134 ) quotes verses 
from Vyaghra and YogaySjnavalkya to the same effect, the latter 
remarking that if one cannot procure a second washed garment 
one may wear a blanket of wool, or hempen or linen cloth. Baud. 
Dh. S. (1. 6. 5-6, 10-11) says 'among garments 1895 the one that has 
not been worn is pure and therefore everything connected with 
sacrifice and worship should be done with fresh ( or unblemi- 
shed) clothes. The sacrifices his wife and the priests should wear 
garments that have been washed, dried in the wind and are not 
worn out by use ; but in sacrifices performed for abhicara (harm 
fcp one's enemies) the priests should wear clothes and turbans dyed 
red. In consecrating the Vedic fires one should wear clothes made

on Jaimini X. 4. 13 quotes iruti passages to the effect that the 
sacrificer and his wife wear fresh unused clothes in the model 
sacrifice and in the Mahavrata the sacrificer wears in addition 
a tarpya ( silk garment ) and his wife wears one made of kusa 
grass. 1596 Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 66 requires that one must wear 
an upper garment in five acts viz. study of the Veda, dedication 
of a well or a tank &o. to the public, making gifts, taking 
one's meal or aoamana. Similarly the Visnupurana (III. 12. 20) 
requires that a man must not, with only one garment on, begin 
homa, the worship of gods and similar rifces, study of the 
Veda, acamana and japa* m Gaut. 9. 4-5, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 
10-13, Manu IV. 34-35, Yaj. I. 131 and others enjoin that a 
snataka and a householder should wear white garments and 
they must not be worn out or dirty if he has enough ( means ) 
and should not wear dyed garments or garments of high price 
( or gaudy ones ) or those worn by another. 1898 Baud. Dh. S. 
II. 8. 24 remarks ' what a man, while wearing reddish garments, 
does such as japa, homa, receiving gifts, offerings made 
to gods and Manes, does not reach the gods. 1899 Cloth dyed in 
indigo is also forbidden arfll a male has to undergo a fast and 
take paflcagavya for wearing such cloth. The Apastamba smrti 
( in verse ) chap. VI has several verses on cloth dyed in indigo. 
The Mit. on Yaj. III. 292 quotes verses 1-5 of Apastamba. Vide 
Apararka p. 1186 for quotation of the same verses and also of 
Angiras, verses 32-39 (which are almost the same as Apastamba's). 
Gaut, 9. 5-7, ManuIV.66,VisnuDh.S.71.47,M5rk.purfina ,600 34.

yajnopavlta, ornament, garland, or water-jar used by another 
but if a man is unable to seoure one for himself, he may wear 
another's garment or shoes or garland after cleansing it. 
According to Garga quoted in the Sm. C. ( L p. 113 ) a brahmana 
should wear white garments, a ksatriya red and brilliant ones, 
a vateya yellow ones, a &ftdra should wear a dark one that is 
dirty. The Mahfibharata says that one has to wear garments at 
the time of worshipping gods that are different from those that 
one wears while walking on a road or when one is in bed 1601 Â« 
Prajapati quoted by Par. M. states that in tarpa^a one should 
wear silk cloth having a hem or one that is orange-coloured, but 
never one that is gaudy. Probably it is requirements like these 
that led to the practice of wearing silken garments at the time 
of meals and worship, which practice is observed even now in 
many parts of India. Manu IV. 18 and Visnu Dh, S. 71. 5-6 
prescribe that one must dress, speak and entertain thoughts that 
would be in keeping with one's age, occupation, monetary 
affairs, learning, family and country. The garments to be worn 
by the vanaprastha and samnyftsin will be discussed below. 
The smrtis contain rules about tucking up the lower garment. 
A garment should be tucked in three places i. e. when it is 
tucked near the navel, on the left side and behind on the back. 
A brSbmana is said to be a dQdra as long as he has not tucked his 
garment behind or allows one corner of it to hang down from

firdhvapundra (vertical mark of a line or lines on the forehead) 
one may select earth from the top of mountains or from banks 
of holy rivers like the Indus and the Ganges, from places sacred 
to Visnu, from ant-hills and from the root of the tulasl 
plant. The thumb, the middle finger and the finger next to 
the small finger are to be used in making the mark, but the 
nails should not come in contact with the earth employed. The 
mark may be of the form of a lamp and its wick, or of the form 
of bamboo leaves or a lotus bud, or of a fish or tortoise or 
a conch and the mark may be in length from two to ten 
fingers. The marks are to be made on the forehead, the 
chest, the throat and its pit, on the abdomen, the right and 
left sides, the arms, the ears, the back, the back of the neck, 
after taking the twelve names of Visnu ( viz. Kesava, Narayana 
&c. ) for each of the above twelve parts of the body. The tri- 
pundra mark (three oblique lines) is to be made with holy ashes 
(bhasman) and the tilaka with sandalwood paste. 1 * 03 According to 
the Brahmandapurana, the urdhvapundra is made after a bath 
with loose earth in such a way that it resembles the outline of 
the foot ( of Hari ), 1C0 * the tripur^dra with holy ashes after homa, 
and the tilaka ( a circular mark ) with sandalwood paste on 
worshipping gods ( devapuja ). The Sm. M. ( ahnika p. 292 ) 
quotes Vasudevopanisad for making the urdhvapundra mark on 
the forehead and other places with Goplcandana ( magnesian or 
calcareous clay ) or in its absence with earth from the roots of 
the tulasi plant. Sacrifice, giffcs, japa, homa, study of the Veda, 
tarpana of the Manes, if done without the urdhvapundra mark, 
become fruitless ( according to Visnu quoted in Sm. M. ahnika 
p. 292 ). The Vrddha-Harlta smrti (II. 58-72) has a long note on 
urdhvapundra. The Sm. M. (ahnika p. 296) notes that some texts of 
the Pa&upata and other Saiva sectarians run down urdhvapundra 
and highly extol the tripundra mark, while Pancaratra texts 
enjoin the marking of the body with 6ankha, cakra and other 
weapons of Visnu and condemn tripundra. Devout worshippers 
of Visnu who are followers of Madhvacarya brand the weapons of

Visnu such as the conch on their arms and bodies with heated metal 
pieces, just as early Christians stamped the cross on the forehead 
with red-hot iron ( vide Wilson's ' Religious Seeks of the Hindus', 
vol. I. p. 42 ). Works like Vrddha-Harlta II. 44-45, the Prthvl- 
candrodaya condemn the practice of branding the body with 
marks of the conch &c. with red-hot iron as fit only for sudras. The 
Smrtyartha-sagara of Chal&ri quotes passages of the VayupurSna 
and Visnupurana supporting branding. In the K&lagnirudropa- 
nisad the procedure 1805 of the tripundra mark is laid down. Holy 
ashes are taken from the sacred fire with the five mantras 'sadyo 
jatam * ( Tai. Ar. 10. 43-47 ) and they are then invoked with the 
mantras 'agniriti bhasma'; part of the ashes is then taken 
in the palm of one's hand with the mantra 'ma nastoke', 
( Rg. I. 114. 8 ) and mixed with water and therewith lines 
are made on the head, the forehead up to the (middle 
of the ) eyebrows and eyes, on the chest and shoulders, 
after repeating * tryayusam Jamadagner ' when applying the 
ashes to the forehead, ' kasyapasya tryayusam ' when applying 
to the navel ( or chest ) and so on ( the head coming last ). 
The Sankhyayana gr. says ,608 " He makes the tripundra mark 
with ashes with the five formulas ' tryayusam ' &c, on his 
forehead, chest, right and left shoulders and then on the back; 
( by doing this ) he studies these Vedas, one, two, three or all." 
The Smrtimuktaphala l807 ( ahnika p. 301 ) quotes a passage 
from Baudhayana in which the words of the exhortation to the 
pupil returning home ' bhutyai na pramaditavyam * occurring 
in the Tai. Up. I. 11 are interpreted as referring to the making 

1605. Vide Sm. M. p. 801 for all details. Even now parts of a 
mantra are used in applying holy ashes to the forehead, to the navel, to 
the right and left shoulders and the head. The mantra occurs in awr. *r.

of the tripundra mark with ashes ( bhuti ). This is a fine example 
of how sectarians twist the words of ancient texts to bolster up 
their practices and dogmas. In the Kadambarl (para 34) Harlta 
is described as ornamented by the tripundra mark of ashes. 
The Aoaramayukha quotes a verse from the Bhavisyapurana 
' of him who does not bear the tripundra mark, truthfulness, 
iauca, japa, homa, pilgrimage and worship of godsâ all this 
becomes futile ' and a verse from the Smrtiratnavali as to the 
parts of the body that are to be smeared with holy ashes, viz. the 
forehead, the region of the heart/navel, throat, shoulders, the 
joints of the arms, the back and the head. The Smrtimuktaphala 
( ahnika p. 310 ) gives the following sage advice to the Saiva 
and Vaisnava sectarian writers that were guilty of running 
down the practices of eaoh other * As one God appears in the 
form of various deities, all should worship their ( favourite ) 
god, whether Siva, Visnu or any other, without indulging 
in the calumny of other deities and they should wear the 
pundra mark that is deemed to be pleasing to any deity 
without calumniating other sect marks V 608 The Nirnayasindhu 
( II pariccheda ) when dealing with the 11th day of Asadha 
sets out from the Ramarcana-candrika passages about the 
marking of the body with conch figure by means of heated 
metal pieces and also quotes the Pfthvlcandrodaya and other 
works that condemn such practices and remarks that one may 
follow the sistas. The acararatna ( p. 37 a ) states that votaries 
are of several kinds, viz. Saivas and Vaisnavas who are purely 
followers of the Vedio cult, 6aivas and Vaisnavas who follow 
both Vaidika and Tantrika practices and the same two following 
purely the Tantric cult. 

After bath comes samdhya ( Yaj. I. 98 ). This subject has 
been dealt with above ( pp. 312-321 ) under Upanayana. 

After samdhya comes homa (Daksa II. 28 and Yaj. I. 98-99). 
If a brahmana took a bath in the early morning and engaged in 
a lengthy samdhya prayer he may not be able to perform homa 
in the morning at the proper time. Homa was performed in 
the morning before sunrise according to one view ( anudite 
juhoti) and after sunrise, according to another ( udite juhoti ) ; 
but even on the latter view, homa must be performed before the

Bun rises one cubifc above the horizon ( Gobhila-smrfci I, 123 ). 1609 
The evening homa is to be performed at a time when the stars 
clearly appear in the sky and the ruddy colour has left the 
western horizon ( Gobhila-smrfci 1. 124 ). As v. Sr. II. 2 and Asv. 
gr. I. 9. 5 state the time for morning homa to be up to the end 
of the period of sangava ( i. e. the second of the five periods of 
day time ). Therefore some said that in order to perform homa 
in time one may perform the morning samdhya prayer even after 
homa. 1610 It has been shown above ( p. 425 ) that the belief was 
;hat a man owed three debts one of .which, viz. that to the gods, 
was discharged by performance of sacrifices and that a man 
had to perform agnihotra ( fire worship ) to the end of his life. 
The fire to be tended was either srauta or smarta. As to the 
irst there were certain rules. Only a person that had attained 
i certain age was to kindle the srauta fires, viz. one who had 
i sou or had reached an age when he could have a son and 
arhose hair was still black ( i. e. who had not become middle-aged 
3r old ). There were two views on the necessity of kindling the 
frauta fires. Vas. Dh. S. XL 45-48 16I! says " a brahmana must 
necessarily kindle the three srauta fires and offer ( in them ) the 
Darsa-Purnamasa ( new moon and full moon sacrifices ), the 
Agrayana is^i, the Caturmasyas, the animal and soma sacrifices. 
For this is enjoined as an observance and has been lauded as 
% debt. For it is declared ( in the Veda ) ' a brahmana is born

indebted in three debts, in sacrifice to the gods &o." Sahara 
on Jaimini V. 4. 16 expressly says that there is no particular 
time fixed for kindling the sacred fires and that a person 
may do so the very day on which the pious de3ire to do 
so arises in hia mind lcia . The Trikandaraandana I. 6-7 
refers to the two views that adhana ( kindling of srauta fires ) 
is nifcya ( obligatory ) and the other view ( discussed by Baudha- 
yana) that it is merely kamya (to be performed only if one 
desires the fulfilment of certain objects ). The person who had 
kindled the sacred fires offered his daily oblations in them. It is 
clear that even in'very ancient times not many kindled the sacred 
Vedic fires. The Grhya and Dharma sutras often contain rules 
referring to those who had kindled the sacred fires and to those 
who had not. For example, the Asv. gr. I. 1. 4 quotes Rg. VIII. 
19. 5 'the person who lays a fuel stick on fire, or throws an 
oblation on it or offers it the study of the Veda, or who pays 
adoration to Agni, (in substance) offers a good sacrifice.' As v. 
gr. then quotes a brahmana passage explaining im Rg. VIII. 
19. 5 in which reliance is also placed on two more Rk verses 
( viz. Rg. VIII. 24. 20 and VI. 16. 47 ). The purpose of all this is 
to show that even the study of the Veda, the performing of 
namaskara and offering of a samidh in the fire are equivalent 
to a real sacrifice. That shows that it was not obligatory on 
every-body to-kindie the three sacred fires. But it must be 
said that agnihotra was highly thought of in ancient India. 
Vide Chandogya Up. V. 24. 5 for a verse extolling it. 

The three fires (often called Treta) are the Ahavanlya, 
Garhapatya and Daksinagni. The Ahavanlya fire-place is a square, 
Garhapatya is round (as the earth is round) and Daksinagni is 
in the form of half the orb of the moon ( vide Vrddha-Gautama 
p. 604, Jivananda). Tn the Brahmanas and Srautasutras ela- 
borate discussions are held about the kindling of fires (agnya- 
dhana), about the several sacrifices and the various details 
connected therewith. It has been decided, in view of the vastness 
of the subject of srauta rites and the academic nature for modern 
times of the treatment of most of those rites, to pass them over

in this work and to give in a separate chapter at the end of 
this volume only some information about the sirauta sacrifices. 
For about two thousand years hardly any animal or soma sacri- 
fices have been performed (except rarely by kings, nobles and rich 
people). In medieval times there were many brahmanas who 
performed the New and Full moon sacrifices, the Agrayana isti 
and the Caturmasyas. But in modern times even such agniho- 
trim have become very rare and in certain parts of India one 
can hardly find a single agnihotrin keeping 6rauta fires even 
among thousands of brahmanas. 

Every one who has kindled ,614 the sacred fires has to offer 
every morning and evening the Agnihotra ( oblations of clari- 
fied butter ) in the srauta fires. Not only has one who has 
'consecrated the three sacred fires to offer agnihotra everyday, 
l but also every householder has to do so every day twice, in the 
; morning and in the" evening. Vide Manu IV. 25, Yaj. I. 99, 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 13. 22 and I. 4. 14. 1. 'For when a man is 
married, there are daily observances declared for him such as 
agnihotra, ( honouring ) guests and such other proper actions ' 
( Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 1 ). The rules about the proper time of 
kindling fire and offering oblations and about the material of 
the oblations are the same for grhya rites as in Srauta agnihotra 
( A&v. gr. I. 9. 4-6 }. The fire in which these daily offerings are 
made by one who has not kindled the three 6rauta fires is called 
aupasana, avasathya, aupasada, vaivahika or (-hana ), smarta or 
grhya or salagni. 1815 There are various views about the time 
from which this fire is to be maintained. The view of the vast 
majority of writers is that the grhya fire is the nuptial 'fire which 
is kindled on the day of marriage by the newly married pair. 
We saw above ( pp. 530, 557 ) that the My. gr. ( I. 8. 5 ) directs 
that when the bridegroom starts after marriage from the bride's 
house for his own house ( whether in the same village or in

vessel ( called ukha ) in front till he reaches his house. 1616 Vide 
also Ap. gr. V. 14-15. The Asv. gr. I. 9. 1-3 says ' beginning 
from the holding of the hand ( i. e. marriage ) he should worship 
bhe domestic fire himself or his wife, also his son or his 
laughter or pupil. 1617 The worship of fire should be constantly 
kept up'. A man's nuptial fire may go out and he may 
not re-instate it through neglect or other cause or his wife 
may be dead and he may remain a widower. In such case? he 
has to offer his daily offerings in the ordinary fire on which he 
cooks his food ( laukika or pacana fire ) ; so that so far Rve kinds 
of fires ( viz. the three srauta ones, aupasana or grhya and the 
laukika ) are spoken of. There is another fire called ' sabhya * 
[which is the sixth). According 1618 to Medhatithi on Manu III. 
185 the sabhya fire is that which is kept burning in the hall of a 
rich man for the removal of cold and for the diffusion of 
warmth. Vide Sat. Br. ( S. B. E. vol. 12, p. 302 n 1 ), where the 
translator says that the sabhya fire was kept only by ksatriyas. 
The Katyayana Srauta siltra IV. 9. 20 prescribes that the sabhya 
fire also is generated by friction like the Garhapatya fire. Ap. 
Sr. satra IV. 4. 7 says that the sabhya fire is to be kindled in 
bhe hall ( of gambling, according to the com. ) to the east of the 
place of the ahavanlya fire. The SmrfcyarthasSra (p. 14 ) lfilB 
says that a householder should maintain six fires, five, four, 
three, two or one, but should never remain without fire. When 
he keeps the treta, aupasana, sabhya and ordinary fire he will 
have six ; when he maintains the treta, aupasana and sabhya he 
(s called paiicagni, who is among the brahmanas that are pankti- 
pavanas ( i. e. that sanctify the company at dinner ). Vide 
Gkmt. 15. 29, Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 22, Vas. Dh. S. III. 19,

will have three, he who maintains aupasana and the ordinary 
fire will have two and one may only maintain the ordinary 
fire. The rites prescribed in 1620 the grhyasfltra of a person's 
6akha were to be performed in the aupasana ; other rites 
prescribed in the smrtis were to be performed in the ordinary 
fire. But if one has no fire other than the ordinary one, every 
rite has to performed in it. The under-lying idea of this 
emphasis on the worship of Agni seems to be that the oblations 
thrown into the fire reach the sun, that sends rain, from 
which springs corn, that is the sustenance of all beings. Vide 
Manu III. 76 ( = gantiparva 264. 11 ) and Sm. C. I. p. 155, 
Par. M. I, part I, p. 130 for the eulogy of agnihotra. 

There were other views about the time from which one was 
to begin keeping one's grhya fire. Gaut. V. 6, Yaj. I. 97, Par. 
gr. L 2 and others refer to an optional course viz. setting up the 
grhya fire at the time when one separates from other members 
of the family. The San. gr. I. 1. 2-5 refers to four alternatives 
in all ( including the two already referred to); the other two 
are : When 1821 a pupil is about to return from his teacher's 
home, he may keep as his grhya fire that fire on which he puts 
the last samidh ; or a person may, if he is the eldest son, keep 
the fire of his father on the latter's death or of his eldest brother 
on the latter's death ( if there is no division and the family 
continues joint ). Baud. gr. II. 6. 17 says 1622 that the grhya 
fire for a person is one by which his upanayana is performed, 
that from upanayana to samavartana the homa is performed 
only by uttering the vyahrtis acd with fuel sticks, from 
samavartana to marriage with vyahrtis and clarified butter, 
and from marriage onwards with offerings of boiled rice 
or barley.

Ch. XVII ] Ahnika-daily homa 681 

The deities to whom agnihotra is offered in the morning 
and evening are Agni and Prajapati ( to the latter inaudibly ). 
According to some in the morning the sun takes the place of 
Agni ( vide Baud. gr. II. 7. 21 quoted in n. 1622 Hir. gr. I. 26. 9, 
Bhar. gr. III. 3, Ap. gr. VII. 21 ). 

The oblations are to be made in the morning and evening of 
cooked food, but only such corn as is fit to be offered to fire as 
havis is to be used ( Asv. gr. I. 2. 1 ). It is either boiled rice or 
barley ( Ap. gr. VII. 19 ). ms Gobhila-smrti (1. 131 and III. 114) 
says 1624 that among havisyas the foremost are yavas ( barley ), 
then comes rice, but one should eschew m5sa, kodrava and 
gaura among corns even if nothing else is available, 
that if rice and barley are not available one may employ 
curds or milk or in their absence, yavagu ( gruel ) or 
water. According to a verse quoted by Narayana on Asv. gr. 
I. 9. 6 ten materials can be offered as havis into fire viz. milk, 
curds, yavagu, clarified butter, boiled rice, husked rice, soma % 
flesh, sesame oil and water. 1625 Manu III, 257 specifies some 
articles as naturally fit for being employed as havis. Vide also 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 12-14. Though flesh is allowed as offering 
in some sacrifices it cannot be employed in the morning and 
evening homa (vide Asv. gr. I. 9. 6 ). The general rule is that 
when no particular material is specified for homa into fire, 
clarified butter is to be used as offering, and when no particular 
deity is mentioned, then the deity is to be Prajapati 1626 . There 
is another rule that fluid materials are to be offered into fire 
with the sruva ladle, while solid havis is to be offered with the 
right hand 1687 .

682 History of DJiarmasastra [ Ch. XVII 

The Gobhila gr. (1. 1. 15-19) lays down that # one is to kindle 
one's grhya fire ( originally or if it goes out ) by bringing it from 
the house of a vaisya or from a frying pan or he may bring it 
from the house of a person who performs many sacrifices, 
whether he be a brahmana or rajanya or vaisya or one may 
produce it by attrition ; this last is holy, but does not bring pro- 
sperity. One may do as one likes im \ There are similar 
provisions in San. gr. 1. 1. 8, Par. gr. I, 2, Ap. gr. V. 16-17. If the 
grhya fire goes out, the husband or the wife has to observe a fast 
that day as a penance ( Ap. gr. V. 19 ). 

The fire in which oblations are to be offered must be fed by 
plenty of dry wood, must be well kindled and smokeless, the 
cinders must be red-hot and it must be flaming up I689 . The 
Chan. Up. V. 24. 1 indicates that oblations were to be offered 
only on red hot coals. The Mundaka Up. I. 2. 2 says the same. 
Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 5. 15. 18-21), Manu IV. 53 and others lay down 
that one should not come very near fire when one is not pure, 
one should not blow on fire with the mouth (to kindle it), 
nor should one place it under a cot &câ one should not throw 
anything impure in fire, nor should one warm ones feet over it, 
nor should one place it towards one's feet (when one is 
sleeping). Gobhilasmrti L 135-136 says that one should not 
blow on fire with the hand or a winnowing basket or a darvi 
(ladle), but one may use a fan; some blow on fire with the 
mouth because fire was produced from the mouth and construe 
the words ( of Manu IV. 53 ) ' one should not blow on fire with 
the mouth' as applicable to ordinary fire (i. e. one may blow 
with the mouth on 6rauta fires 163 Â°).

Ch. XVII ) Ahnika-daily homa 683 

The daily homa must be offered by the man himself and 
Daksa says that the merit secured by performing homa by one- 
self cannot be secured by getting it performed through another, 
but he adds that homa performed on one's behalf by a priest, by 
one's son, teacher, brother, sister's son, or son-in-law is equivalent 
to homa made by oneself. l631 We saw above ( v. 1617 ) that the 
Asv. gr, ( 1. 9. 1 ) allows the wife, a son, an unmarried daughter or 
a pupil of the householder to attend to the worship of the house- 
holder's grhya fire. San. gr. II. 17. 3 is to the same effect. The 
Smrtyarthasara (p. 34) adds that the wife and the daughter 
should perform all the acts in homa except paryuksana. Ap. 
Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 15-16 l632 and Manu XL 36-37 lay down'that the 
wife, an unmarried daughter, a young married daughter, one 
who has studied little, a stupid person, a diseased person or one 
whose upanayana has not been performed should not offer 
agnihotra ( on behalf of the householder); if they do so, they 
and he both fall into hell ; therefore the person to offer agni- 
hotra for another should be one proficient in Srauta sacrifices 
and master of the Vedas. These passages have been explained 
by the Sm. 0. (I. p. 161 ) and other writers as applicable to the 
performance of 6rauta sacrifices only ; while as regards the daily 
homa in the grhya fire the wife and others specified by A6v. are 
held to be competent if the sacrificer is ill or has gone abroad. 
Haradatta (on Asv. gr. I. 9. 1-2) says that either the husband or 
the wife must always be near the grhya fire. 1633 Laghu-Asva- 
layana (L 69) says that one who has kindled the grhya fire should 
not leave the boundary of his village without his wife, as the 
texts lay down that homa is to be performed in the place where 
the wife stays. A brahmana 1624 may go abroad on business, 
leaving his fire in charge of his wife and after appointing a 
priest ; but he should not stay away long without cause. A 
priest should not offer homa on behalf of a householder, when 
both the spouses are absent, beoause such homa by him in the

absence of both is useless. 1655 If an householder has several 
wives of the same caste or wives of different castes, the texts 
lay down who is to be associated with him in religious rites- 
These rules have already been set out above (pp. 559-60). 'When a 
householder's wife dies he should not give up his Vedic fires, but 
that ( i. e. the Agnihotra ) should be performed till one's life 
by means of an upadhi ( i. e. by marrying another savarna 
wife or by associating with himself an asavarna wife ) ' says 
Gobhila smrti 1636 III. 9. Gobhila then refers to the story of 
Rama, who performed sacrifices with a golden image of his 
discarded wife Slta kept by his side. In spite of Gobhila's 
dictum, allowing a golden image or a kusa representative of 
an absent or dead wife, Apararka condemns the practice as 
opposed to the rule laid down by Satyasadha in his srauta 
sutra ' ' there 1527 is no pratinidhi (representative or substitute) 
in the case of the owner ( i. e. yajamana ), the wife, the son, 
the ( proper ) place and time ( for an act ), fire, the deity ( to be 
invoked ), of a rite and of a text ( directed to be employed in 
a rite ). * His argument is that the wife's co-operation is 
required in such actions as looking at the clarified butter, in 
unhusking grains &c. and as an image of kusa or gold cannot 
perform these acts, the image cannot be employed in place of 
the wife. The Sm. C. replies to this argument by saying that 
the words of Satyasadha have reference only to a human 
substitute for a wife and that other smrtis allow a substitute made 
of gold or kusa. For example, Vrddha-Harlta 16 * 8 expressly pres- 
cribes that a man may perform agnihotra and the offering of the 
five daily sacrifices throughout his life in the company of 
his wife's image made of kusa grass (if the wife be dead 
&c, ). If a person loses his wife or if he goes abroad or

becomes patita his agnihotra may be continued by his son m9 
( AJ;ri, verse 108). The Ait. Br. ( 32. 8 ) also says that even one 
who has lost his wife (or who has no wife) should perform 
agnihotra, as the Veda orders a man to offer sacrifice. mo 

Not kindling Vedic fires when one was competent to do so 
and giving up 6rauta and smarta fires were looked upon as 
upapatakas by Yaj. III. 234, 239, Visnu Dh. S. 37, 28 and 54. 13. 
The Vas. Dh. S. III. 1 says ,641 that those who do not study or 
teach the Veda or who do not maintain the sacred fires become 
equal to sudras. Gargya as quoted in the Sm. C. (I. p. 156) 
avers that if a dvija remains after marriage without fires even 
for a moment ( when he has the power and authority to 
maintain them ) he becomes a vrctttja and patita. The Mun- 
daka Up. I. 2. 3 declares that if a person fails to perform 
the Darsa-Purnamasa and other sacrifices and Vaisvadeva, his 
seven holy worlds are destroyed. The Tai. S. I. 5. 2. 1 and the 
Kathaka S. IX. 2, declare 'He who makes the (sacred) fires go 
out (be extinguished) is indeed a killer of a hero in the eyes of 
the gods and brahmanas who are anxiously devoted to rta 
( righteousness or correct order ) did not formerly eat food 
at his house \ 

The texts ( such as Yaj. I. 99 ) prescribe japa ( muttering of 
Gayatrl and other holy Vedic mantras ) as part of samdhya 
adoration. This has been already referred to above (p. 313 ). Yaj. 
I. 99 speaks of japa (of verses addressed to the Sun) after morning 
homa and then in 1. 101 again prescribes japa after the midday 
bath of philosophical texts ( like the Upanisads, as stated in 
Gaut. 19. 12 and Vas. Dh. S. 22. 9 ). Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 are 
verses which mention several hymns principally of the 
Rgveda, by reciting which ( inaudibly ) several times a man 
becomes pure. These verses occur in Sankhasmrti chap. XI 
( with some variations ) and in Visnu Dh. S. 56 (in prose). Some

of these Vedic texts are well known, such as Aghamarsana 
( Rg. X. 190. 1-3 ), PavamanI verses ( Rg. IX ), 6atarudriya 
( Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11 ), Trisuparpa ( Tai. Lx. X. 48-50 ) &c. 
Manu II. 87, Vas. 26. 11, Sankhasmrti XII. 28, Visnu Dh. 
S. 55. 21 say that a brahmana attains the highest perfection by 
japa alone, even if he does not do anything else. Gobhila 
smrfci II. 17 says that one should inaudibly repeat as much of 
the Veda from the beginning as one can and that japa may be 
performed before tarparia or after the morning homa or at the 
end of vaisvadeva and that it constitutes brahmayajiia ( II. 
28-29 ). Visnu Dh. S. (64. 36-39) avers that japa should comprise 
sacred hymns, particularly the Gayatrl and Purusasukta, as 
nothing else is superior to these. 1642 Japa is of three kinds, 
vaclka ( audibly uttered ), upamsu ( inaudibly uttered ) and 
manasa ( mentally revolved ), each succeeding one being ten 
times superior to each preceding one (Laghu-Harlta ms chap. IV, 
p. 186, Jivananda I ). Vide Manu II. 85 ( = Vas. 26. 9, 
Sankha XII. 29 ). Japa is one of the removers of sin ( Gaut. 
19. 11 ). Japa is to be performed sitting on a seat of kusa 
grass, either in the house, or on a river bank, or in a cowpen, 
or in a fire room or at tlrthas or before images of gods or 
before an image of Visnu, each succeeding place being many 
times superior to each preceding one. m4 One is not to 
speak while engaged in japa. A brahmacarl or a householder 
who has consecrated sacred fires should mutter the Gayatrl 
108 times, while a vunaprastha and yati should repeat it more 
than 1000 times. Vide Manu II. 101 also about the extent 
of the time to be devoted to japa. When in the middle ages 
Vedic learning declined and Puranas came to the fore, the 
writers of the digests stated that one who has studied the whole 
Veda should repeat daily from the beginning of the Veda as 
much as he could ; if one has studied only a portion of the Veda, 
then one should recite in his japa the Purusasukta ( Rg. X 90) 
and similar hymns and a brahmana who knows only the

Gayatrl should repeat the texts of the puranas. ,845 Vrddha- 
Harlta( VI. 33,45, 163, 213) prescribes that the mantra of 6 
letters (om namo Visnave), eight letters ( om namo Vasudevaya ) 
or of twelve letters ( om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya ) should 
be repeated 1008 or 108 times. The counting of the mantra 
as repeated so many times has to be done by means of one's 
ringers ( except the thumb ) or by drawing lines (on the ground 
or walls &c. ), or by telling the beads of a rosary, as japa 
without counting the number is fruitless I848 . Sankha-smrti 
(chap. XII. in prose) lays down that the rosary should have beads 
of gold or precious stones or pearls or. crystal or rudraksa, padma- 
ksa (lotus seed) or putrajlvaka or a man may count by knots 
of kusa grass or by bending the fingers of the left hand. im 
Brhat-Parasara V. p. 85 and Laghu-Vyasa ( Jivananda part II. 
p. 375 ) contain similar provisions about aksamala and counting 
of japa. They add * indraksa ' to the different kinds of beads. The 
rosary should have 108 beads (this is the best) or 54 (middling) or 
27 (this is the lowest number of beads in a rosary). 1648 Kalidasa 
(in his Raghuvamsa XL 66) mentions that the hero Parasurama 
had on his right ear a rosary of aksa seeds, Bana ( Kadambarl 
para 37 ) speaks of counting by means of rings of rudraksas. 
Vide Sm. C. I. pp. 152-153, Par. M. I. part I, pp. 308-311, 
Madanaparijata p. 80, Ahnikaprakasa pp. 326-328 for further 
details about the rosary. 

After homa and japa one may spend some time in attending 
to or looking at auspicious things, such as seeing one's elders, 
looking at a mirror or in clarified butter, arranging and 
decorating his hair, applying collyrium to the eye, touching

durva 164 * &c. Vide Manu IV. 152 quoted above (p, 646). What 
objects a man should see on getting up has already been stated 
(p. 648). According to Narada ( praklrnaka vv. 54-55 ) there are 
eight mangala objects viz. a brahmana, a cow, fire, gold, clarified 
butter, the sun, water and the king and if one sees, bows to or 
circumambulates these, one's life is lengthened. 1850 The 
Vamana-purana ( 14. 35-37 ) mentions numerous objects that 
are auspicious and that one should touch or see before going 
out. 1851 The MatsyapurSna 243 enumerates in 26 verses 
numerous auspicious and inauspicious objects ( these are quoted 
in Gr. R. pp. 553-554 ). Visnu Dh. S. 23. 58 enumerates six 
objects derived from the cow as auspicious. Vide Adiparva 
29. 34, Dronaparva 127. 14 ( for touching eight mangalas ), 
Santi 40.7, Anusasana 126.18 and 131. 8. According to the 
Visnu Dh. S. 63. 26 one should start on a journey after seeing 
such objects as fire, a brahmana, hetaera, a jar full of water, a 
mirror, a banner, a parasol, palaces, fans, chowries &c. Visnu 
Dh. S. 63. 27-31 states that when, on leaving one's house, one 
sees certain persons or objects one should return to the house 
and then restart viz. a drunkard, a lunatic, a cripple, one who 
has vomited or has undergone a purge, one who is completely 
shaved, one with dirty clothes, one having matted hair, a 
dwarf, one wearing orange-coloured clothes, an ascetic &c. 

The performance of the duties of sauoa, dantadhavana, 
snana, samdhya, homa, japa would occupy the first of the eight 
parts of the day. In the second ,652 part of the day a brahmana 
householder was to go over and to revise his Vedic studies and 
to collect fuel sticks, flowers, kusa &c. (Daksa II. 33, 35, 
Yaj. I. 99). This subject of Veda study has already been dealt 
with above (pp. 351-354). In the third part of the day the

householder was to work and find out the means of maintaining 
those dependent on him ( Daksa IL 35 ). The different ways of 
maintaining oneself in the case of brahmanas have already been 
spoken of above ( pp. 105-134). Gaut. IX. 63, Yaj. I. 100, Manu 
IV. 33, Visnu 63. 1 and others say that a brahmana householder 
should approach a king or other rich person for the wherewithal 
to maintain hia family. The persons whom every one must 
maintain have already been pointed out on p. 569 (Daksa II. 36)' 
In the case of the well-to-do, there are other persons who should 
be maintained viz. agnates and cognates, one who is without 
means, helpless or has taken shelter ,65S . In this world only 
that man may be said to live on whom many depend for their 
livelihood; other men who only fill their own belly are really 
dead, though living ( Daksa II. 40 ). 

In the fourth part mi of the day (i. e. before noon) one was 
to have the mid-day bath (with tarpana) and then the mid-day 
samdhya prayer and devapuja &c. (Daksa II. 43 and Yaj. I. 100). 
Those who bathe twice (in the morning and at noon) will 
strictly follow the routine sketched above in Daksa, Yaj. and 
others. But most of the brahmanas bathe only once either in the 
morning or before noon. The principal matters to be described 
in connection with the bath before noon are tarparux of gods, 
sages and pitrs ; devapuja and the five daily yajiias. These will 
now be described in detail. 

Tarpana â (satiating by offering water). As stated in 
Manu II. 176, every day one has to perform tarpana of gods, 
sages and pitrs. The water to be offered to gods is poured by 
that part of the right hand which is called devatlrtha and that 
for the pitrs by the pitr-tlrtha. A person was to perform tarpana 
according to the grhyasutra of the Vedic sakha which he or his 
ancestors studied. There is a good deal of divergence among 
the several grhyasufcras. Here the procedure of tarpana prescribed

by the Aiv. gr. ( III. 4. 1-5 ) will be first; set out. In the 
Devatatarpana the following deities are enumerated and one 
has to add the words ' trpyatu \ ' trpyetam ', or ' trpyantu ' with 
each devata according as it is one deity, two deities or more 
and offer water to each (e. g. ' Prajapatis-trpyatu, Brahma 

trpyatu, Dyavaprthivl trpyetam * &c. ). The deities are 31 

viz. Prajapati, BrahmS, Vedas, devas, rsis, all metres, omkfira, 
vasa^kSra, vyahrtis, the Gayatrl, sacrifices ( yajfias ), heaven 
and earth, the air (antariksa), days and nights, the S&nkhyas, 
siddhas, oceans, the rivers, the mountains, the fields, herbs, 
trees, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, birds, cows, sadhyas, 
vipras, yaksas, the raksases, the bhfttas (beings) that have 
these ( raksas ) at the end. In modern times the fields, herbs, 
trees, Gandharvas and Apsarases are put in one compound word 
and form only one devata, while after bhutas there is a separate 
deity ' evam-antani trpyantu \ Hacadatta on A6v. gr. III. 3. 2 
refers to the view of some that take ' evam-antSni' as a separate 
mantra but his opinion was that the phrase ' evam-antani * only 
described the preceding devatas and that the devatas stopped 
at ' raksamsi \ He further adds that the tarpana to these was 
done by the prajapatya tlrtha (of the hand). 

The sages to whom water is offered are divided into two 
groups. The first group contains twelve sages and when offer- 
ing water to these the sacred thread is worn in the nivlta form. 
The twelve sages are those of the hundred rks, the middle rsis 
( i. e, of mandalas 2 to 9 of the Rgveda), Grtsamada, ViÂ£varaitra, 
Vamadeva, Atri, Bharadvaja, Vasistha, Pragathas, the PavamanI 
hymns, sages of the short hymns and those of the long 
hymns (the tarpana formula will be ' satarcinas-trpyantu, 
m&dhyam5s-trpyantu, Grtsamadas-trpyantu &c). It will be 
noticed that the sages from Grtsamada to Vasistha are the seers 
of mandalas 2 to 7 of the Bgveda. The Pragathas stand for the 
Bighth mandala of which the first hymn is ascribed in the 
Anukramani to Pragatha of the Kanva got*a and the rest of 
the eighth mandala is ascribed to various scions of the Kanva 
gotra. The verses of the ninth mandala are called Pavaraanyah ; 
but as it is a tarpana of sages, we rather expect the form pava- 
manah as in the Sankhyayana grhya IV, 10. 'Sataroinah 1 refers 
to the sages of the first mandala, and 'ksudrasuktah' and 
1 mahasuktah* to sages of the tenth mandala. Water is offered to 
these sages by the daiva tlrtha. Then there is a second group of 
â ages to whom water is offered by a person who wears his sacred 



Ch. XVII] Ahrrika-tarpana 691 

thread in the praclnavlfca form (i. e. it is suspended over the right 
shoulder and under the left arm). There are two sub-groups here. 
In the first the verbal forms ' trpyantu ' or ' trpyatu ' are used 
with the nominative of the words for the sage ; i. e. ' Sumantu- 
Jaimini-Vaisampayana-Paila-sutra-bhasya-Bharata-Mahabha- 
rata-Dharmacary as trpyantu'; 1655 * Jananti-Bahavi-Gargya-Gau- 
tama-Sakalya-Babhravya-Mandavya-Mandukeyas trpyantu '; 
' Gargl-Vaoaknavl trpyatu, Vadava-Pratitheyl trpyatu, Sula- 
bha-Maitreyl trpyatu \ These together are five sentences. It 
is remarkable that in this list three women are mentioned as 
sages ( Gargl, Vadava and Sulabha ). Among the other sages 
the first four are frequently mentioned in the Mahabharata as 
the pupils of Vyasa who taught them the Vedas (vide 
Sabhaparva 4. 11 and Santi 328. 26-27 where all four are 
named ). For chronological purposes it is important to note 
that the A6v. gr. knew teachers of sutras, bhasyas, of the 
Bharata and also the Mahabharata and of Dharma. In the 
second sub-group there are 17 single sages and the 18th is a 
miscellaneous offering to all other acaryas. The names of the 
17 sages occur in the accusative and after each the word 
â¢ tarpayami ' is to be uttered ( i. e. Kaholam tarpayami, KausI- 

takam tarpayami A^valayanam tarpayami). These 17 sages 

are : Kahola, Kausltaka, Mahakausltaka, Paingya, Mahapaingya, 
Suyajiia, Sankhyayana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Sakala, jBaskalai 
Sujatavaktra, Audavahi, Mahaudavahi, Saujami, Saunaka, 
A^valayana. The 18th is ' may all the other acaryas be satiated' 
( ye canye acaryas-te sarve trpyantu ). All these sages are 
connected with the Rgveda, its Brahmanas, its Aranyakas and 
other related works like the Pratteakhya sutra ( of which 
Saunaka is said to be the author ). It is interesting to note 
that AÂ§valayana himself is named as the last teacher in tarpana. 
Saunaka is said to be the teacher of A&valayana. 1858 In modern 
times in the Deocan water is offered twice to each sage or group 
of sages. 

Asv. gr. III. 4. 5 is very brief as to pitrfcarpana * after satiat- 
ing the pitrs with water, each generation separately, he returns 
to his house and whatever he gives then becomes the fee 1 (of the

dampSyana and Paila wore along with Suka, tho son of VySsa, the pupiU

Brahmayajfia of which tarpana is a constituent part). In 
modern times the deceased ancestors and relatives to whom 
water is offered are stated below. Water is offered to each thrice 
(except to women ancestors other than the mother, grand-mother 
and the great-grandmother ) by the pitr-tlrtha and the rela- 
tionship, the gotra and the name of each are recited when 
doing so. For example, water is offered to the deceased father 
in the form, ' I offer svadha and bow to and satiate my father, 
so and so by name, whose gotra was so and so and who has 
attained the form of Vasu' ( asmatpitaram amukasarmanam 
arnuka-gotram vasurupam svadhanamas tarpayami). The ances- 
tors and relatives to whom water is offered, if they are dead, are 
in order :â ^father, paternal grandfather and great-grandfather; 
mother, paternal grand-mother and great-grandmother; step- 
mother; maternal grand-father (with maternal gTand-mother, 
sapatnlkam being used with ' matamaham ' ), maternal great- 
grand-father and maternal great-great-grand-father (with their 
wives); one's wife; one's son (or sons, if several are dead 
already and with his wife or their wives that are dead); daughter 
(with her husband, if both are dead); uncle (with his wife, if 
dead); maternal uncle (with his wife, if dead); brother (with 
wife); paternal aunt (with husband); maternal aunt (with 
husband ); sister (with husband); father-in-law (with his wife 
and son, if they are dead); guru (father as teacher of the 
Gay atrl and Veda) ; pupil. In the case of grand-fathers and 
grand-mothers they are described as 'rudrarupa' and the great- 
grand-fathers and great-grand-mothers as 'adityarupa*. The 
three ancestors of the mother with their wives are respectively 
vasurupa, rudrarupa and adityarupa 1857 . The names of women 
ancestors have the affix 'da' added and all persons both male and 
female other than those specified above are described as 
' vasurupa \ 

A few points of divergence will be noticed. Haradatta on 
Asv. gr. III. 3. 6 notes that some do not include the mother and 
maternal relations in the daily tarpana, and that according to 
the established practice in his day the tarpana formulae did not 
include the names and the gotra of the relatives. Most sutras 

16f>7. Vide Manu III. 2S4 for the temis Vasurupa, Kudrarupa and 
XdityarGpa. f^^T on 3TfÂ«*. aj. III. 3. 6 says * m%o\T ffnrraw^M HRTTTOT- 



Cb . XV LI ] Ahmka-tarpava 693 

do not say that the names and gotras of the relatives are to be 
repeated in daily tarpana. The words 'svadha namas' do not 
occur in many sutras, but some do contain them (e. g. Baud. Db. 
S. II. 5. 1 84 ff., Vaik. 1. 4). The devatas of tarpana differ in each 
sutra. The San. gr. ( IV. 9 ) which belongs to the Rgveda just as 
A6valayana's does, enumerates the deities differently in the 
beginning (it has Agni,Vayu,Surya, Visnu,Prajapati, Virupaksa, 
Sahasraksa &c). Its order of sages is" 5 somewhat different and 
it adds some names such as Sakapuni, Gautami &c. The Baud, 
Dh. S. II. 5 contains the most elaborate tarpana of all sutras. 
It puts ' om ' before each devata, rsi and pitr. It includes not 
only many more deities than elsewhere, but includes several 
names of the same deity ( e. g. Vinayaka, Vakratunda, Hasti- 
mukha, Ekadanta ; Yama, Yamaraja, Dharma, Dharmaraja, 
Kala, NUa, Vaivasvata &c). Among rsis it includes many 
sutrakaras like Kanva, Baudhayana, Apastamba, Satyasadha, 
and also Yajiiavalkya, Vyasa. The Hir. gr. II. 19. 20, Baud. gr. 
III. 9, Bharadvaja gr. III. 9-11 contain long and interesting 
lists of deities and particularly of sages. 

If a man has no time for this lengthy tarpana the Dharma- 
sindau and other digests prescribe an extremely brief one, viz. 
he repeats two verses and offers water thrice. The verses are 
' may the gods, sages, pitrs/human beings, from Brahma up to a 
blade of grass, be satiated and also all the pitrs, the mother 
and the maternal grand-father and the rest, may this water 
mixed with sesame be for the crores of families of bygone 
ages residing in the seven dvlpas from the world of Brahma 
downwards \ 

The Snanasiitra (3rdkandika) of Katyayana attached to 
the Par. gr. contains a description of tarpana. Like the Baud. 
Dh. S. it lays down that 'om' is to be uttered before the 
name of every deity ( devata ) and * trpyatam ' ( or trpyantam if 
the word denoting the deity is in the plural ) is the verbal form 
employed. The deities are only 23 and slightly differ from 
those of Asv. The group of sages is made up of only Sanaka, 
Sanandana, Sanatana, Kapila, Asuri, Vodhu, and Pancasikha 
(Kapila, Asuri and Paiicasikha are according to the Sankhya- 
karika the names of the founders of the Sahkhya philosophy 
and stand in the relation of teacher and pupil). Then (after 
the rsitarpana ), the householder is to mix sesame in water and 
wear the sacred thread under the left arm and suspend it from 
the right shoulder and offer the water to Kavyavad Anala 



694 History of DharmaiUstra [ Oh. XVII 

(fire), Soma, Yaraa, Aryaman, Agnisvattas, Somapas, Barhi- 
sads m *. Offerings of water mixed with sesame are to be made 
thrice to each of the above with joined hands (jalaiijali) and 
this is to be done by all householders oven if the father be 
living. The remaining part of tarpana ( viz. pitrtarpana ) is to 
be done only by him whose father is dead. Gobhila-smrti II. 
18-20, Matsyapurana 102. 14-21 are very similar to the Snana- 
sutra. According to Asvalayana and others water is offered with 
the right hand only while according to Katyayana and others 
water is offered with both hands. 1689 The Sm. C. I. p. 191 says that 
the householder should follow his grhyasutra and if there is 
nothing in it on this point there is an option. Karsnajini pre- 
scribes that in sraddha and marriage only the right hand is 
employed in making an offering or gift, but in tarpana both 
hands ( made into an an jali ) are employed. One 1660 anjali of 
water is offered to each of the gods, two to Sanaka and other 
sages and three to each of the pitrs. When tarpana is performed 
while the householder is still in the water with his wet clothes 
on, he offers the water in the stream itself ; but when he wears 
dry clothes and performs tarpana, then he is to let fall the 
handfuls of water in a pure vessel of gold, silver, copper, 
bronze, but not in an earthen one ; or he may let the water fall 
on the r,*ound covered with kusas ( Sm. C. I. p. 192 ). There 
were several views on this point (vide Gr, R. pp. 263-264). 
In modern times daily tarpana has become very rare. Only a 
few even among the orthodox or priestly brahmanas and among 
those who have studied the several sastras ( such as grammar 

1658. Yoga-Ysjtiavalkya quoted by Aparaika pp. 138-139 gives the 
game names of devatSs and of the divine pitrs as the Snanasntra. Vide

pitarah). Vide Sabhffparva 11. 45 for seven groups (ganas) of pitrs, 
four of whom are said to be corpore&l and three disembodied. Kffrspa-i 
jini quoted by AparSrka p. 138 says that the seven sages from Sanaka 
to Panca^ikha are the sons of BrahmB.

&c.) do it daily, but generally most brahmanas perform tarpana 
as part of brahmayajna on one day in the year in the month 
of Sravana. 

A special tarpana was offered to Yama on the 14th of the 
dark half of a month if it was a Tuesday or on the 14th of 
the daik half. Vide Sm. 0. I. pp. 197-198, Madanaparijata 
p. 296, Par. M. I. part 1, p. 361. Daksa ( II. 52-55 ) prescribes 
that Yama-fcarpana is specially performed in the Jumna on the 
days specified above and gives the several names under which 
Yama is invoked. Vide also Matsyapurana 213. 2-8. The Tai. 
Ar. VI. 5 speaks of a yajfia or bali ( offering ) in honour of 
Yama every month. There is also tarpana in honour of the 
great epio hero Bhlsraa offered on the 8th of the bright half of 
Magha. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 198. 

Gobhila-smrfci 16M ( II. 22-23 ) emphasizes the importance 
of tarpana by remarking that, as all beings, animate or inani- 
mate, desire water from the brahmana who brings prosperity to 
all, tarpana should always be done by him and that if he does 
not do it he would incur great sin and that if he does it he 
would support this world. The idea underlying tarpana seems 
to be indicated even by the Tai. S. V. 4. 4. l. ,m 

Ifc has already been seen ( at pp. 668-669 ) that tarpana was 
prescribed as an appendage of the early morning bath and that 
some required it to be done twice daily while others said that it 
was to be done only once. As Asv. gr. places tarpana immediately 
after svadhyaya (or brahmayajna) it follows fchat he treated it as a 
constituent though subordinate part of it. The Gobhilasmrti 
( II. 29 ) says that brahmayajna which consists in inaudibly 
muttering Vedic texts (japa) should be performed before tarpana 
or after the morning homa or at the end of Vaisvadeva and at 
no other time unless there is some special reason. 1663 

The Ahnikaprakasa (pp. 336-377) gives summaries of tar- 
pana according to Katyayana, Sankha, Baudhayana, Visnu- 
purana, Yogiyajnavalkya, Asvalayana, Gobhilagrhya.

CHAPTER XVIII 

PANCA MAHAYAJNAS 

Pafica Mahayajnas;â ( the five daily great observances or 
sacrifices ). 

From early Vedic times five daily observances called 
mahayajnas were prescribed. The Sat. Br. ( XI 5. 6. I. ) l664 says 
* there are only five mahayajnas, they are like great sacrificial 
sessions, viz. the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the 
sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to 
brahman (Veda)'. These are then briefly defined. In the Tai. 
Ar. II. 10 we read * these five mahayajnas indeed are spread out 
continuously, viz. devayajiia, pitryajna, bbufeayajfia, manusya- 
yajiia, brahmayajna. That is fulfilled as devayajiia when one 
makes an offering in fire, even if it be a mere fuel-stick; when 
one offers svadha ( Sraddha repast ) to the fathers, even if it be 
mere water, that becomes pitryajna; when a man offers a ball 
( a ball of food) to the beings ifc becomes bhufcayajna, when he 
gives food to brahmanas that becomes manusyayajna. When 
one studies svadhyaya even if it be a single rk or yajus formula 
or a saman t ifc becomes brahmayajna \ ,865 

TheAsv.gr. (Ill 1.1-4) speaks of the five mahayajnas 
and defines them in practically the same words as the Tai. Ar. 
II. 10 and enjoins that those yajfias must be performed every- 
day. Narfiyana on Asv. gr. III. 1. 2 expressly asserts that the

Ch. XVIII ] Paflca-Mahayajfias 697 

basis of the five yajrlas is the Tai. Ar. 106<J The Ap. Dh. S. 
( I. 4. 12. 13-15 and I 4. 13. 1 ) names and explains them simi- 
larly and states that they are called ( in the Tai. Ar. II. 10 ) 
' great yajfias ' and ' great sacrificial sessions' by way of lauda- 
tion. The word * yajfia * applied to these five daily duties is 
figurative and the adjective ' great ' is applied only for belaud- 
ing 1667 them. Gaut. V. 8 and VIII. 17, Baud. Dh. S. II. 6. 1-8, 
Gobhilasmrti II. 26 and numerous smrfci texts speak of the same 
five yajfias. Gaut. VIII. 17 includes them among saniskaras as 
stated above ( p. 193 ). 

It will be noticed from the description of the five yajfias 
given below that they are distinguished from the solemn srauta 
sacrifices in two respects. In these five the chief agent is the 
householder himself, he does not need the help and ministration 
of a professional priest, while in the srauta sacrifices the 
priests occupy the most prominent place and the householder is 
more or less a passive spectator or agent in the hands of the 
priests who direct everything. In the second place, in the five 
yajfias the central point is the discharge of duties to the Creator, 
to the ancient sages, to the Manes, and to the whole universe with 
myriads of creatures of various grades of intelligence. In the 
srauta sacrifices the main-spring of action is the desire to secure 
Heaven or some object such as prosperity, a son &c. Therefore 
the institution of the five sacrifices is morally and spiritually 
more progressive and more ennobling than that of the Srauta 
sacrifices. 

The sentiments that prompted the performance of these Rye 
observances appear to have been as follows: Every man 
could not afford to celebrate the solemn srauta rites prescribed in 
the Brahmanas and Srauta sutras. But every one could offer a 
fuel-stick to fire that was deemed to be the mouth of the

great Gods m8 of Heaven and thus show his reverence and 
devotion to them. Similarly everyone could show his reverence 
for and gratitude to the great sages that had bequeathed a glorious 
heritage of sacred literature by repeating at least one verse 
and one could propitiate his deceased ancestors by offering in 
loving memory and filial devotion a mere handful or vessel-ful 
of water (which costs nothing). The whole world human and 
non-human is one creation and there must be a spirit of live 
and let live or give and take. Therefore one must offer what 
one can afford to a guest and also have something for all beings 
(including even such shunned animals as dogs, crows and 
insects). These feelings of devotion, gratitude, reverence, 
loving memory, kindliness and tolerance seem to have been 
the springs that prompted the Aryans of old to emphasize the 
importance of the five daily yajnas and to have led sutra 
writers like Gautama and legislators like Manu (11.28) to 
look upon them as sarhskaras, as ennobling the soul by freeing 
it from mere selfishness and elevating the body to become a fit 
vehicle for higher things. ,m Later on it appears that other 
purposes came to be attributed to the institution of the five daily 
yajnas. According to Manu III. 68-71, Visnu Dh. S. 59. 19-20, 
Sankha V. 1-2, Harlta, Matsyapurana 52. 15-16 and others 
every householder causes injury or death to sentient beings 
every day in five places, viz. the hearth, the grinding mill, 
broomstick, winnowing basket and similar household gear, 
mortar and pestle, and water-jar. The five daily yajnas were 
devised by the great sages as atonements for the sins arising 
from these five sources of injury to life. These five are : brah- 
5 mayajfia which consists in the study and teaching of the Veda, 
pitryajna which consists of tarparia* daivayajiia which consists 
in offerings made into fire, bhutayajfia which is offering obla- 
tions to beings and manusyayajiia which consists in honouring 
guests. He who performs these daily according to his means is 
never tainted by the sin of the injuries arising from the five 
places mentioned above. Manu ( III. 73-74 ) further mo ^ys 
that former sages had a different nomenclature for the five

yajiias i. e. ahuta, huta, prahuta, brahmya-huta and prUiita % 
which were the same respectively as japa ( or brahmayajna ), 
homa ( devayajna ), bhutayajna, manusyayajna and pitrtarpana 
( pitryajfia ). In the Atharvaveda VI. 71. 2 four out of these 
seem to be alluded to ' what came to me as huta or ahuta or 
given by pitrs and assented to by men \ l671 Huta and prahuta 
in the sense of homa to gods and ball to bhutas occur in Br. Up. 
I. 5.2. But in some grhyasutras different meanings are attached 
to these very words e. g. San. gr. I. 5 and Par. gr. I. 4 say that 
there are four pakayajnas viz. huta, ahuta, prahuta and prasita 
and San. gr. 1. 10. 7 m2 explains that they are respectively the 
same as agnihotra ( or daivayajria ), bali ( bhutayajna ), pitr- 
yajfia and brahmya-huta (or manusyayajna). The Harlta- 
dharma-sutra has a very interesting passage on this point. * We 
shall now explain the sunas (places of injury) which are so called 
because they kill moving and immovable sentient beings. 
They are five. The first ( suna ) is caused by actions like 
sudden entrance in water, plunging into water, whirling water, 
splashing it in various directions, taking water without 
straining it through a piece of cloth and driving vehicles ; the 
seoond by walking about in the dark or away from the beaten 
path or in quick jerks or by treading upon insects &c. ; the third 
by striking ( a tree with an axe &c. ), by plucking flowers &c. 
by tying with a rope &c, by crushing (in a mortar), by splitting 
( wood &c. ) ; the fourth by cutting crops, by rubbing or 
grinding ; and the fifth by ignition ( of fire-wood ), heating ( of 
water ), by roasting, frying and cooking. These five injuries 
that lead to Hell are committed every day by people. Brahma- 
carins get rid of the first three by attending on fire and on their 
teacher and by the study of the Veda ; householders and forest 
hermits purify themselves from these five by performing the 
five yajiias ; ascetics get rid of the first two injuries by sacred 
knowledge and contemplation, but the injury caused by crashing 
i cooked seeds under the teeth cannot be removed by any of 
these \ ,m Although in the Ap. Dh. S. snd others the five yajnas 
are enumerated in the order of bhuta-yajfia, manusya-yajiia,

devayajna, pitryajfia and svadhyaya, still the proper order from 
the point of view of the times of performance is first brahmayajna 
( japa &c. ), then devayajna, then bhutayajfia, then pitryajfia, 
and lastly manusyayajfia. im Therefore they will be dealt 
with in the same order here. But some matters have first 
to be noted. Various views were entertained about the time 
and nature of brahmayajna ,C75 and pitryajfia. According to 
Gobhila-smrti II. 28-29 quoted above (n. 1663), japa prescribed in 
sarhdhya adoration may be looked upon as brahmayajna, that 
the latter may be performed before tarpana and after the morning 
homa or after vaisvadeva. Narayana on Asv. gr. III. 2. 1 says 
that brahmayajna may be performed before or after vaisvadeva. 
According to the Snanasutra of Katyayana, brahmayajna 
precedes tarpana and Asv. gr. as stated above ( p. 695 ) appears 
to regard tarpana as part of it. Manu III. 82 ( Visnu Dh. S. 67. 
23-25) enjoins upon a man the performance of daily sraddha with 
food or water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus to propi- 
tiate and please the Manes of his deceased ancestors ; while 
Manu ( III. 70 and 283 ) says that tarpana ( done after bath ) 
constitutes pitryajfia. Therefore Gobhila says that sraddha, 
tarpana and the ball offered to pitrs constitute pitryajfia and 
even when one of them is gone through, the performance of 
pitryajfia is effected and it is not necessary to perform all 
three. 167fi In the bali-harana ( described below ) the remnants 
of bali are offered to pifcrs ( Asv. gr. I. 2. 11, Manu III. 91 ). 

Brahma-yajna. Probably the earliest description of this is 
to be found in the Sat. Br. XL 5. 6. 3-8. That Brahmana, after 
stating that brahmayajna is one's own daily study of the Veda, 
compares several elements required in the ordinary sacrifice to 
certain elements of brahmayajna, viz. the juhu spoon, upabhrfc, 
dhruva, sruva, avabhrtha ( the solemn bath at the end of a 
sacrifice ) and heaven are said to be represented by the speech, 
the mind, the eye, mental power, truth and the conclusion ( that

are present in brahmayajiia ). im Then it says that 'whoever 
studies day by day his Vedic lessons gains an imperishable 
world which is thrice or more of the world that one may secure 
by making a gift to priests of the whole earth replete with 
wealth. Then 4-7 compare rk, yajus, saman and Atharvangiras 
( Atharvaveda ) texts respectively to offerings to gods of milk, 
ghee, soma and fat and it is stated that the gods being 
delighted and satisfied with these, bestow on the man who per- 
forms brahmayajfia affluence and security, life-breath, seed, his 
whole self and all auspicious blessings and streams of ghee and 
honey flow for his departed pitrs. The Sat. Br. XL 5. 6. 8 
enumerates other works that may be recited in brahmayajiia, 
the recital of which is like honey offerings to gods who being 
delighted and gratified bestow on the reciter the boons stated 
above, the works being AnuÂ£asanas ( Vedangas), vidyas (such 
as sarpa and devajana vidya mentioned in Chandogya VII. 1. 
1 ), vakovakya ( theological discourses called brahmodya, as in 
Vaj. S. 23. 9-12 and 45-62 ), Itihasapurana ( traditional history 
and legends ), Gathas, Narasamsls ( i. e. stanzas in praise of 
heroes ). 1<JTt The Tai. Ar. ( II. 10-13 ) has a more lengthy 
passage on brahmayajiia ; Tai. Ar. II. 10 is almost 16T9 the same 
as Sat. Br. except in two respects, viz. in the Tai. Ar. Athar- 
vangirasah. are said to be honey offerings and brahmana texts, 
itihasas, puranas, kalpas ( works on Srauta ritual ) and Gatha 
Narasamsls are said to be fat offerings and the rewards, bestowed 
by the gods when delighted by the brahmayajfia, are long life, 
brilliance, lustre, prosperity, glory, spiritual eminence and food. 
Tai. Ar. II. 11 describes how and where brahmayajfia is to be 
performed ' one who desires to offer brahmayajfia should repair 
to a place so far away to the east, north or north-east of his 
village that the thatch covering houses is not visible and when 
the sun rises he should wear his sacred thread ( in the upavlta 
form ) under his right arm, should sit down ( on a pure spot ), 
should wash both his hands with water, should sip water

once sprinkle his lips with water, and touch his head, eyes, 
nostrils, ears and heart ; he should spread out a large seat of 
darbhas, should be seated faoing the east with his legs crossed 
over each other ( the left foot being underneath and the right 
foot on the left thigh ) and then should repeat his Veda ; ( it is 
said that ) the darbhas are indeed the flavour ( or sweetness ) of 
waters and herbs ; he (by sitting on darbhas) makes his Veda full 
of sweetness. Placing his left hand on the right knee with the 
palm turned up and covering it with the right hand the palm of 
which is turned down and placing pavitras (blades of darbha) bet- 
ween both hands, he should begin with the syllable 'om' which is 
a yajus, which is the representative of the three Vedas, which is 
all speech, and is the highest syllable ; this has been declared 
by a rk ( Rg. 1. 164. 39 is quoted ). He recites the syllables 
bhtih, bhuvah, svah ; he thereby ( by repeating the vyahrtis ) 
employs the three Vedas. This is the truth ( quintessence ) of 
speech ; he thereby has employed the truth of speech. Then he 
recites thrice the Gayatrl verse, which is addressed to Savitr, by 
its feet separately, then by half of jit, then the whole verse 
without stopping. The sun is the creator of glory, he secures 
glory itself ; then he begins ( the next day ) the repetition of the 
Vedic texts from that point which he had noted ( the previous 
day )\ 1680 Tai. Ar. II. 12 states that if a man is unable to go 
out of the village he may perform brahmyajfia by revolving in 
his mind in the village itself the Veda by day or even by night; 
or if he cannot seat himself, then he may perform the brahma- 
yajfia even standing or lying down, since the principal matter 
is the reoitation of the Veda (time and place being quite 
subordinate ). Tai. Ar. II. 13 says that he should conclude the 
brahmayajiia by repeating thrice the verse 'Adoration to 
Brahma ( Veda or Prajapati ), to Agni, to the Earth, to herbs, to 
speech, to the Lord of speech ( Brhaspati ), I offer adoration to 



1680. The idea is that one is not to begin to recite Vedic texts at 
random. When a man has recited a portion of any Veda one day, he 
should note where he stopped and continue his recitation next day 
from that point. The Sp. Dh. S. I. 3. 11.19 also prescribes that one 
should go every day to the water-side before taking his morning meal 
and recite in a pure place a portion of the Veda in succession (i. e. one 
day he should begin where he stopped the previous day and so on ). 
Vide 3iv. gr. III. 4. 6 where the Tai. Â£r. allowing recitation of the 
Veda even while standing or lying down is quoted.

the great Visnu \ mi Then he should sip water and return 
home; thereafter whatever he gives becomes the fee of the 
sacrifice ( i. e. of brahmayajna ). 

The procedure of svadhyaya ( or brahmayajna ) in Asv. gr. 
III. 2. 2â III. 3. 4 is practically in the same words as in the Tai. 
Ar. quoted above. One or two points may be noted. The Asv. 
gr. 168B prescribes that one should recite gazing at the horizon or 
one may close one's eyes or one may look in suoh a way that 
one feels that one can concentrate one's mind. According to 
the Asv. gr. the shortest brahmayajna would be : om bhur bhu- 
vah svah ; the G&yatrl verse repeated thrice ; then at least one 
rk verse and then the verse ' namo brahmane ' ( quoted above ) 
repeated thrice. The Ahnikaprakasa p. 329 says that one who 
knows only a portion of the Veda should recite as brahmayajna 
the Purusasukta ( Rg. X. 90 ) and other hymns and one who 
knows only the Gayatrl should repeat ' ora ' as brahmayajna 
every day. 1682 Asv. gr. (III. 3.1) mentions the following 
works for svadhyaya, Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sameveda, Atharv&n- 
girasah, BrShmanas, Kalpas, Gathas Narasamsls, Itihasas, and 
Puranas, But it adds that one may recite only as much as one 
feels that one can afford to do with a concentrated mind. 

The San. gr. L 4 prescribes several hymns and verses of the 
"Rgveda for reciting in brahmayajna. Others following different 
Vedas and Sakhas differ as to the content of the brahmayajna. 
Vide Ahnika-prakasa pp. 328-336 for brahmayajna according to 
Katyayana and aocording to the followers of Saraaveda. Yaj. 
L 101 prescribes that as time and ability allow one may 
include in brahmayajna the Vedas together with the Atharva- 
veda, Itih&sa and philosophical texts. 

Brahmayajna is very rarely performed every day ( except 
by the most orthodox vaidikas and sastris ) in modern times and 
a fixed formula of brahmayajna has been decided upon, which 
is recited once a year in Sravana by most brahmanas in the 
Deccan. The formula for students of the ftgveda is as follows :

recites Rg. 1. 1. 1-9, then the first sentence of the Ait. Br. f the first 
sentences of the five sections of the Ait. Ar.; the first sentences of 
the Black and White Yajurveda, of the Samaveda, of the Atharva-

viz. &hv. 6rauta, Nirukta, Chandas, Nighantu, Jyotisa, Siksa, 
PSninfs grammar in order ; the first 'pada* of Yaj. I. 1 and of the 
MahSbhSrata (Ll.l), the first sufcra of the Nyaya, Purvamlmarhsa 
and Uttaramlmamsa; then a benedictory formula ('tacchamyor... 
catuspade ') and lastly the verse * namo brahmane ' is repeated 
thrice. 1884 After this brahmayajiia, tarpana of devas, sa Â°s and 
pitrs follows. 

The Dharmasindhu ( III. purvardba p. 299 ) says that 
brahmayajiia is to be performed once either after morning homa 
or after midday samdhya or after Vatevadeva, but those who 
study the Asval&yanasutra should perform it only after midday 
samdhya. After acamana and pranayama one should make the 
sarhkalpa ( Â£rlparameÂ§varaprltyartham brahmayajfiam karisye 
tadahgataya devarsyacarya-tarpanara karisye ) and if one's 
father is dead one should add in the sarhkalpa ( pitrtarpanam ca 
karisye ). It then sets out how it is to be performed by various 
people, such as those who have studied all vedas or one veda or 
only a portion or when one has no time. It says that the 
followers of the Taittirlya sakha repeat 'the words * vidyud-asi 
vidya me papmanam-rtat satyam-upaimi f at the commence- 
ment and the words * vrs^irasi vrsca me pftpmanam-rtat safcyam- 
upagam ' at the end. If a man is unable to repeat brahmayajiia 
sitting he may do it even when lying down. 

The Dharmasindhu notes that according to the followers of 
the Taittirlya sakha and of the Vajasaneya Samhita tarpana is 
not a part of brahmayajiia and so tarpana may be performed by 
them either before brahmayajfift or even spme time after 
brahmayajna.
