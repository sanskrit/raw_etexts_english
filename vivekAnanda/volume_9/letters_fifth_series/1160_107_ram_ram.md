## CVII

(*Translated from Bengali*)

*To Pandit Ram Ram Samjami*

DARJEELING  
\[*April*\] *1897*

DEAR RAM RAM,

I received your first letter in Calcutta. I was busy there, and so it
seems that I forgot to reply. You have deplored this in your letter, but
that is not right. I do not forget anyone — especially those who have
received grace from "Him".

While I was in England, I received your Avadhuta-Gitâ. It is beautifully
printed. You mentioned *Karma-Yoga* — I do not have that book with me.
It was printed in Madras. If there are any copies at the Math, I shall
ask them to send one to you.

I have been very sick, so right now I am staying at Darjeeling. As soon
as I feel better, I shall return to Calcutta. . . .

Please accept my special love. I pray for your welfare always.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA
