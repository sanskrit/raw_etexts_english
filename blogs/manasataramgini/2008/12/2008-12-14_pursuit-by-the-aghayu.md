title = "Pursuit by the aghAyu"

+++
Like the Xvarena departing from an ancient asura-worshipping king our
powers forsook us in the great struggle. Yet we kept fighting like
bhImasena against rAdheya on the fateful 15th day. In some ways it was
like the fight of veNkaTAdri and shrIranga against the turuShka-s after
the fall of vijayanagara or that of pratApa sImha after haldighATi. In
utter frustration we thought of the days of days of our youth when our
arrows rarely missed their targets. We deployed to formula of the
tANDya-s:  
“yo .adya saumyo vadho .aghAyUnAm udIrate viShUkuhasya dhanvanApa tAn
varuNo .apa dhamatu ||”  
Long ago the fierce sphigshiras, hrasvaroman, golamukha and others
rushed at us but we overthrew them in the battle of dvAdashAnta when our
ratha did not stop in midst of battle. The shUla of the bAdhamAna was
tormenting us despite a prolonged attack using the rakta-varNa shara-s
and several brahmAstra-s and even the kR^ityAstra. Mustering our
remaining strength we prepared for a fierce battle. We realized that we
had been bound by the kautsa abhichAra. We knew if we could once deploy
the spell of viliste\~NgA then we could come out of the ambush. But it
had one mystery that kept eluding us, for he who lacks it is seized by
nirR^iti. Who indeed escapes the spell of viliste\~NgA ?
