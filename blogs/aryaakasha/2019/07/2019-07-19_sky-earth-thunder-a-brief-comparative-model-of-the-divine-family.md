“Instead of posting a multi-thousand word article, I thought I’d try
experiment with a shorter-form word-count chart. This time, a) seeking
to briefly express how many Indo-European mythologies record a Sky
Father – Earth Mother, Striker/Thunderer familial unit; b) show that
Greek/Roman mythology did some … odd things, that lead to at least two
‘layers’ of the same mythic archetypal elements ‘repeating’ – as a way
of explaining why the Classical Zeus/Jupiter is \*also\* a
Striker/Thunderer, despite having the Sky Father theonymic etymology,
and fathering further Striker/Thunderer figures; c) also build in parts
of the observation of Zeus-Hades-Poseidon/Jupiter-\[Dis Pater,
Pluto\]-Neptune actually being a ‘triple-aspect’ of the same God.

There’s a lot of material that I could have added, both to the chart, as
well as to this annotative intro, to further demonstrate the fundamental
coterminity of the mythic characteristics going on here \[for example,
the great strength of Hercules, Antaeus, Hanuman, Thor, Bhima, etc.; and
the Serpent/Dragon-Slaying of Hercules, Zeus, Indra, Thor etc. … you get
the idea\] … but then we’d be just writing a multi-thousand word
article, wouldn’t we.”
