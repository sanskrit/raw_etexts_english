## ONE CIRCLE MORE[1](#fn1)

*\[A fragmentary poem composed at Ridgely Manor, in 1899\]*

One circle more the spiral path of life ascends  
And time's restless shuttle — running back and fro  
Through maze of warp and woof  
of shining  
threads of life — spins out a stronger piece. (Cf. a slightly different
version of the first three lines of this poem which appeared in Swami
Vivekananda's own handwriting on the left-hand side of the folded letter
paper containing the original draft (Vide the [facsimile](facsimile.htm)
):

       One circle more the spiral path of life ascends  
       And Time's restless shuttle running  
       back and fro  
       through maze of warp and woof spins out a  
       stronger piece.)

Hand in hand they stand — and try to  
fathom depths whence  
springs eternal love, each in other's eyes;  
And find  
No hold o'er that age but brings the youth anew —  
And time — the good, the pure, the true.
