of 5 sAmans that are expounded in the pa\~nchaviMsha brAhman 4.6. Not

vikarNa: araNyegeya gAnaM 6.1.7

with musical elongation); bhrAT

bhAsa: araNyegeya gAnaM 6.1.8  
It is composed on the lyric: RV 6.8.1. However, the lyric given in the
AraNya saMhitA 3.8 of the kauthuma/rANAyanIya sAmaveda slightly differs
(see brackets) suggesting that this might be derived from a different
R^ig tradition than shAkalya or re-worded for ritual deployment.  
pR^ikShasya (prakShasya) vR^iShNo aruShasya nU sahaH (mahaH) pra nu (no)

vaishvAnarAya matir navyasI shuchiH soma iva pavate chArur agnaye ||  
In this assembly of sages I will proclaim the greatness of the
red-spotted (the red destructive) bull jAtavedas. A pure and new mantra
flows to vaishvAnara, like the purified tasty soma for agni.

This song has two types of specialized magical stobhas. Type 1: hiM hiM
hiM; haM haM haM; bhaM (uttered with musical elongation).  
Type 2: idA; R^itaM me; bhadraM; shreyaH; vAmaM; varaM; suvaM; asti;
abhrAjIt; jyotiH; dIdivaH

mahAdivAkIrtya: araNyegeya gAnaM 6.1.9-18  
The mahAdivAkIrtya songs are largely stobha-gAnaM-s each having its
magic stobha-s  
The 1st song is called the head of the divAkIrtya and its magic stobhas
are:  
AyuH; jyotiH; vAg-jyotIH  
The 2nd song is called the neck and it has two type of magic stobhas.
Type 1: haM; sthi Type 2: hiyevA; hiyagni; hi-indrA; hi-pUShan;
hi-devAH.  
The 3rd is called the shoulders has the following magic stobhas:
vayomanaH; vayoprANAH; vayashchakShuH; vayaH shrotrAM; vayo ghoshaH;
vayo vrataM; vayo bhUtaM  
The 4th is called the sternum and has the same magical stobhas as the
3rd song but set to an entirely different tune.  
The 5th is called the right ribs and it has the stobhas: Urk; vAk;
dharma; adharma  
The 6th is called the left ribs and it has the two types of special
stobha-s. Type 1: haM vaM va. Type 2: dharma; vidharma; satyaM gAya;
R^itaM vada  
The 7th known as the Atman is composed on the lyric RV 10.170.1/Aranya
saMhitA 5.2 as the vikarNa sAman but is set to a totally different tune.
Its magical stobhas are the “special” vyAhR^itis (all musically
elongated): bhuvaH; janat; vR^idhat; karat  
Type 2: e abhrAjIt; jyotiH  
The use of the special vyAhR^iti-s is rather striking because outside of
the sAman tradition as in the divAkIrtya-s it is only used in the
atharvanic form of the shrauta ritual. Many of these calls are inaudibly
made by the brahman at the time of different soma pourings. The
atharvan-s also deploy them in their formula known as the praise of
indra in all great sacrifices:  
OM bhUr bhuvaH svar janad vR^idhat karad ruhan mahat tach Cham OM
indravanta stute ||  
The 8th mahAdivAkIrtya is known as the right thigh and has the special
stobha-s: bhUmiH; antarikShaM; dyauH; e bhutAya  
The 9th mahAdivAkIrtya is known as the left thigh and has the special
stobha-s: dyauH; antarikShaM; bhUmiH; e AyuShi  
The 10th song known as the tail is characterized by the special stobha:
jyotiH  
It exits in the nidhana: I(3) 12345
