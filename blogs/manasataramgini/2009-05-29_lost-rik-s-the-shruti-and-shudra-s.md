title = "Lost R^ik-s, the shruti andxa0shUdra-s"

A chaturtha asked me if mantra-s in the shruti were entirely
inaccessible to him. I told that if looked hard enough in the texts to
which he had adhikAra he could find enough to be moderately aware of the
contents of the shruti if not its praxis, which indeed is largely the
domain of the dvija-s. The vedic material embedded in the itihAsa-s, the
harivaMsha, and the purANa-s has been of some interest to me for a
while, though I have never gotten around to systematically studying it
by computational means. Kane and Apte have written on this topic, with
the former precisely touching on this issue of the adhikAra of the
shUdra and the shruti. A learned clansmen, a student of the first veda,
informed me that Apte is supposed to have had a student in the city of
my youth who did such a study quite systematically for the great epic
but I have never been able to access his dissertation on the same. There
are, of course, a few famous examples, which we have covered at length
on these pages before – the hymn of the ashvin-s and the praise of
indra. Some are intended quotations, while others like the spell of
queen kaushalyA are a mixture of vedic and later elements. The intended
quotations, as Apte points out, are labeled with the qualifiers such
as:  
imAm shrutiM udAharet  
nidarshanaM chAtra bhavati  
ityapi shrUyate shrutiH  
yastaM veda sa veda vit  
In the old days I used to have a debate with some acquaintances over the
possibility of a para-vedic tAntric system. It was in this context that
I observed that the itihAsa-s and the harivaMsha cite vaidika mantra-s
as such, but rarely, if ever, furnish a conventional tAntrika mantra
\[Footnote 1\]. This to me indicated that the conventional tAntrika
system post-dates the itihAsa-s though they do overlap with the majority
of the purANa-s as they survive today. Hence, I tend take the stance
that the tAntrika mantra shAstra is largely an evolute of the late
vaidika system rather than being a survivor of a para-vedic system
\[Footnote 2\].

Let us consider some well known citations from the bhArata. One chapter
that is replete with citations is the lecture of kR^iShNa to arjuna on
the nature of agnIShomau and nArAyaNa (vulgate MBH 12.343). It is
definitely a highly interpolated section with at least 3 major players:
1) brAhmaNa-s trying to assert their superiority in the brahma-kShatra
alliance. 2) vaiShNava-s trying to establish nArAyaNa-paratvaM and 3)
shaiva-s trying to establish rudra-paratvaM. Yet all manuscripts contain
the vedic citations in some form and the core of the narrative is
actually that of agni-Shoma which is directly based on the vedic
citations. This is evidenced by the original question of arjuna to
kR^iShNa:  
agnIShomau kathaM pUrvam ekayonI pravartitau |  
eSha me saMshayo jAtastaM chhindhi madhusUdana ||  
How did agni-Shomau, in days of yore, get established in the same
original source? Such a doubt has arisen, please clear it O madhusUdana.

It is in answering this that kR^iShNa explains the transformations of
nArAyaNa and cites some vaidika mantra-s as pramANa-s:  
nidarshanamapi hyatra bhavati:  
nAsIdaho na rAtrirAsIt | na sadAsIn nAsadAsIt  
tama eva purastAd abhavad vishvarUpaM ||

mantravAdo.apI hi bhavati:  
tvamagne yaj\~nAnAM hotA vishveShAM hito devebhir mAnuShe janeti ||

nidarshana.n chAtra bhavati:  
vishveShAm agne yaj\~nAnAM hoteti | hito devair mAnuShair jagata iti ||

\[1\] stotras to tAntrika deities might be found but they lack tAntrika
mantra-s; the harivaMsha might preserve proto-tAntric mantra elements in
the context of ekAnamshA as noted before.  
\[2\] in more general terms by extension I also believe that Talageri’s
idea of the vaidika system being restricted to the pUru-s as being
erroneous – the composition of the RV might have been dominated by the
pUru-s but this hardly means that the other Indo-Aryans and Iranians did
not follow a “vaidika” system.
