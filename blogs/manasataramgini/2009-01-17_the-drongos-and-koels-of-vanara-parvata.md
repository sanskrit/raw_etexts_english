In the long past I had made acquaintance with some extant dinosaurs on
the lower shelf of vAnara parvata. The avian mind is not exactly one
with which a mammal can intersect well. An acquaintance of mine who
studied bee-eaters felt he had a reasonable connection with them, but I
doubt I ever had anything even vaguely nearing such a connection with
any bee-eater. However, with a couple of drongos in the lower shelf of
vAnara parvata I had a peculiar interaction in my youth. Rising early in
those days, like the birds themselves, I used to daily ascend to the
peak of vAnara parvata in observing a vrata. It was on the shelf that I
came across a black drongo or the kAkarAjan. For the first few days it
made very aggressive noises. But as I would pass through the thick
overgrowth of drying grass and shrubbery it would join in to catch
insects. I did not realize right away, but apparently approaching it via
the grass resulted in a change in behavior of the drongo to a more
agonistic one. It also started making a weird new noise like the
huDDukAra of a pAshupata, which I eventually believed was a greeting to
me. Soon I saw his mate join in too and realized that they were nesting,
perhaps along with a few other birds, like a bee-eater and a babbler. A
moon or two later I saw one of the drongos’ chick had dropped out of the
nest. I first thought it was the doing of some pu\~njiShTha from the
vile dAsa settlement that lay yonder. But soon I noticed the koel
yonder, whose chick was the most likely doer. Other observations and
discussions with kalashajA, M and indrapureya confirmed that the drongo
was regularly parasitized by the koel and another cuckoo, the Indian
Cuckoo.

This was when I learned what seemed to a more general philosophical
issue. This black drongo, as well as its cousin the racket-tailed drongo
with which I made an acquaintance a little later, is an aggressive bird
that drives out all kinds of predators larger than itself and fearlessly
evades the hawks that might try to take it in the air. It is for this
reason that other birds make a living close to them the drongo and nest
in its company to avail of its defenses. Yet why is regularly overcome
by the parasitic koel or the Indian Cuckoo?  
There are many different sub-questions to this:  
1\) While usually highly successful in detecting and driving away other
nest predators, why does the drongo fail against the koel/cuckoo?  
2\) The drongo in my experience is one of the most intelligent birds and
has an ability to discriminate and recognize a wide range of patterns
visually and acoustically. Yet it does not seem to be very capable at
recognizing the koel eggs, though it might succeed once in a way?  
3\) The koel/cuckoo chicks are always bigger and distinct from the
drongo chicks yet the drongo rarely if ever manages to evict the
koel/cuckoo chick.

More than 17 years ago with these questions in mind I tried to learn
what the weak-links in the drongo’s defense were.
