## CXIII

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH,  
*8th November, 1901*.

MY DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)

By this this time you must have received the letter explaining the word
abatement. I did not write the letter nor send the wire. I was too ill
at the time to do either. I have been ever since my trip to East Bengal
almost bedridden. Now I am worse than ever with the additional
disadvantage of impaired eyesight. I would not write these things, but
some people require details, it seems.

Well, I am so glad that you are coming over with your Japanese friends —
they will have every attention in my power. I will most possibly be in
Madras. I have been thinking of leaving Calcutta next week and working
my way gradually to the South.

I do not know whether it will be possible to see the Orissan temples in
company with your Japanese friends. I do not know whether I shall be
allowed inside myself — owing to my eating "Mlechchha" food. Lord Curzon
was not allowed inside.

However, your friends are welcome to what I can do always. Miss Müller
is in Calcutta. Of course she has not visited us.

Yours with all love,

VIVEKANANDA.
