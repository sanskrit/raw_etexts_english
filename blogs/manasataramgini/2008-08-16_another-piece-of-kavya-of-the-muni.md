***Asthapada and Kesin, being an ode to Rati and Manmatha***

*There lived in a dusty corner Asthapada.*  
* Silent, unnoticed, and brooding, like a monk*  
*in his cave, did he bear out his days in the dusty, grey lair.*  
* Many passed that way everyday, rounding the corner,*  
*hurrying on towards the call of duty, their minds fully occupied.*  
* Thus it happened that none saw Asthapada, crouched in his web.*  
*And in a way this was all for the good, for if they saw him*  
* they would slay him with a broom, as is the wont of men.*

*Only one among many did see that which escapes men’s eyes.*  
* For he was a bard who saw, by putting mind and heart together,*  
*that which lies beyond the dull glare of shrouded objects.*  
* It is indeed destined by the gods that from the eyes of a few*  
*shoot forth radiant lances that pierce the surrounding patina,*  
* striking the weak spot in Virinci’s armour, as it were,*  
*and exposing the hidden wonders of his cavernous realms —*  
* not just by tors and tarns, sedges and swards, but even in the grey
dust.*

*And thus it was that he saw the hirsute Asthapada, in his grim, grey
corner.*  
* In no hurry was he, nor any oppressive thoughts clouded his mind.*  
*So, time was all his to talk and make merry with all creatures, big and
small.*  
* He was the friend of them all, the knower of their language and their
minds.*  
*He addressed Asthapada thus : “O Asthapada of fierce aspect, how is it
that thee livest*  
* in such a place, where Pusan’s rays scarce enter, and not to speak of
food.*  
*For, all the masterful insects prowl by the lights. What will you get
here?*  
* Besides, the delights of women this lair can’t give, for none pass by
this lonely spot.”*

*“Tell me Asthapada, are you a Sanyasin or what? Have you no need for
food and love?*  
* Come outside and look at the wide world — all buzzing with bees and
wasps,*  
*their sentries guarding the fortresses of madhu, the whirring flies,
droning dung beetles,*  
* Silent moths, mosquito hordes and dragonflies, the streaming lines of
soldier ants,*  
*as warrior band sets out to conquer, just as the Bharatas in search of
cattle,*  
* Teeming centipedes or fireflies, beneath crevice and under log or upon
tree and by street-lamp*  
*Every corner of the rich earth they occupy, where prey is plenty and
women abound.*  
* Take your own cousins, Asthapada, in the fur of dogs and horses they
make merry.”*

*“Beneath the damp rock lies the Deadly One, with sting held aloft,*  
* Verily like the club of Yama, waiting to slay curious adventurer.*  
*Asthapada, you have not seen the deadly mantis, concealed amid the
green blades.*  
* Although lost in prayer he seems, he is a knight of valor beyond
compare.*  
*Yet you live on in this remotest of lairs, Asthapada,*  
* and what chance have you of feasting and mating like them?*  
*Even the all pervading Matarishvan seems not to care for your dark,
lonely world. “*  
* Asthapada heard all this in silence, as if to say, “Wait and see, you
stripling”*

*The next day he passed that way again, and wonder of wonders :*  
* In Asthapada’s web lay entangled something, furiously struggling.*  
*But the swift Asthapada nailed him in trice with his powerful legs.*  
* Sucked dry, the carcass was hurled, a few hours later.*  
*And seeing the wonderous sight, he thought to himself,*  
* “How is it that some quarry should chance to wander*  
*into that realm which seemed so totally uninhabited, and of all
things,*  
* fall into Asthapada’s den? What propelled him there?”*  
* *  
*Many days passed on and the incident was forgotten.*  
* Ascetic Asthapada lived on, his monastic ways unwavering,*  
*Absolutely unconcerned about anything, just waiting and watching.*  
* One gloomy day when the clouds mounted the heavens and all*  
*was dark, and even the vibrant bard despondent he addressed his friend
thus :*  
* “Your life is a waste, Asthapada, as is mine. Here we will bear out
our days*  
*util Yama takes us. And we will leave behind nothing — not even our
memories. *  
* Sometimes fate plays tricks by placing people in such stations*

*It would seem that Rati and Manmatha in highest heaven heard these
words.*  
* For, Manmatha, of floral bow, glancing at his doe-eyed consort said
:*  
*“Let’s have fun, Rati. Surely, Asthapada deserves better luck.
Come.”*  
* So they mounted their chariots and set forth towards the dark
realm.*  
*But on the way they met Dharmaraja riding on his buffalo.*  
* “Salutations, O Kama. Wither are you going?,” says Yama.*  
*“To give meaning to Asthapada’s life.” said Manmatha and hurried on.*  
* “But his time is up, O Manmatha.” said Yama.*

*The next day the poet happened to pass by the desolate corner.*  
* And lo behold\! But what should he see in the lonely monastery of
strands?*  
*Asthapada was not alone. But now there were two more like him.*  
* There was the beautiful Kesin, prancing about the silver strands,*  
*with her hairy legs, like an impatient charger prancing about before a
charge.*  
* Besides her, was her other suitor, Sahasraksha, with his many eyes
jutting out from his forehead.*  
*The sight filled him with both joy and surprise.*  
* “How on earth did they get there? How did they seek him out here? ” he
wondered*

*But there was no time for wonder, for soon a most fierce duel broke
out.*  
* Asthapada was the larger, and the fiercer is true,*  
*But Sahasraksha was not to be left far behind, for he was deft and
virulent.*  
* Asthapada lunged forward and tried to hold Sahasraksha in his grip.*  
*But he nimbly veered away, and struck out at Asthapada.*  
* Kesin watched on breathlessly : the stronger, better one would win the
day and her hand.*  
*Asthapada reeled and retreated to a farther corner.*

*The whole silvery web seemed to throb as the mighty contestants
clashed,*  
* Just as Suyodhana and the son of Kunti, with their maces, in the days
of yore.*  
*Asthapada presently made another rush and speared Sahasraksha.*  
* Even as Sahasraksha was thus impaled, Asthapada came down heavily upon
him.*  
*A decisive blow it was– Sahasraksha’s limb was severed and it fell,
throbbing in the mesh.*  
* Still the valiant, inexorable Sahasraksha fought on, hobbling on seven
now.*  
*Finally, Asthapada held him firmly in his iron grasp and shook him
vigorously,*  
* like Anjaneya shredding a tree. Sahasraksha fell lifeless.*

*His deflated corpse, sucked dry of all vitality was hurled away in
disdain.*  
* His maiden having thus been won, the bard left the spot,*  
*expecting him to celebrate his victory by throbbing in nuptial frenzy
with Kesin,*  
* inevitably struck by Manmatha’s dart, deluded utterly by her
charms,*  
*and falling head over heels in his own web\!*  
* A fairy tale ending : a great duel, victory, a wife, and then living
happily ever after.*  
*But Yama was right afterall : an utter shock was to greet the poet’s
eyes.*  
* The next day, came the bard as usual, his old friend to meet.*  
* *  
*But what should he see at the now familiar resort? All empty and
desolate\!*  
* Both Sahasraksha and Asthapada lay dead in the web —*  
*a great resemblance in their grey lifelessness,*  
* only, Sahasraksha’s corpse more decayed than Asthapada’s.*  
*The bloated Kesin had slain Asthapada, her sole work having been
done.*  
* She deposited a large sack and left. Such are the ways of the
impregnators.*  
*By sheer chance did Kesin come across Asthapada.*  
* Impelled by Kama did Asthapada finally defy even Yama: a hundred
Asthapadas in that sack\!*
