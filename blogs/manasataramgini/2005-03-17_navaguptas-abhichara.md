title = "navagupta’s abhichAra"

+++
sha\~Nkara bhagavatpAda had defeated the famous tantric navagupta of the
pITha of kAmarUpa in a debate. navagupta unable to come to terms with
his defeat invoked chAmuNDA with oblations of twigs dipped in menstrual
blood and the sUtaka fluid. And thus he laid a spell on sha\~Nkara. The
unerring abhichAra of the great goddess had its effect on the Acharya
and he was afflicted by a terrible sore in his ass. As a result of this
he was wasting away much to the dismay of his students. When pressed by
them he revealed that it was a result of navagupta’s incantations. His
student padmapAda quickly got into action and invoked the most deadly
spell of nR^isiMha in the form known as the aShTamukha gaNDabheruNDa
ugranR^isiMha. As result the spell of navagupta was back-hurled and it
possessed him and killed him. The accounts state that the AchArya had to
worship kumAra at kumAra parvata to rid himself of the disease. It here
that he composed the famous poem to the god in the bhuja\~Nga meter.
