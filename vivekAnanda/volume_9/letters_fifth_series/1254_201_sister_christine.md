## CCI

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*6th August 1901*.

Letters are sometimes, dear Christina, like mercy — good to the one that
sends and the other that receives.

I am so happy that you are calm and resigned as ever. You are ever that.
"Mother knows", indeed; only I know that "Mother" not only knows, but
does — and is going to do something very fine for me in the near future.
What do you think will be very good for me on earth? Silver? Gold? Pooh!
I have got something infinitely better; but a little gold will not be
amiss to keep my jewel in proper surroundings, and it is coming, don't
you think so?

I am a man who frets much, but waits all the same; and the apple comes
to my mouth by itself. So, it is coming, coming, coming.

Now, how are you? Growing ever thinner, thinner, thinner, eh? Do have a
very good appetite and good sleep in anticipation of the coming good
time — to be in trim for welcoming its advent.

How did the heat feel this year? We read all sorts of horrible stories
about American heat waves. You have beaten the world's records, even in
heat — that's Yankee push, surely.

Well, you are right as about taste: I renounce the yellow of gold and
the white of silver, but stick to amber always — that is to my taste.

Amber and corals I always hated; but of late I am awakening to their
beauty. One learns as he lives, is it not?

I am going to Darjeeling tomorrow for a few days and will write to you
from there. Now *gute Nacht* \[good night\] and *au revoir* \[good-bye\]
for the present.

Ever yours truly,  
VIVEKANANDA.
