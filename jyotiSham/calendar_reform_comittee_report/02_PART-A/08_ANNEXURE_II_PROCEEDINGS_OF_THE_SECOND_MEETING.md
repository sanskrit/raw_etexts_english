The second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 8th March, 1954 at 10 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi. 



The following members were present :-- 



1. Prof. M. N. Saba, Chairman 2. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Member 3. Shri J. S. Karandikar, 4. Prof. R. V. Vaidya, 



5. Shri N. C. Lahiri, 1. Prof. A. C. Banerji could not attend due to his other engagement which was appointed earlier. Dr. Daftari could not attend due to illness. 



2. Dr. Daftari sent a letter which was read by the Chairman. According to his 'suggestion it was decided that Yoga should be given in the Experimental Calendar, but Karana need not be given. Instead of 27 Yogas only Vyatipāta and Vaidhrti calculated with tropical longitudes of the Sun and the Moon should be given. 



3. The following further resolutions were adopted after discussion : 



(1) All festival days and days of religious obser vances in India should be shown and mention should be made of States in which they are observed, as has been done in the calendar. 



(2) The system of starting the year on the day following Vernal Equinox is confirmed. 



(3) Caitra should be the first month and the names of the months should be Caitra, Vaisakha, etc. Alternatively the civil months may be called Meṣa, Vrsabha etc., Meṣa being the name for solar Caitra. 



(4) The lengths of the months would be fixed as follows : 



Caitra 30 days (31 days in leap years), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiṣtha-31, Aṣādha-31, Srāvana-31, Bhādra-31, Aśvina-30, Kārtika-30, Agrahāyaṇa-30, Pauṣa-30, 



Māgha-30, and Phalguna-30 days. Leap-years should correspond with the leap-years of the Gregorian calendar. 



(5) Mahāviṣuva saṁkrānti is to be stated in the calendar on the vernal equinox day and the . Uttarayana saṁkrānti on the winter solstice day. Makara saṁkrānti should be on the day when the sidereal Makara is passed (ie, on 14th Jan. as at present). Vaiśākhi is to be celebrated on the first of 



Vaisakha. 



(6) Dates of heliacal rising and setting of Jupiter and Venus should be given in the calendar. 



(7) Sukla and Krṣna Pakṣas should be separately shown and tithis should be numbered from s 1 to 15 and K 1 to 14 and K 30. 



(8) Moment of rising of the centre of the apparent Sun to be given after making correction for refraction. The moment of sunset similarly calculated should also be given. 



(9) The moment of Sun's entry into the naksatra divisions should also be stated in the calendar. 



4. Dr. Gorakh Prasad enquired as to the amount of the precession of the equinoxes adopted in calcula ting the nakṣatras. He was informed that the calculations have been made with a constant ayanāṁśa of 23° 15', as no definite directive was given in the

Reform Committee to complete the outstanding work, for which the C.S.I.R. may be moved by the Chairman. 



12. The suggestions received from different persons and institutions were read and discussed. 



previous meeting for changing the ayanāṁśa year after year. He remarked that this is unscientific and opposed to the actual happenings in the sky. 



5. At this time the meeting was postponed for lunch till 3-0 PM when all the members present again met. 



6. Dr. Gorakh Prasad stressed upon the necessity of calculating the nakṣatras ( and also the sidereal Meṣādi etc. ) in such a manner that at the time of a particular nakṣatra, say Krttikā, the moon may be seen near the Krttikā group of stars in the sky. This practice is being followed since the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific and we cannot change this old systein. Shri Karandikar did not support this and stressed upon the necessity of adopting a constant ayanamśa. The Chairman remarked that constant ayanāṁśa was opposed to science. Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya pointed out that if any change is intro duced in the ayanāṁśa at this stage, the calendar for four years so far calculated will require a thorough revision involving a great amount of labour and time. It was, however, agreed that if the difference be small such as one or two minutes of arc, the labour involved in the revision would not be much, 



7. Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that the Nakṣatras and the sidereal Meṣādi should be calculated from a fixed point which was 23° 15' in advance of the vernal equinoctial point on a certain date ( the middle of the period of 5 years for which the Pancanga was to be calculated %.e. on 21st March, 1956 ) and the rate at which this ayanāṁśa is increasing on account of precession of the equinoxes should be taken into account. 



8. For the purpose of examining the above position thoroughly, the Chairman asked Prof. Vaidya to prepare a note on the Zero-point of the Hindu celestial globe according to the Surya Siddhānta and other older Indian Siddhāntas. This will be circulated and after taking opinion the point in paragraph 7 above will be decided by the Chairman. Pending finalization of this question, the calculations so far made should be regarded as provisional. 



9. The introduction to the report of the Calendar Reform Committee prepared by the Chairman was discussed and the general outline of the report approved. 



10. The activities of the C.S.I.R. on the recommen dation of the Calendar Reform Committee for publishing an Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac on behalf of the Government of India was explained to the members by the Chairman. 



11. It was resolved that an extension for six months should be given to the office of the Calendar 



Memorandum issued by the Chairman to the members 



of the Calendar Reform Committee 



on 22nd June, 1954. In the second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee held at the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi on the 8th March, 1954, Dr. Gorakh Prasad raised the question of adopting variable ayanāmśā for the purpose of calculating nakṣatras as well as sidereal Meṣadi. After discussion it was, however, decided that Prof. Vaidya would prepare a note on the subject which would be circulated amongst the members, and after obtaining their opinion, the Chairman would decide the question. 



Dr. Gorakh Prasad thereafter submitted a note containing his definite proposals in this respect, which was also circulated amongst the members. He proposed that“ 23° 15' be taken as the ayanāṁśa on the vernal equinox day (21st March ) of 1956, because this will reconcile most of the Pancāngas in India based on modern constants." 



Prof. Vaidya prepared his note and it was circulated. Another note prepared in this office on the same subject was also circulated. It was explained in these notes that the Meṣādi of Surya Siddhānta was actually the V.E. point, and as the seasons and different solar and lunar months of the year are connected with Meṣādi, the year of the Indian religious calendar cannot but be the seasonal or tropical year. It has also been shown that it is not possible to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the actual amount of ayanansa at any epoch, from an examination of the star positions given by the Surya Siddhanta. 



Replies to the circular letters have been received from Dr. Daftari and Shri Karandikar, who desire that we should stick to the proposals adopted in the first meeting, viz., should adopt a constant ayanāṁśa of 23° 15' for our religious calendar. I have consulted Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya also on this question. 



It appears to me that if we accept Dr. Gorakh Prasad's proposal of adopting a variable ayanāṁśa for the calculation of nakṣatra as well as Mesadi, we shall lose the seasonal nature of the months which is against the Dharmaśāstra, as our Meṣādi being the V.E. point cannot be calculated with a variable ayanāṁśa. We cannot therefore accept Dr. Gorakh

Prasad's second part of the proposal that the sidereal Meṣadi should also be calculated with variable ayanāṁśa. It should therefore be calculated with a fixed ayanāmba of 23° 15' as already decided. 



As regards the calculation of nakṣatras, I agree that it should be done with a variable ayanāṁśa, otherwise the nakṣatra divisions will lose all connec tions with the stars or star-groups contained in those nakṣatras. For this purpose I agree with Dr. Gorakh Prasad that the ayanāṁśa of 23° 15' should relate to 21st March, 1956, the middle of the five-yearly period. 



This is acceptable without entering into any controversy about any particular value of ayanāṁśa. 



The result would be that the Meṣādi would not coincide with any particular nakṣatra division for all time. This has got support of our śāstras behind it, as there is mention of such receding back of the V.E. point ( our Meṣādi ) over the nakṣatra divisions. 



The five yearly experimental calendar already prepared will be revised where necessary in the light of the above docision.
