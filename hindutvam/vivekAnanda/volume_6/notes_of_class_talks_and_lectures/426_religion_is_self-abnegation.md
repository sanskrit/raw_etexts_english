## RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION

One cannot divide the rights of the universe. To talk of "right" implies
limitation. It is not "right" but "responsibility". Each is responsible
for the evil anywhere in the world. No one can separate himself from his
brother. All that unites with the universal is virtue; all that
separates is sin. You are a part of the Infinite. This is your nature.
Hence you are your brother's keeper.

The first end of life is knowledge; the second end of life is happiness.
Knowledge and happiness lead to freedom. But not one can attain liberty
until every being (ant or dog) has liberty. Not one can be happy until
all are happy. When you hurt anyone you hurt yourself, for you and your
brother are one. He is indeed a Yogi who sees himself in the whole
universe and the whole universe in himself. Self-sacrifice, not
self-assertion, is the law of the highest universe. The world is so evil
because Jesus' teaching, "Resist not evil", has never been tried.
Selflessness alone will solve the problem. Religion comes with intense
self-sacrifice. Desire nothing for yourself. Do all for others. This is
to live and move and have your being in God.
