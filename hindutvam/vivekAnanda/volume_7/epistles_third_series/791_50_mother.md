1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*7th April, 1900*.

DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),

Accept my congratulations for the news of the cause of the wound being
completely removed. I have no doubt of your being perfectly cured this
time.

Your very kind note cheered me a good deal. I do not mind at all whether
people come round to help me or not; I am becoming calm and less
worried.

Kindly convey my best love to Mrs. Melton. I am sure to recover in the
long run. My health has been improving in the main, though there are
occasional relapses. Each relapse becoming less, both in tone and in
time.

It is just like you to have Turiyananda and Siri treated. The Lord has
blessed you for your great heart. May all blessings ever follow you and
yours.

It is perfectly true that I should go to France and work on French. I
hope to reach France in July or earlier. Mother knows. May all good ever
follow you, is the constant prayer of 

Your son,

VIVEKANANDA.
