## REASON, FAITH AND LOVE

\[Swamiji had made the home of the Hale family his headquarters during
almost all of 1894 before the pivot of his activities moved eastward to
the Atlantic Coast. It was on George W. Hale's letter paper and thus,
presumably, during one of his stays in the latter's home, that Swamiji
jotted down in pencil a series of notes on the subjects of reason,
faith, and love, which have recently come to light. Unfortunately the
date of the manuscript cannot be accurately determined.\]

Reason — has its limits — its base —  
its degeneration. The walls round it —  
Agnosticism. Atheism. But must not stop  
The beyond is acting upon influencing us every  
moment — the sky the stars acting upon us — even  
those not seen. Therefore must go beyond — reason  
alone can't go — finite cannot get at the infinite

Faith its degeneration when alone — bigotry  
fanaticism — sectarianism. Narrowing  
finite therefore cannot get to the infinite  
Sometimes gain in intensity but loses in  
extensity — and in bigots & fanatics become  
worship of his own pride & vanity

Is there no other way — there is Love  
it never degenerates — peaceful softening  
ever widening — the universe is too small  
for its expansiveness.

We cannot define it we can only trace  
it through its development and describe its surroundings

It is at first — what the gravitation  
is to the external world — a tendency to unification  
forms and conventionalities are its death.  
Worship through forms — methods — services  
forms — up to then no love.

When love comes method dies.  
Human language and human forms God as father, God as mother, God as  
the lover — Surata-vardhanam etc. Solomon's Song of  
Songs — Dependence and independence  
Love Love —

Love the chaste wife — Anasuya Sita —  
not as hard dry duty but as ever pleasing  
love — Sita worship —

The madness of Love — God intoxicated man  
The allegory of Radha — misunderstood  
The restriction more increase —  
Lust is the death of love  
Self is the death of love  
individual to general  
Concrete to abstract — to absolute  
The praying Mohammedan and the girl  
The Sympathy — Kabir —  
The Christian nun from whose hands blood came  
The Mohammedan Saint  
Every particle seeking its own complement  
When it finds that it is at rest  
Every man seeking — happiness — & stability  
The search is real but the objects are themselves  
but happiness is coming to them momentary at least  
through the search of these objects.

The only object unchangeable and the only complement of character and
aspirations of the human Soul is God.

Love is struggle of a human Soul to find its complement its stable
equilibrium its infinite rest.
