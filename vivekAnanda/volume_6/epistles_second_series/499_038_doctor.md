## XXXVIII

KHETRI,  
*27th April, 1893*.

DEAR DOCTOR, (Dr. Nanjunda Rao, M.D.)

Your letter has just reached me. I am very much gratified by your love
for my unworthy self. So, so sorry to learn that poor Bâlâji has lost
his son. "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord." We only know that nothing is lost or can be lost. For
us is only submission, calm and perfect. The soldier has no right to
complain, nay murmur, if the general orders him into the cannon's mouth.
May He comfort Balaji in his grief, and may it draw him closer and
closer to the breast of the All-merciful Mother!

As to my taking ship from Madras, I do not think it feasible, as I have
already made arrangements from Bombay. Tell Bhattacharya that the Raja
(The Maharaja of Khetri, Rajputana.) or my Gurubhâis would be the last
men to put any obstacles in my way. As for the Rajaji, his love for me
is simply without limit.

May the Giver of all good bless you all here and hereafter, will be the
constant prayer of

SACHCHIDANANDA.  
(Swamiji uses to call himself such in those days.)
