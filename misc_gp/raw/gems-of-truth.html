<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Introduction</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The present age is marked by the growth of rank materialism, which is subversive of true happiness. People have begun to regard God and religion as superfluous and openly indulge in all sorts of blasphemy. The doctrines of rebirth and life after death are being held as figments of the brain. Talks of Self-realization, cultivation of other-worldliness and practice of devotion, etc., are declared as useless and nothing but impediments to the progress of the nation or community. Material advancement is recognized as the summum bonum of human existence. Gratification of the senses is looked upon as the highest form of bliss. Practically the whole field of literature is being flooded with books intended to advance the material interests of humanity, novels and romantic stories and erotic poems couched in flowery language and tending to promote a vulgar taste. In such an age books of an ontological nature dealing with devotion, dispassion and disinterested action are little calculated to satisfy the general public. Nevertheless, my experience of the past fifteen years leads me to believe that even this furious storm of unbelief raging all-round in the world has not been able to shake the solid foundations of the grand edifice of spirituality raised on this sacred land of Bhāratavarṣa by the sages and seers of old, and it is very unlikely that they would ever be shaken. In the spiritual environment of India genuine seekers of truth and aspirants of a devout temperament are still to be found, even though their number has dwindled. Under such circumstances it would not be unreasonable  to hope that this philosophical treatise written in a lucid and homely style will be read with wide interest and people will derive special benefit from it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The writer of this small volume has a very high place in my estimation. such exalted souls are rarely to be found in the spiritual world. The divine sage <span xml:lang="en-US">Nārada</span> says in his ‘Aphorisms on Bhakti’:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">महत्सङ्गस्तु दुर्लभोऽगम्योऽमोघश्च।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Exalted souls are not so easy to find; they cannot be recognized as such, even if found; and once found, they are sure to benefit those who come in contact with them.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To my mind, the author of this treatise is one such exalted soul as have been little understood or recognized by the world. And there is little wonder that such a person should not be recognized. A simple and unsophisticated soul, who from his general talk may be easily taken to be uneducated and uncultured, and who lives like an ordinary householder carrying on business transactions, can be hardly recognized as a spiritually advanced soul. It may, however, be submitted in this connection that whatever has been stated above represents my own personal estimate of the writer. It is not my intention to force this view on the mind of the readers, nor does the author himself seek to do so. Nay, whatever I have written about him here, was not only written without his permission but was not even shown to him before it was sent to the press. Had I sought his permission in this behalf, I am sure he would never have granted it.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">The Greatness of God</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">God is not a mere imagination (<span class="char-style-override-7">कल्पना</span>)<br/>but an indubitable Reality</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are some people who hold God to be a mere imagination; but a careful thought would betray their ignorance in respect of the true nature of God. God is not something imaginary like a castle in the air. That which is imaginary <span class="char-style-override-7">(कल्पित)</span> is false <span class="char-style-override-7">(असत्य)</span> and that which is false cannot stand the test of reason. It is liable to appear and disappear; though visible, it cannot abide in one particular form and is constantly undergoing transformation. On the other hand, that which is real <span class="char-style-override-7">(सत्)</span> is not liable to appear and disappear. It is always beginningless, abides in one form and is not subject to change.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If that which is real appears otherwise to anyone, it is due to an error on his part. This, however, does not detract a jot from the reality of that substance. For instance, if the moon appears yellow to some one through a defective vision, this does not make the moon yellow, because the moon is always pure white and free from yellowish tinge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That which is existent <span class="char-style-override-7">(सत्)</span> is never otherwise <span class="char-style-override-7">(असत्)</span>. That alone is real which never ceases to exist. In the Bhagavadgītā Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa defines <span class="char-style-override-7">(सत्)</span> as follows:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभि:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>“The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be; the reality of both has thus been perceived by the seers of truth.”</span><span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The only real substance is God, who is knowledge and bliss combined and is called by several names such as Paramātmā, Parameśwara, Brahma, Puruṣottama, Allāha, Khudā and so on. He does not change even though everything else may change. That, in which all changing substances exhaust themselves, that, which is characterized as an eternal and indubitable truth and which is the witness of everything is recognised as God. That which is not negatived even though repudiated by reason, and which is concluded by the wise to be real, is God. He is also called the Intelligent Power or the Intelligent Principle.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The universe consists of two substances, the spiritual or intelligent <span class="char-style-override-7">(चेतन)</span> and the material or non-intelligent <span class="char-style-override-7">(जड)</span>. They are also known by the names of Puruṣa (Spirit) and Prakr̥ti (Matter). The spirit has been further divided into two sub-heads, viz., the individual soul <span class="char-style-override-7">(जीवात्मा)</span> and the Universal Soul or Oversoul <span class="char-style-override-7">(परमात्मा)</span>, the former being a part and parcel <span class="char-style-override-7">(अंश)</span>  of the latter. Whereas the individual souls are numerous, the Universal Soul is one. This universe, consisting of twenty-four fundamental principles or categories, has evolved out of matter.</p>
<p class="Shlok">महाभूतान्यहङ्कारो बुद्धिरव्यक्तमेव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचरा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XIII. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The five subtle elements (ether, air, fire, water and earth), the ego, the intellect, the unmanifest, the ten organs, of perception and action the mind and the five objects of sense (sound, touch, colour, taste and smell).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That which is material lends itself to our perception <span class="char-style-override-7">(दृश्य)</span>. That, on the other hand, which is intelligent is the Perceiver <span class="char-style-override-7">(द्रष्टा)</span>. They are also known as the knowable <span class="char-style-override-7">(ज्ञेय)</span> and the knower <span class="char-style-override-7">(ज्ञाता)</span> respectively. The knowable is dependent on the knower. The Lord has said:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अथवा बहुनैतेन किं ज्ञातेन तवार्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विष्टभ्याहमिदं कृत्स्नमेकांशेन स्थितो जगत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā X. 42)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Or, what will you gain by knowing all this in detail, Arjuna? Suffice it to say that I hold this entire universe by a fraction of My Yogic power.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That which is material (<span class="char-style-override-7">जड़</span>) is finite, while the Spirit is infinite. Matter is liable to appear and disappear, while the Spirit is unborn <span class="char-style-override-7">(अज)</span>, eternal<span class="char-style-override-7"> (नित्य)</span> and imperishable <span class="char-style-override-7">(अविनाशी)</span>. Matter is always in a state of flux. That is why it is also called ephemeral <span class="char-style-override-7">(क्षणभंगुर)</span>. The Spirit never undergoes any change. The changes in Matter are mistaken by the ignorant as occurring in the Spirit, due to its contact with Matter. But on careful investigation the changes appearing in the Spirit are not substantiated just as the existence of threadlike streaks of light like the plumes of a Peacock, appearing in the sky due to a defective eyesight, is not confirmed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The fact that God is an indubitable reality and not a mere concept is borne out by all scriptural texts. The anecdotes relating to Dhruva, Prahlāda and other such devotees establish it beyond doubt. Events like the appearance of the Lord in the form of a Manlion <span class="char-style-override-7">(नृसिंह)</span>, His killing Hiraṇyakaśipu, rescuing and instructing Prahlāda and revealing Himself in the woods before Dhruva and the fruition of the benediction conferred upon him in the shape of his installation on the paternal throne and his becoming well-versed in the scriptures without receiving regular instruction, merely as a result of the touch of the Lord’s Conch, cannot be reconciled with the theory of treating God as a mere concept.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similar stories are narrated at several places in the Vedas, the Smr̥tis, the old Chronicles (the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata) and the Purāṇas alike. They are all authentic stories, historical facts and not mere figments of fiction. It is the height of folly to regard them as fibs of the type found in novels. It could not have been possible for stories, not representing facts, to enjoy such popularity and to filter through the sieve of remote antiquity down to the present day in the form of authentic history.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even in the recent past, have flourished a number of devotees and saints in the person of Sµuradāsa, Tulasīdāsa, Tukārāma, Narasī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Mīrā Bāī. The existence of God as well as many incidents connected with His appearance in a tangible form, are proved by the writings of the aforesaid holy persons. To disbelieve in the life-history and sayings of these personages, is to betray one’s folly. Our faith in God is gradually strengthened as we ponder over the incidents in the lives of these saints. To discredit such selfless and truthful persons and to allege that they gave currency to these stories with a view to deceive the world, amounts to vilifying them. In the eyes of those who stigmatise such persons, there is no one worthy of credence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides the testimony of these persons, there are several other convincing arguments in favour of God’s existence. Careful thought would reveal the fact that even birds and beasts, to say nothing of human beings, proclaim the existence of God. When a man proceeds to belabour a dog with a cudgel, the dog yelps from a distance as soon as it sees the cudgel. Even before it receives a blow or sustains an injury, the sense of impending danger sets it crying. It gives the alarm in the hope of averting the coming danger. It feels sanguine that some protecting hand would surely come to its rescue on hearing the alarm. We often see that the dog is saved thereby.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That Benevolent Power whose protection against all danger sentient and insentient beings invoke through piteouswails, and which relieves their affliction is recognized by us as God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even those who do not believe in God, when in serious trouble, make piteous appeals to some invisible power for relieving their distress. The power with whose help they seek to remedy the evil, to whom they bow in all humility and reverence and who readily responds to their piteous calls—that intelligent, merciful power, the refuge of the helpless, surely deserves their gratitude and recognition as God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even to the present day the efforts of those who repose faith in God and take refuge in Him have been, and are, crowned with success. It is not possible for something, which is non-existent to be proclaimed as existent. Even if it is proclaimed as such, the belief cannot hold the field for any length of time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Every phenomenal existence has surely got some great power behind it. One can reasonably admit change in phenomenal existence, but not its negation <span class="char-style-override-7">(अभाव)</span>. For that which is non-existent cannot be brought into being. That which sustains the whole universe, nay, which may be called its ultimate cause, should be recognized as God. For every effect has a cause behind it. No effect is observed without a cause: nothing can subsist without a support. Hence that which is the support <span class="char-style-override-7">(आधार)</span> and ultimate cause<span class="char-style-override-7"> (मूलकारण)</span> of the whole universe is God. He is intelligent (subjective), for that which is material (objective) has not the capacity to distinguish a thing and to operate it according to certain fixed laws and to keep it under control. God is not only proved by reasoning <span class="char-style-override-7">(युक्ति)</span> and scriptural testimony <span class="char-style-override-7">(शास्त्रप्रमाण)</span>, but is also visible <span class="char-style-override-7">(प्रत्यक्ष).</span> For those who have endeavoured to see Him have had, and still have His vision. Even now anyone who may like to see Him can do so by following certain precepts. By following the methods of those who have had His vision one can see Him. Of course, it is essential to put in the amount of effort that is necessary for attaining such a priceless object. Ordinary endeavour is required for attaining an object of ordinary worth, while extraordinary effort is necessary for attaining an extraordinary object. Should anyone like to see His Majesty the King of England, he can do so by making effort in that direction after going to England. Even if he is not able to do so for some reason or another, he should at least be able to know that the King is in England, for such is the report of those who have had an interview with him and the administration is also observed as being duly carried on under his commands. Similarly, if anyone likes to interview the Supreme Lord of countless universes he can do so by putting in efforts commensurate with His greatness. It is not always possible to have an interview with a king whenever one likes. One may or may not have it, for earthly monarchs are generally selfish and are not inclined to grant interviews unless their interests are served thereby. But the Almighty, who is friendly and kindly disposed to all by nature, has made it a rule to grant interviews to those who may like to see Him. He has said in the Bhagavadgītā IV. 11:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, howsoever men approach Me, even so do  I seek them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a man gives up his efforts without having an interview with a king, the efforts, made up till now, go in vain; but the least endeavour that one makes to obtain a vision of God does not go in vain <span class="char-style-override-7">(नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति)</span>. ‘The efforts that are directed towards realizing God are not lost’. A vision of God is also different from an interview with a monarch <span class="char-style-override-7">(आश्चर्यवत् पश्यति कश्चिदेनम्)</span>. That which is intuitively perceived is quite distinct from that which is cognized through the senses conjoined with the mind and intellect. For the outer senses <span class="char-style-override-7">(बाह्येन्द्रिय),</span> nay, even the inner senses <span class="char-style-override-7">(अन्त:करण)</span>, finite as they are, cannot determine the reality of an object, just as an aeroplane or a bird flying very high in the sky cannot be perceived with the naked eye; or the collyrium applied to one’s eyes, cannot be seen even though it is in close proximity to the eye; or the stars, even though always present in the sky, cannot be observed during the daytime, overshadowed as they are by the dazzling rays of the sun, and the sun is not seen at night, screened as it is from our view by the earth. Just as it is sheer folly to deny the existence of all these merely because they are not visible to the naked eye, it is equally preposterous to deny the existence of God merely because He is not visible to us who are deficient in intellect and lack in faith and devotion. Though the sun’s rays are always laden with moisture, its particles are not seen by us, minute as they are. Again, we cannot perceive certain objects on account of some defect in our sense-organs. For instance, one who is deaf cannot hear a sound <span class="char-style-override-7">(शब्द)</span> and one who has lost his vision cannot cognize colour <span class="char-style-override-7">(रूप)</span>. Our senses are unable to distinguish even homogeneous substances that are promiscuously mixed together. One cannot distinguish and separate a goat’s milk from that of a cow after the two have been mixed together. Similarly there are other substances which defy our senses. For instance, all of us are endowed with mind and intellect; but their existence is not perceptible by our senses. Even the knowledge derived through our mind and intellect is limited and open to correction. We recognize a particular person, with the help of our mind and intellect, to be virtuous <span class="char-style-override-7">(धर्मात्मा)</span>. Shortly afterwards we revise our opinion about him and begin to look down upon him as a sinner. Suppose a priest is giving us a religious discourse and a large audience is present to listen to his sermon. Everyone of those listening to him, forms a different opinion about him. After the discourse is over, the listeners begin to exchange their views about the priest. One of them brands him as a hypocrite <span class="char-style-override-7">(दम्भी),</span> because according to him the priest simply sermonizes and does not practise the virtues which he preaches. Another does not share the view of the first, but simply calls the priest a selfish man because the latter gladly accepts presents offered to him. A third one contradicts the second and says that the priest does not sermonize with the object of receiving presents, although he concedes that the priest covets honour and homage. There is a fourth who disagrees with all the three of his friends and thinks that the priest has to accept presents as well as honour simply to please his disciples while, as a matter of fact, he sermonizes because he thinks that a discourse on God, even though meant for the audience, will also have the effect of purifying his own soul. His opinion is therefore clearly this that the learned priest sermonizes for the good of himself as well as of others. Another man who is a very pious soul is of the opinion that the priest is the very embodiment of benediction<span class="char-style-override-7"> (कल्याण)</span> and that all his activities are directed towards doing good to others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus we see that different persons hold different opinions, according to their respective turns of mind, about one and the same activity of one and the same individual at one and the same place and one and the same time. It is just possible that the opinion of one of them may be correct; but at the same time we shall have to admit the fallacy of the others’ judgment. It is thus conclusively proved that a judgment arrived at with the help of the mind and intellect, cannot be regarded as correct.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A certain individual has a leaning towards a particular religion; but shortly afterwards he begins to entertain a dislike for it and a liking for another. This proves that a conclusion arrived at with the help of the mind and intellect, so long as they are not purified, cannot be regarded as correct. Even the most clever people find themselves at their wit’s end in these matters, to say nothing of an ordinary individual. The opinions of those alone are correct who have a pure mind and who have realized God through their own self. So long as they do not realize God, the ignorant people are haunted by several doubts even in respect of the eternal existence of their own self. There is no wonder then, that they should entertain doubts about God, this and the other world, the scriptures and saints.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Doubt, speculation, faith and conviction etc., have the mind and intellect as their seat. Because the mind and intellect are changeable, faith and opinions also change from time to time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In dreams which are occasioned by a disturbed sleep one sees different kinds of objects and regards them for the time being, as real and manifest <span class="char-style-override-7">(प्रत्यक्ष);</span> but he begins to call them unreal when he wakes to find them totally absent. Similarly, in our waking life we mistake unreal objects to be real, through ignorance <span class="char-style-override-7">(अज्ञान).</span> That is why, so long as our mind and intellect are not pure and steady, the inference and conclusions arrived at with their help are not correct.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As compared with the objects whose existence is proved by the intellect, the vividness of objects intuitively realized by the self, is superior. For instance, a man knows about himself that he certainly exists. This conviction of his does not cease at any time, past, present or future, in any of the three stages of his life, viz., waking life, dream and sleep, and in any of the three bodies, the physical <span class="char-style-override-7">(स्थूल),</span> the astral <span class="char-style-override-7">(सूक्ष्म)</span> and the causal <span class="char-style-override-7">(कारण).</span> That alone is true <span class="char-style-override-7">(सत्)</span> which exists forever. Our own self is externally true because it persists at all times. And the experiences of this alone are true. Direct realization of God is possible only through the self. It is only when the self is detached from the mind and the intellect and attached to God that the latter is truly realized. That is true realization. It does not admit of error. That is why the vividness of intuition is regarded as superior to that of a perception arrived at through our mind and intellect. Those who have truly realized God say like that.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Not with standing the fact that all the three bodies in all the three stages are constantly undergoing change, the soul continues to remain immutable <span class="char-style-override-7">(निर्विकार)</span> and uniform <span class="char-style-override-7">(एकरस).</span> Similarly the soul does not change, while changing bodies in rebirth:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā II. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Just as boyhood, youth and old age are attributed to the soul through this body even so it attains another body. The wise man does not get deluded about this.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the Bhagavadgītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उत्क्रामन्तं स्थितं वापि भुञ्जानं वा गुणान्वितम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विमूढा नानुपश्यन्ति पश्यन्ति ज्ञानचक्षुष:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">यतन्तो योगिनश्चैनं पश्यन्त्यात्मन्यवस्थितम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यतन्तोऽप्यकृतात्मानो नैनं पश्यन्त्यचेतस:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XV. 10-11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The ignorant do not perceive the soul departing from, or dwelling in, the body, enjoying the objects of sense, or endowed with the three attributes. Only those, who possess the eye of wisdom, know it in reality. Even striving Yogīs are able to know the self dwelling in their heart. The ignorant, however, whose hearts have not been purified, perceive him not, even though striving.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In ordinary individuals we do not find even the knowledge of past events in an adequate measure. We are unable to recall to our mind many an event of recent occurrence. There is no wonder, then, that we should forget very old incidents. No one generally remembers the incidents of one’s infancy, when he was only two or three years of age. We see that almost everyone of us experiences great pain at the time of birth and almost everyone cries on account of that pain; but no one has any recollection of those cries or of that pain. How, then, can anyone retain a memory of one’s existence in the state of a foetus? Under these circumstances there cannot be a greater folly than regarding the existence of a prenatal life as dependent on our recollection of the incidents of that life. It is thus conclusively proved that the changes in our body in the shape of a boyhood, youth and old age, do not entail a change in the soul. Similarly, change of body does not involve a change in the soul. The soul is therefore immutable and that which is immutable is eternal. That which is eternal is real and that real substance is God. God constitutes the self of all, as the individual soul is His part and parcel <span class="char-style-override-7">(अंश):</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā X. 20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, I am the Self seated in the heart of all beings; so I am the beginning and middle and also the end of all beings.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, it is proved beyond doubt that God is changeless, unborn, imperishable, eternal and unquestionably true.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The  Divine  Law  of  Retribution<br/>is Full of Mercy</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is an illimitable, endless and unfathomable ocean of mercy. Whatever He does is fraught with mercy for His creatures. This, however, does not mean that He is unjust or that His mercy encourages His creatures to commit sins. The fact of the matter is that His laws are of a deterrent nature and the punishment or reward which is provided therein is full of mercy. The domestic laws framed by the head of a family and the national or political laws enacted by a ruler are also full of mercy; but that mercy is limited that may also have some selfish motive concealed behind it, or the head of a family or nation may, through an error of judgment, frame a law which may be prejudicial to the best interests of the family or nation or country. In their laws there is room for error, which may be due to personal likes and dislikes, egoism and limited knowledge. None of these can be predicated of God. That is why the divine code is free from error and ambiguity and full of wisdom and love. He who has grasped the real import of the divine laws through His grace, applies himself in right earnest of the task of regulating his life according to the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">His soul is gradually flooded with Love of God <span class="char-style-override-7">(ईश्वरप्रेम),</span> fearlessness <span class="char-style-override-7">(निर्भयता)</span>, tranquillity<span class="char-style-override-7"> (शान्ति)</span> and joy <span class="char-style-override-7">(आनन्द)</span> and in the end he attains his goal by realizing God. Now, let us consider the nature of the divine laws. On careful consideration we find that the main object to be served by the divine code is—to ensure the all-round progress of all creatures and to secure them the highest good.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All his laws have been so framed as to enable the individual soul to attain this goal easily. He alone can, as a matter of fact, follow these laws easily who has unflinching faith in, and supreme love for, God. Once, a man has acquired unflinching faith in, and supreme love for, God, he naturally imbibes and develops good morals and other commendable virtues and his immoral tendencies and other vices are eradicated. The rules of conduct which have been described in the scriptures as constituting good morals should be regarded as commendable and the vices which have been enumerated as bad morals should be regarded as forbidden in the eyes of the divine law. In brief, the following are the items of good conduct:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Harmlessness <span class="char-style-override-7">(अहिंसा), </span>truthfulness <span class="char-style-override-7">(सत्य),</span> austerity <span class="char-style-override-7">(तप),</span> self-denial <span class="char-style-override-7">(त्याग),</span> refraining from unlawful possession of others’ property <span class="char-style-override-7">(अस्तेय),</span> control of one’s sexual appetite <span class="char-style-override-7">(ब्रह्मचर्य),</span> non-acquisition of property <span class="char-style-override-7">(अपरिग्रह),</span> sacrifice <span class="char-style-override-7">(यज्ञ)</span>, service <span class="char-style-override-7">(सेवा),</span> carrying out the behests of holy men etc., compassion <span class="char-style-override-7">(दया),</span> purity of body and mind <span class="char-style-override-7">(शौच),</span> composure of the mind <span class="char-style-override-7">(शम),</span> control of senses <span class="char-style-override-7">(दम),</span> equanimity <span class="char-style-override-7">(समता),</span> forgiveness <span class="char-style-override-7">(क्षमा),</span> cheerfulness <span class="char-style-override-7">(प्रसन्नता),</span> wisdom <span class="char-style-override-7">(ज्ञान), </span>detachment from worldly objects <span class="char-style-override-7">(वैराग्य),</span> and absence of pride <span class="char-style-override-7">(निरभिमानता)</span> are some of the commendable virtues <span class="char-style-override-7">(सद्गुण).</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Violence <span class="char-style-override-7">(हिंसा),</span> untruth<span class="char-style-override-7"> (असत्य),</span> unlawful possession of others’ property, illicit love, taking prohibited food <span class="char-style-override-7">(अभक्ष्यभक्षण)</span> and intoxicating drugs or draught, indulging in idle or useless occupation <span class="char-style-override-7">(प्रमाद),</span> speaking ill of others <span class="char-style-override-7">(निन्दा),</span> gambling <span class="char-style-override-7">(द्यूत),</span> using harsh or unpleasant language <span class="char-style-override-7">(कटुभाषण)</span> etc., are some of the items of conduct constituting bad morals.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lust <span class="char-style-override-7">(काम),</span> anger <span class="char-style-override-7">(क्रोध),</span> avarice<span class="char-style-override-7"> (लोभ),</span> indiscretion<span class="char-style-override-7"> (अविवेक),</span> pride <span class="char-style-override-7">(अभिमान),</span> hypocrisy <span class="char-style-override-7">(दम्भ),</span> jealousy<span class="char-style-override-7"> (मत्सरता),</span> sloth <span class="char-style-override-7">(आलस्य),</span> fear <span class="char-style-override-7">(भय)</span> and grief <span class="char-style-override-7">(शोक)</span> constitute some of the vices. Good morals breed virtues and vice-versa. The two are interdependent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To observe good morals and to practise virtues is to abide by the divine laws, whereas to develop bad morals and to indulge in vices is to infringe those laws. One who abides by these laws merits reward, while he who violates them deserves punishment. Of course, the divine retribution, too, is full of mercy: we shall deal with this later. Here we have to emphasize the fact that the divine code is fraught with infinite mercy. Let us briefly discuss this point. By practising non-violence one becomes free from enmity <span class="char-style-override-7">(निर्वैर)</span> and fearless; by practising truthfulness one attains God who is an embodiment of truth; by refraining from unlawful possession of others’ property one earns the confidence of others; by controlling one’s sexual appetite one gathers physical and moral stamina; by refusing to accumulate possessions one increases the stock of one’s wisdom; by performing sacrifices and practising austerity one acquires mastery over one’s senses and purifies one’s inner self; by practising self-denial, doing service and carrying out the behests of holy men one eradicates one’s weaknesses, imbibes and develops the different virtues such as composure of one’s mind and control of one’s senses and thereby realizes God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The immense good that is done to one’s self in this as well as the next world by the observance of the above rules of good conduct is one of the good features of the divine dispensation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is due to ignorance that one brings harm to one’s own self as well as to others by having recourse to such evil practices as telling lies, resorting to underhand dealings <span class="char-style-override-7">(कपट),</span> committing thefts and indulging in illicit love. Such evil practices, and vicious tendencies prove highly prejudicial to one’s own self as well as to the world at large and destroys the peace and happiness of all. It is with a view to saving the world from this degradation that the Lord has declared these practices as forbidden and deprecable. This prohibitive injunction is also full of mercy. For those who do not obey the prohibitive injunction through ignorance and commit the sin of disobeying the divine laws a merciful code has been framed. The punishment that is generally awarded to those who infringe the said laws is somewhat of the following type:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Depriving the wrong-doer of such objects of enjoyment as are already available to him, stopping entirely or diminishing <br/>the influx of such objects in future or rendering him unfit for their enjoyment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, let us consider how benevolent and merciful this dispensation is. How harmful the association of worldly enjoyments is, will be evident from a consideration of the following points:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(a) Enjoyment of worldly pleasures spoils our habits.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(b) One who is given to the enjoyment of worldly pleasures cannot tread the path of God-realization and in the event of his stepping into it, there is fear of a downfall.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(c) Super-abundance of worldly enjoyments begets diseases, destroys bodily happiness and impairs the constitution.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d) It awakens the evil and pollutes the mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(e) Sensual pleasures appear as enjoyable only through ignorance. As a matter of fact, they are unpleasant in the long<span> </span>run.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(f) Enjoyment of sensual pleasures exhausts our merits and multiplies our sins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(g) Worldly pleasures cannot be enjoyed without <br/>some form of activity <span class="char-style-override-7">(आरम्भ)</span> and there is no activity that does not involve infliction of pain on others<span class="char-style-override-7"> (हिंसा) </span>and the latter is harmful to the world at large and brings affliction to the agents themselves.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To deprive one of worldly enjoyments which are miseries in disguise and to arrest or diminish their influx in future, is to avert in a way the present and future miseries. Just as to remove the lamp from before the eyes of a moth who is bent upon hugging its flame or to put it out or to put some hindrance in the way of the moth’s approaching it constitutes an act of mercy, so does God commit an act of great mercy by depriving His creatures of worldly enjoyments by way of punishment for their misdeeds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In some cases, instead of depriving the wrong-doer of his beloved objects such as a wife or a son in requital of his sins, He causes those dear and near ones to behave in such a way as to prove a source of annoyance to him. He is not only absolved from his sins by thus reaping their unpleasant consequences but the hostile, nay, sometimes defiant attitude of those people slackens the bond of attachment with them and creates a feeling of detachment, which in its turn withdraws the mind from all worldly attachments and in some cases leads the man on to the path of God-realization and thus enables him to attain abiding peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To some, God sends diseases and other calamities as a result of their sins. Afflicted by them, they make piteous appeals to God; nay, some of them in utter grief invoke His succour for ending their woe, like the famous elephant <span class="char-style-override-7">(गजेन्द्र)</span> of the legend. By doing so, they are not only rid of their troubles, but also attain the love of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In some cases the Almighty deprives the wrong-doer of honour, dignity and good name and thereby does him really a lot of good. For honour, prestige and good name brings about the downfall of even some of the wisest persons. The ignorant hug these venomous notions as something very pleasant and attractive. The merciful God deprives them of these for their good as an act of mercy. To deprive them of the pleasure of receiving honour and homage, is a great blessing in the guise of a curse. For they are great stumbling blocks in the path of God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the case of others it is so ordained by God in requital of their sins that they find it difficult even to make the two ends meet. They live from hand to mouth and are ill-fed and ill-clad. They therefore, feel miserable and in their affliction cry out to God. Besides this, they shake of lethargy and pride, indolence and inertia, and resort to industry and labour which drive away their indolence, crush the false notion of dignity and banish their slothfulness and pride.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, every act of divine retribution is full of infinite mercy. Just as by diving in a deep ocean abounding in pearls one can lay one’s hands on most precious pearls; so by intellectually diving in the ocean of divine grace as manifested in the law of retribution one can lay one’s hands on priceless gems beneficial alike in this as well as the next world. Thus it is proved that the divine law of retribution is full of mercy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Every object in this world is either agreeable or disagreeable to a particular individual. We consider <br/>ourselves to be the recipients of divine favour when we acquire an object which is liked by us. We derive peace and happiness therefrom and begin to love that object. When we are confronted with some unpleasant situation or object, we out of ignorance, look upon it as a token of displeasure and are thereby thrown into the whirlpool of sorrow and misery and begin to entertain a dislike for that object or situation. But he who knows the real nature of the all-powerful, all-merciful, all-wise God, who is the greatest friend of us all, overcomes all sorrow and infatuation and attains the highest peace and <br/>fearlessness. One is simply enraptured as soon as one is able to unravel the mystery of His laws. Every single law of God absolves the sinner from his sins and rids <br/>the afflicted of his affliction. He never helps one in multiplying one’s sins. The sins of that person who has not been able to understand the divine nature and under the belief that God is merciful resorts to new sins on the strength of divine mercy, become so deep-rooted that it is not possible to expiate them even by such penitential acts as the repetition of certain incantations (<span class="char-style-override-7">जप</span>), meditation (<span class="char-style-override-7">ध्यान</span>), etc. They are exhausted only by reaping their fruit and not otherwise. Nay, they constitute a great hindrance in the way of his applying himself to meditation, adoration, etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those who know the true nature of divine mercy and justice enjoy immense pleasure and peace when they are brought face to face with something not to their liking. Their feelings on that occasion are altogether different from the feelings of those ignorant persons who derive happiness and peace only from the acquisition of worldly enjoyments. They feel that:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) It is dispensation of God who is just and merciful and who is the dearest of all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) Contact with objects which are unpleasant or disagreeable in the eyes of the world, absolve them from past sins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) By enduring diseases as an act of supreme austerity they are absolved from the accumulated sins of past lives and the mind becomes as pure and stainless as gold.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) One begins to exercise greater vigilance in obeying the divine injunction of refraining from forbidden and sinful deeds and is thus saved from future sins. By reaping the fruit of past sins, he is absolved from those sins which had begun to fructify (<span class="char-style-override-7">प्रारब्ध</span>); by enjoying their fruit as an act of penance, his mind is purified; he is saved from sins at the present moment and even absolved from the accumulated (<span class="char-style-override-7">संचित</span>) sins of past lives and is also successful in guarding against future sins by refraining from forbidden acts. In this way he altogether freed from sins and becomes devotee of God. In adversity the faithful remembers God more frequently than ever and there is no easier method of God-realization than the remembrance of God. A devotee said:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुखके माथे सिल पड़ो (जो) नाम हृदयसे जाय।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बलिहारी वा दु:ख की (जो) पल-पल नाम रटाय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Damn prosperity which puts God’s name out of mind. Blessed is the adversity which makes one repeat His name every moment.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It behoves us all, therefore, to try to understand the hidden meaning of the divine law and mould our lives according to the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By obeying the laws framed by our parents, master or preceptor we can acquire only those limited objects which are within their power to confer; by obeying the laws of the all-merciful God, however, we can be freed from all sins and attain the summum bonum of human existence.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Love of God Includes Universal Love</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is infinite and illimitable. The whole universe consisting of mobile and immobile creatures is contained in a fragment <span class="char-style-override-7">(अंश)</span> of God and rests on His <span class="char-style-override-8">Saṅkalpa</span> alone. He evolves and dissolves the universe by dint of His enrapturing power<span class="char-style-override-7"> (योगमाया).</span> The universe comes into being with the idea of God and is dissolved or disappears as soon as He abandons the idea. Just as a dreaming person creates a world of his own within himself on the basis of his own imagination or idea, so does God create the universe while abiding in His own self. The only difference between the two is that while the dreamer is in state of ignorance and has to depend on others, God is knowledge itself and is independent in everyway. Hence this universe is manifested in a fragment of God in the same way as tiny star twinkles in the limitless expanse of the sky. The analogy of the sky has been taken simply to make the point clear, as a matter of fact, the infinitude of the sky is comparatively small, limited as it is by time and space. The infinitude of God, on the other hand, is altogether unlimited, as He is beyond the conception of time and space. The infinitude of the sky is contained in a fragment of His Idea in the same way as the world of dream subsists in a fragment of the dreamer’s imagination. The infinitude of God cannot be illustrated by any worldly object, because there is nothing analogous to God in this world. To adopt another popular analogy all the countless millions of solar systems are contained in a single hair on the body of God, although, as a matter of fact, the God of which we are speaking here, is devoid of limbs<span class="char-style-override-7"> (निरवयव)</span>and hence He cannot be said to be endowed with hair. But there is no alternative but to fall back upon these worldly illustrations for satisfying the human intellect which is as worldly as anything else. Thus, whatever divine principle is elucidated with the help of some worldly illustration is only partially explained. Really speaking, it is not possible to explain it even partially. We have, therefore, to console ourselves with the apology that it is extremely difficult to grasp and explain the divine principle which is a matter of experience only, as it is very profound and mysterious and can be comprehended only through the Divine Grace. The Lord has said in the Bhagavadgītā :—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेन-</p>
<p class="Shlok">माश्चर्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्य:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Hardly anyone perceives this soul as marvellous, scarce another likewise speaks thereof as marvellous.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, when even those noble souls who have realized the divine truth find it difficult to explain it to others, it is out of question for others to do it with any amount of success. To explain a thing is the function of speech, which is at a loss to describe the nature of God to the same extent as it is grasped by the intellect and, as a matter of fact, the divine nature cannot be fully comprehended even by the intellect. In spite of all this an insight into this reality has been facilitated by utterances of holy men. But owing to deficiency of faith, love, concentration, acuteness of intellect and purity of mind, a large majority of the listeners are unable to grasp the truth. That is why this subject is so difficult to grasp and explain. But this much should be borne in mind that Primordial Matter or Māyā subsists in a fragment of that infinite divinity who is knowledge and bliss combined and the whole of this phenomenal world, consisting of animate and inanimate creation, subsists in a fragment of that Māyā. Under such circumstances the love which has God for its object automatically embraces the whole universe. For God is the mainstay of whole universe. He is its very soul, nay, He pervades everything and is the sole cause (material as well as efficient) of the universe. He is the whole of which the entire universe is a part, a component part. The Lord Himself spoke to Arjuna  thus:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अथवा बहुनैतेन किं ज्ञातेन तवार्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विष्टभ्याहमिदं कृत्स्नमेकांशेन स्थितो जगत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā X. 42)</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-4">“Or, what will you gain by knowing all this in detail, Arjuna? Suffice it to say that I stand holding this entire universe by a spark of My Yogic power.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One who has grasped the meaning of the above assertion is convinced that the entire universe subsists in a fragment of the Lord, and that it is the Lord who is manifested in the form of the universe. Under such circumstances a lover of God naturally begins to love the universe as well. One who has comprehended the reality of gold undoubtedly begins to love gold ornaments: he can never ignore them. This requires no proof. And if he does so, he has surely not understood the nature of gold. Similarly, one who has understood the divine nature and loves God can never ignore His creatures.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A person who devoutly and lovingly adores all the limbs of one whom he reveres, can never burn a part of any particular limb or lop off any other limb, however small it may be. For him every limb of the revered person is adorable and lovable. In the same way is it possible for one who knows the reality of God and loves Him, to bear a grudge towards any creature what so ever, which is like a fragment or limb of his beloved God, or to harm it or inflict pain on it? No, never. Therefore he who loves God is naturally a lover of the whole universe. Just as a man who, though lovingly worshipping all the limbs of the object of his veneration, burns a particular limb is neither a devotee, nor a lover, nor a true worshipper, in the same way a lover of God who does the least harm to any creature or inflicts pain on it, is neither a devotee, nor a lover, nor a true worshipper of God. As a matter of fact, he has not understood the real nature of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One who knows the real nature of God, is surely a lover of the universe; but this should not be taken to mean that love of God and universal love are co-extensive terms. For the divine reality extends even beyond the universe and is infinite and endless. Of course, inasmuch as the universe is contained in fragment of God, universal love is also included in love of God. As a matter of fact, love of God embraces the whole of His being, including the universe.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The nature<span class="char-style-override-7"> (प्रकृति)</span> of God is twofold, the material and the spiritual. The Lord has termed them in the Bhagavadgītā as the lower <span class="char-style-override-7">(अपरा)</span> and the higher <span class="char-style-override-7">(परा)</span> nature. The former consists of ether <span class="char-style-override-7">(आकाश),</span> air<span class="char-style-override-7"> (वायु),</span> light <span class="char-style-override-7">(तेज),</span> water <span class="char-style-override-7">(जल)</span>, earth<span class="char-style-override-7"> (पृथिवी),</span> mind <span class="char-style-override-7">(मनस्),</span> intellect <span class="char-style-override-7">(बुद्धि)</span> and egoism<span class="char-style-override-7"> (अहंकार).</span> The universe consisting of the twenty-four elements has evolved out of this lower nature. The individual soul <span class="char-style-override-7">(जीवात्मा)</span> or Spirit, as it is called, constitutes the higher nature and sustains the other nature. The embodied soul (life) is also of two kinds, the moving<span class="char-style-override-7"> (चर)</span> and the motionless <span class="char-style-override-7">(अचर).</span> Human beings, animals, birds, etc., are included in the first category, and trees, plants, creepers, etc., in the second. The whole creation, consisting of the two aforesaid natures, is what we call the universe. Even he who loves the world with some ulterior motive, loves God, although his love is of an inferior type. The love which has some ulterior motive behind it, ceases as soon as the motive is realized: It is called inferior because it is limited by time and space and because its result is also inferior. The broad, exclusive love of God, includes only that love of the universe which is preceded by a knowledge of the divine nature and embraces the whole of the universe, including animate and inanimate beings, and is of a disinterested nature. Although even this type of love is limited by time and space, it is accompanied by a knowledge of reality and free from desire and hence is regarded as true and commendable. The real and highest love of God is that which embraces the infinite divinity unlimited by time and space and including the animate and inanimate creation and is divorced from any ulterior motive.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now let us consider what sort of love we should have for the animate and inanimate creation, the higher and lower natures of God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Love for Sentient Creatures<br/>Consists in:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) Rendering motiveless help, bodily, mental as well as monetary, according to one’s capacity, to those creatures (human beings) who are eligible for salvation in achieving real progress in this as well as the next world and attaining the highest Bliss.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) Rendering disinterested help, bodily, mental and monetary, according to one’s capacity, to animals, birds and other creatures who are, as a rule, debarred from attaining knowledge of the Self, with a view to preserving and nourishing them and promoting their welfare.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3)  Looking after trees, plants, creepers, etc., in a disinterested way.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Love for Insentient Creation  <br/>Consists in :—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) Striving for the advancement, growth and protection of those objects which are useful to living beings and helpful in the development of noble qualities and healthy activities and making right use of them without attachment and desire simply with a view to guiding the masses, and—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) Striving for the diminution and destruction of those objects which are harmful to living creatures and promote vices and immoral activities and giving them up without hatred and desire, merely with a view to guiding the public.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as to multiply, preserve and partake of useful objects, is, to love them similarly, to destroy and shun harmful objects, is also to love them. The interests of the latter are served by their being wiped out of existence and love consists in promoting one’s interests.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way, to draw away the mind, intellect, egoism as well as all the senses from immoral conduct, vices and worldly enjoyments and to incline them towards devotion and engage them in pursuits connected with God, with a view to promoting virtues is to love them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">An aspirant<span class="char-style-override-7"> (साधक)</span> should love all these with a view to realizing God, while those who have attained perfection should do so with a view to guiding the public. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus love of the universe is included in love of God. The former accompanies the latter as a matter of course. Therefore every human being should make a life-long exertion for developing pure and exclusive love for God. The following are some of the methods of attaining love of God:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) To listen to, ponder over and read and recite the sweet, honey-like anecdotes illustrating the qualities, loving nature, greatness and the real nature of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) To associate with those persons who have faith in God and love Him without any earthly gain.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) To repeat and recite loudly God’s epithets with love, fixing one’s mind at the same time upon His divine nature.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) To obey the divine laws and to remain cheerful under every circumstance, whether favourable or adverse, taking it as a divine dispensation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(5) To strive for the good of all creatures, knowing them to be His fragment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(6) To be eager to grasp His true nature and to get His vision.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(7) To pray to God in seclusion, in piteous tone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By following these methods one can develop pure and exclusive love for God and realize Him directly. He cannot but cherish disinterested love for the universe consisting of the animate and inanimate creation. The Lord has characterized loving devotees who know the divine nature as follows:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्र: करुण एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहंकार: समदु:खसुख: क्षमी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">संतुष्ट: सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XII. 13-14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who is free from malice towards all beings, who is friendly as well as compassionate, who has no feeling of meum and is free from egoism, to whom pleasure and pain are alike and who is forgiving by nature, who is ever content and mentally united to Me, who has subdued his body, mind and senses and has a firm resolve, who has surrendered his mind and intellect to Me—that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">The above exposition establishes beyond doubt that philanthropy (universal love) consists in the love of God.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Is God Open to Perception?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A number of friends have expressed a doubt whether even in this Kali Age it is possible to see God with our own eyes and chat with Him in the same way as two chummies meet and enjoy a hearty talk. If it is possible, they would like to know the method by which they could obtain a vision of that enchanting figure at the earliest moment. They would further like to know whether there was anyone present in this world who had been blessed with a vision of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In fact, only those blessed beings can answer these questions to whom the Lord has revealed His enrapturing form.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though not properly qualified to deal with the subject, I venture to submit the following observations in regard to these questions just by way of amusement, prompted by the good grace of the Lord and His beloved devotees. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) Just as ample evidence is forthcoming to show that Dhruva, Prahlāda and others in the Satyayuga (Golden Age) and the succeeding age where blessed with a vision of the Lord, similarly, the fact that Sµuradāsa and Tulasīdāsa and a number of other devotees belonging to the Kali Age were similarly blessed, is corroborated by history. Nay, in works like Viṣṇupurāṇa visualization of the Deity has been declared as easier in the Kali Age than in the preceding ages. The Bhāgavata also says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कृते यद् ध्यायतो विष्णुं त्रेतायां यजतो मखै:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">द्वापरे परिचर्यायां कलौ तद्धरिकीर्तनात्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XII. iii. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“ The results which are achieved in Satyayuga by meditation on God, in Tretāyuga by performing sacrifices and in Dwāpara by worshipping the Deity, are achieved in the Kali Age by simply reciting His Name”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as fire was used to be kindled for sacrificial purpose in ancient India by rubbing two logs of wood against each other, even so God is manifested as a result of friction caused by the loving invocation of a prayerful heart, i.e., by loud repetition of the Divine names with love. The sage PataÛjali, too, says in his “Aphorisms on Yoga”:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वाध्यायादिष्टदेवतासंप्रयोग:।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Repetition on the names of one’s beloved Deity induces Him to appear in person.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as a Yogī who has completely mastered his will is able to visualize whatever he likes to have before his eyes, even so when one who is truly and exclusively devoted to God, wishes to behold Him, absorbed in His Love, the Lord manifests Himself then and there in whatever form the devotee likes to see Him. The Lord says in the Bhagavadgītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञातुं द्रष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परंतप॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XI. 54)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Through single-minded devotion, however, I can be seen in this Form (with four arms), and known in essence and even entered into, O valiant Arjuna!”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a loving friend is seized with an intense longing to see his beloved and if the latter is apprised of this, he cannot help seeing the former. How, then, can God Himself who is the very embodiment of love, whose deep insight into the mysteries of love is unparalleled, stay without meeting His loving devotees?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus it is proved beyond doubt that the Lord, who is love personified appears before His devotees in all times and in all climes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) Of the various means of visualizing God the most efficacious one is ‘true love’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">True love of God is generated, gradually through association with saints and holy men, remembrance of God, purity of heart, dispassion, indifference to the world, intense longing to see God and pining for Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is a matter for regret that many of us have no faith in the existence of God. There are others who, though believing in God, do not appreciate the greatness and value of seeing the most beloved Lord, being engrossed in false pleasures derived from transient and ephemeral objects of enjoyment. If anyone is able to know something of His greatness by hearing of it and reposing faith in Him, he rests contented with inadequate efforts to realize Him or gives way to despondency after exerting himself a little. He does not strive even as much as one strives for earning money.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some people say that they exerted themselves not a little but could not obtain a vision of the Lord. We would ask them whether they ever strove to escape from the clutches of birth and death even as much as they would for averting a sentence of death, whether they ever tried to meet the Lord with the same eagerness as they would approach a lady-love of whom they are enamoured. If not, their assertion that the Lord does not appear in person is altogether meaningless.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Himself gets absorbed in contemplation of his devotee who is completely merged in His meditation just as He did in the case of Bhīṣma, who was merged in His thought while lying on his bed of arrows. The Lord says in the Bhagavadgītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IV. II)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, howsoever men approach Me, even so do I see them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When by constantly repeating the name of the Lord one begins to experience a thrilling sensation every moment, he is absolved from all his sins and then he loses interest in everything else than God. Being afflicted by pangs of separation he begins to shed tears in a ceaseless stream from his eyes, kicks the wealth of all the three worlds and runs mad after the Lord like the blessed cow-maids of Vr̥ndāvana; and the moment he begins to pine in love for the Lord like fish taken out of water, the blissful Lord manifests Himself in His divine enrapturing form. This is the right way of obtaining a vision of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Anyone who has a genuine desire to see the Lord, should make a loud piteous wail for obtaining a vision of the Lord like Rukmiṇī, Sītā and the cow-maids of Vr̥ndāvana.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) Although such people are not publicly known in this Kali age as may have obtained a vision of the Lord in this way, it cannot be believed that they are altogether absent. For only one among thousands becomes known in the world like Prahlāda and others, for some special reason, otherwise such people have no interest in giving publicity to their revelations.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it be urged that it is advisable to make such facts widely known for the good of the world at large, our reply is that it is difficult to get people with a credulous mind to listen to such experience. And it is difficult for anyone else than a competent soul to repose faith in these things. If one makes such things public without discrimination, they will cease to have any value and no one will believe them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Hence we should believe that such people are doubtless present in the world as have obtained a vision of the Lord in the aforesaid way. It is our lack of faith which is responsible for our not being able to meet them and it is equally profitable for all to believe it rather than not to believe it; for it is faith which is ultimately responsible for generating true love for God, and for enabling one to see the Lord as one goes and meets one’s own friend.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Methods of God-perception</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">True love is the best means of obtaining a vision of the blissful Lord. Now the question is, how this type of love is to be cultivated and what kind of love makes it possible for the Lord to manifest Himself in visible form and bless the devotee with His divine presence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear in visible form before one who meditates on His mental image with an unfluctuating mind undaunted by obstacles, as Dhruva did in the past.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear in visible form before one who is prepared to suffer all sorts of persecutions and cheerfully offer his head to the sharp edge of the sword for the sake of the Divine name, like Prahlāda.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can obtain a vision of the Lord by renouncing wealth and woman and proceeding to the forest for the sake of the Lord as Lakṣmaṇa did.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can obtain a vision of the Lord by roaming about like the sage Sutīkṣṇa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, mad in love of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The immortal Tulasīdāsa graphically describes how the youthful sage is driven into raptures at the news of the advent of śrī Rāma. Lord śiva, who is narrating the story of His Divine Consort, Pārvatī, relates how the sage goes into raptures over the prospect of beholding the divine countenance of śrī Rāmacandra, the very sight of which liberates the soul from its coils of birth and death. The sage knows not in what direction he is moving and what road he has taken. Nay, he has forgotten his own self and has no idea where he is going. Now he turns back and proceeds in the opposite direction and now he resumes the same direction. Sometimes he begins to dance and sing praises to the Lord, his attachment and devotion to Him is so deep and solid. The Lord conceals Himself behind a tree and witnesses this rare spectacle. He cannot contain Himself for a long time, the intense love of the devotee compels Him to appear before his inward eye. The sage gets absorbed in meditation and sits motionless on the roadway like a statue. His whole frame is thrilled with joy and appears like a jackfruit on account of its bristling hair. The Lord of Raghus now draws near and is delighted to find His devotee in that ecstatic condition. The Lord, who is naturally disposed to relieve the distress and want of His devotees, accosts the sage in loving accents and asks him to get up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can meet the Lord face to face by devoutly and lovingly surrendering himself to Him like śrī Hanumān.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can obtain a vision of the Lord by going mad in Love for the Lord and yearning for His sight like Prince Bharata.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa has in his own masterly way portrayed the ecstatic condition of Bharata, who may be called the very incarnation of love, at the expiry of the period of śrī Rāma’s exile (which extended to fourteen years).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharata was seized with dismay when he came to realize that the period of śrī Rāma’s exile was going to expire only a day after whereas the Lord had not turned up till then, which he could not account for. He therefore wondered whether the Lord had forgotten him on account of his crooked nature. He envied the lot of his younger brother, Lakṣmaṇa who had focussed his love on the lotus-feet of śrī Rāma. The Lord had surely discovered his deceitful and crooked nature, thought he: that was why He did not take him along with Him. It was no doubt true, he admitted, that, if the Lord took notice of his conduct and paid him his deserts, there could be no hope of His redemption even in millions of Kalpas or revolutions of creation and destruction of the world. The Lord, however, never took notice of the faults of His servants, a befriender of the poor and extremely tender-hearted that He was. He was therefore perfectly sure that the Lord would certainly meet him and the omens also confirmed his belief. If, however, he survived even after the expiry of the period of exile, there could be no greater sinner than he in this world. In this way Bharata was going to succumb to the anguish of separation from śrī Rāma, when śrī Hanumān, the monkey-god, made his appearance on the scene in the disguise of a Brāhmaṇa, just like a ship that comes to rescue a drowning man. śrī Hanumān found him sitting on a mattress of straw with a tuft of matted hair on his head and the name of the Lord of Raghus on his lips and with tears streaming forth from his lotus-like eyes and bathing his emaciated frame.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The following is the description of the meeting of śrī Rāma with Bharata after the latter’s conversation with śrī Hanumān.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Tears gushed forth from the lotus-like eyes of śrī Rāma and His whole frame bristled with joy; the Lord of the three worlds hugged His loving brother to His bosom with great affection. It looked as if grace and love had appeared in human form and locked each other in loving embrace. The merciful Lord enquires after the welfare of Bharata and finds Himself tongue-tied. The joy that flowed from this meeting, is beyond the ken of speech and mind and can be known only by those who experience it. Bharata replied that he was quite happy, now that the Lord of Ayodhyā had blessed him with His sight and taking compassion on his wretched plight, helped him by His own hands out of the unfathomable ocean of separation in which he was just going to be submerged.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear in visible form before one who, having relinquished the sense of honour and dignity, rolls on the dust containing the impressions of the lotus-feet of śrī Hari, like śrī Akrµura of the Bhāgavata. Of him it is said in śrīmad Bhāgavata:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He noticed in the cow-pen the footprints of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the dust of whose feet is kissed by the diadems of all the guardian deities of the different worlds constituting the universe—footprints which adorned the face of the earth and could be easily recognized by the marks of lotus, barley, goad, etc., borne on the same. He was overwhelmed with joy at the sight of these footprints: a thrill ran through his whole body and his eyes were blinded with tears. He alighted from the chariot and, recognizing that the ground he was treading bore the footprints of the Lord, he began to roll thereon in ecstasy of joy.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The fulfilment of earthly existence lies in looking on and hearing about the footprints and other symbols of the Lord under the advice of one’s preceptor, just as Akrµura did.” (X. xxxviii. 25—27)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can be perceived by getting mad in love for Him like Uddhava who shook off his pride of wisdom or enlightenment on seeing the love of the cow-maids of Vr̥ndāvana.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear before us if we cry for Him from the bottom of our heart like Rukmiṇī to whom every moment that passed without Him was like the day of final destruction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear before a loving devotee who does not hesitate even to saw the head of his own son, when the occasion demands it, like the celebrated king Mayµuradhwaja, who had taken a vow to carry out the behests of sages and seers, whatever cost he might have to pay for the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord can appear before one who like the great Bhakta Narasī Mehatā shakes off all sense of decorum, honour, fame and fear and roams about singing praises to the Lord in ecstasy of love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can obtain a vision of the Lord by passing the necessary tests in the nine forms or stages of Bhakti just as we pass university examinations.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord not only appears in visible form but can partake of the food offered to Him with love just as He did in the case of Draupadī, Gajarāja, the celebrated leader of the herd of elephants, śabarī, Vidµura and others.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Lord says in <br/>śrīmad Bhagavadgītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whosoever offers to Me with love a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water, I appear in person before that disinterested devotee of purified intellect, and delightfully partake of that article offered by him with love” (X. 26).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Hence it behoves everyone of us to pine for the sight of the Lord with supreme love and intense yearning.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Some Methods of God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Self-sacrifice is the prime requisite in all spheres of activity. Through self-sacrifice the meanest of creatures may attain blessedness by pursuing any form of activity sanctioned by the scriptures. Of worldly enjoyments one should partake of only as much as is barely necessary for the maintenance of the body. If that is not possible, the blessed state may be attained even by shaking off attachment for enjoyments.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever you do, do it in a strictly impersonal way. Let not the sense of ‘I’ overtake you when you perform any laudable action.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Beatitude may be attained even by worshipping an image of God at one’s home with true Devotion and singing praises of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Retire regularly to lonely and secluded place everyday and try to banish all thoughts of the world from the mind for the time being. When the world is thus forgotten even for the time being, the conscious Self, or the Atmā alone will remain. Meditate on this Self. Such meditation will bring Samādhi (absorption), and Samādhi will bring emancipation.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Take a vow to perform in a disinterested spirit only such actions with your body as are conducive to the welfare of others. There is no duty more sacred than this. Bhagavān śrī Rāmacandra says in the Rāmacaritamānasa:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>“O brother, there is no duty so sacred as doing good to </span><span>others; and there is nothing so ignoble as oppressing others.”</span><span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">पर पीड़ा सम नहिं अधमाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By observing this rule alone, one may obtain emancipation from the trammels of worldly existence.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the mind and the senses are under control, meditation on God, is the best method of attaining blessedness. If, however, the mind and the senses are not under control, one should take recourse to practices such as fasting and other religious observances, not with any ulterior motive, but only for the benefit of the soul. We should seek nothing else from God than His own Realization. God may be realized through such disinterested practices. In short, practice of Yoga should be resorted to when the mind and the senses are under control. Or else fasting and other austerities should be practised without any worldly motive, and merely for God-realization. But the easiest of all these methods is the practice of Devotion (Bhakti).</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Divine Name should be repeated at all times, and in all conditions. It should never be allowed to slip out of the mind. This is the easiest method of God-realization. Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa says in his Rāmacaritamānasa:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is through remembrance of the sacred Name that the child of wind-god (Hanumān) has made śrī Rāma (God) subservient to his will, the ill-famed Ajāmila, the Lord of elephants and the harlot of puranic fame attained salvation through the power of the Name.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">There is one more discipline the pursuit of which gives us joy at every moment and which, moreover, does not involve any exertion on our part. This practice is known as the practice of seeing joy everywhere—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">आनन्दमयोऽभ्यासात्</span>’, joy (Bliss) is an integral part of God. There is joy all around, joy inside and joy outside; the whole creation is full of joy and joy alone. If you do not actually realize this go on repeating this through speech and recognize this fact with your mind. Just as a swimmer floats on water and dives into it, even so float in the river of joy and take a plunge into it. Remain absorbed in joy day and night. Even if death occurs of any of your relations, or your house catches fire, or something equally untoward happens, there should be joy and joy alone; whatever may happen, this joy should never be disturbed. Through this practice all sorrow and suffering is easily got rid of. Let the speech indulge in talks of joy, let the mind dwell on joy and joy alone, let the intellect analyse joy and nothing else; but if you do not actually experience joy, try to feel it by sheer force of imagination. Even imaginary joy produces very good results; for <br/>it leads ultimately to God-realization. This practice is open to every individual. It is stated that in the medieval times, when Mohammedan kings ruled over India, the Hindus were asked merely to get themselves enrolled as Mohammedans and declare themselves as such without renouncing their faith or embracing Islam and without giving up Hindu practices and observances, adding that they were to lose nothing thereby. The Hindus played into this trick and accepted the thin end of the wedge. After a generation, Kazi taught the children of these nominal converts that they were true Muslims and asked them to adopt the practices of the Islamic faith. The result was that in course of time the descendants of those so-called Muslims became bigoted Musalamans. Similarly, we should all firmly believe that we are all joy (Bliss) and nothing else. When this is firmly impressed on our mind, we shall have joy and joy alone.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Place an image or picture of the Lord in front of you, and keeping the eyes open fix them on the eyes of the image or the picture. Meditate on the form of the Lord in this way and while doing so firmly believe that God will reveal Himself through the image or the picture. Such meditation practised with full faith may lead to God-<br/>realization. This is also an easy method of God-realization.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever objects of the world you see, tree or stone, man, beast or bird, persuade yourself to believe that God Himself has assumed all these forms. Then ask the mind to go wherever it pleases, all the forms of the world being nothing but representations of God Himself. All  that you see is a manifestation of Nārāyaṇa, the Paramātmā (Oversoul). Mentally bow to every object of the world that comes before your eyes, believing that God Himself has appeared before you in that form. This practice of seeing infinite forms of the world as only so many manifestations of the same God, may also lead to God-realization. Thousands of such methods have been suggested in the scriptures, out of which the Sādhaka has to select and adopt that which appears easy to him. The adoption and practice of anyone of these methods may lead to final beatitude. Knowing that all that exists is God, one will begin to look upon everything with an equal eye. This one simple practice, if diligently pursued, may bring him salvation.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mental dispositions are of two kinds, which are represented by likes and dislikes. That which is agreeable to the mind is liked by the mind, and that which is repellent to it is disliked by it. Anything which is agreeable to the mind will naturally bring delight to it and that which is unpalatable to it will bring sorrow. Now treat this sorrow, when it comes, as a boon from God and thus divest it of its disagreeable character. Try to persuade yourself that whatever happens is prompted by the will of God. Not a leaf can stir without the will of God. We on our part rejoice in favourable circumstances and shun what appears unfavourable to us. How can we realize God when such is the condition of our mind? We should learn to rejoice in whatever may please God. Of course, there can be no difficulty in adopting this attitude in favourable circumstances; nay, we should try to view unpropitious events as propitious. It should be remembered that such events  cannot be unwelcome to God, for in that case they could not have happened. This one single practice will suffice to bring us within easy reach of salvation. We shall then have joy and nothing but joy forever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the above Sādhanā appears difficult to practice, one should practise observance of Truth. Let him be truthful in speech, truthful in his dealings, and truthful in his conduct. This also will lead to salvation. A Hindi poet says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“There is no penance equal to truth, no sin equal to lying; he whose heart is truthful, carries God within his heart.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* साँच बराबर तप नहीं, झूठ बराबर पाप।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">जाके हिरदै साँच है, ताके हिरदै आप॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Practice of Truth, though difficult, is bound to lead to God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the objects of this world in their visible form are  really evanescent in character. Their real character is visible to our eyes. Look upon all these objects with an equal eye. Make no differentiation among them. Do not  discriminate between one object and another. If you cannot recognize the world as a manifestation of God, at  least remove the sense of discrimination there from. Just  as you treat the body as your own and do not view it  apart from your self, nor do you discriminate between one part and another, even so do not discriminate between one individual and another. View all with an equal eye, remove all sense of difference among them. Beatitude may be attained even through the removal of  this sense of difference. If you cannot remember God, try to pursue this discipline.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If this too is not possible, treat every sound that you hear, such as the sound of the fall of the Ganges or of the blowing of winds or the sound of ordinary birds and  beasts as a verbal manifestation of God. This, too, is an easy method of attaining blessedness. Whatever sound you hear, know it to be a manifestation of God Himself—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘नादो ब्रह्म’</span> (Sound is God). In fact, whatever we hear is God. If you hear someone abusing you or blessing you, know both these kinds of sound to be God. But if we are pained to hear abusive language used in respect of us, we cannot be said to have recognized sound as God. The moment we come to recognize sound as God, we shall have nothing but joy all around us. Try to experience the same amount of joy in hearing abusive language as one may derive from a sight of God. We should not mind whether we are abused or praised. This one practice alone may lead to salvation.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If that, too, is not possible, try to meditate on God. Retire to a secluded place and sit erect closing your eyes. Try to perceive God wherever the mind goes and in whatever it sees. Look upon the mind as your best friend and persuade yourself that it will surely help you to attain blessedness. Impress the idea firmly on your mind that it cannot think of anything else than God. If the mind thinks of a watch, or of a pot, recognize it to be nothing else than God. Let the idea of God be tacked on to those images. Be convinced that whatever the mind thinks of, is God, that is precisely what enters your mind. If you find that the mind thinks of nothing, then know God to be precisely that which thinks of nothing. Even if the mind thinks of wife, children or wealth, etc., do not look at those objects as wife, children or wealth, but treat them as God Himself. Treat even a stone or a tree that enters your mind as God. Know God to be just what He appears to you like. This is another straight path to attain blessedness. Each of the methods suggested above is helpful in attaining blessedness. Of course, it is true that one practice may take more time than another. But all of them are equally conducive to spiritual good.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The world seen in a dream vanishes as soon as you wake up and open your eyes. Even so, persuade yourself that you are passing through a state of dream, that whatever is revealed to your senses is nothing but the creation of a dream. As soon as the dream is over, the reality will automatically flash upon you. Believe that all that appears is unreal, made of the stuff of which dreams are made. What meets the eye has no existence in reality. The dream is bound to terminate. As soon as the eyes are opened, it will come to an end. Here it may be asked, how is it that the eyes have not opened till today? Our answer is that you had never so far recognized the world to be a dream. The determination of the soul (Atmā) is unshakable. Therefore, impress it firmly on your mind that the world is a dream. Even if it appears to you as real, continue to believe that it is a dream. Whatever its appearance, do not cease to recognize it as a dream. If you continue to believe like this, the dream will be broken one day and the Truth will be realized by you.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you cannot remember this truth every moment, what is it that you remember most? Is it wife, children, wealth and other beloved things that are uppermost in your thoughts? Try to find out what is it that you love most among these objects. You will perhaps say that Prāṇa (life-breath) is the most beloved of all, there is nothing dearer than life. If so, believe that life (breath) is Brahma (God). You will certainly remember what is dearest to you. Breath is life. Recognize the five types of breath to be Brahma and the sound emanating from these breaths to be the name of Brahma. Keep watch over the ingoing and outgoing breath. Your salvation is assured through this practice alone. The inhalation and exhalation will continue till the very last moment. If this practice is continued till the last moment, you will surely attain salvation in the end. Thus, salvation will be easy to attain even by recognizing life-breath as Brahma and the sound emanating therefrom as the name of Brahma. The outgoing and ingoing breath produces the sound ‘So’ ham,’ which means ‘That (God) I am.’ This is also a name of the Paramātmā. Thus God may be realized even by recognizing breath to be Brahma. The Sādhaka should adopt whatever method appears to him easy and suits his taste.</p>
<p class="Uwach">* * *</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of all effulgences, that possessed by God is the brightest. Nay, God Himself is Supreme Effulgence. Of all effulgent objects open to our view, the Sun possesses the greatest effulgence. Therefore, worship the Sun as an embodiment of Divine Effulgence. If it is urged that the Sun cannot be observed at all times, another alternative is to recognize the sky, which is always visible, as God. Supplement this belief with the idea that the Knower of the soul within the body is a conscious substance and is all-pervading like the sky and possessor of Knowledge. This conception itself <br/>will bring salvation to you. If you cannot hold fast  <br/>this supplementary conception; it does not matter; simply recognize the sky to be God. God Himself will take care of the rest. He will supply the necessary understanding through which you will begin to feel that God is all-pervading like the sky. When God will manifest Himself through it, the sky itself will begin to throb with Life and Consciousness. With this idea meditate on the sky as the unembodied Form of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Besides those described above, there are numerous other ways of attaining blessedness, but something must be done by way of practice. It is futile to think of beatitude without some form of practice, without some exertion. These practices have been pointed out in the Gītā, the Vedas and the Upaniṣads. There is scriptural authority for each of them. Aspirants should adopt any of them according to their individual taste and convenience. Such a practice, if pursued with any selfish motive, will lead to the fulfilment of our selfish ends. It will not lead to God-realization. It will provide the Sādhaka with worldly comforts. If he is so inclined, let the Sādhaka utilize these practices for securing worldly comforts and amenities of life; but if he is anxious to secure true happiness, then let him give up all thought of worldly interests and carefully pursue the practices of image-worship, muttering the Divine name and visualizing joy everywhere. These practices are the best and easiest of all.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">God and His Creation</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">A friend has asked the following question:<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Question.</span> It appears from the Vedas, the Purāṇas and other sacred books of Hinduism and other Indian faiths that the Jīvātmā (individual soul) migrates from one body to another according to his Karma (good or bad actions). If this is a fact, what was the Karma that attached itself to the Atmā (soul) when the world was originally created and the pure, immaculate, actionless soul entered the different bodies moulded by Prakr̥ti (Nature)? If the transmigration of the soul is a natural process, where lies the necessity for Devotion?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Answer.</span> According to the Guṇas (qualities) and the Karmas (actions) the Jīvātmā goes about taking birth in the eighty-four lakhs of species of living beings. These species—consisting of human beings, animals, birds and insects—evolved by Prakr̥ti are manifested at the beginning of creation, and at the end of creation are dissolved into Prakr̥ti, much in the same way as the different varieties of gold ornaments, when dissolved, are reduced into gold again. Prakr̥ti as the prime cause is without beginning. And what is known as the Jīvātmā or individual consciousness has been related with Prakr̥ti from time without beginning. This relation, though coming down from time without beginning, can yet be broken through effort. This breaking of relation is called Mukti (salvation), and it is for the attainment of this salvation that the different paths of Bhakti, Karma and JÛāna (Devotion, Action and Knowledge) have been recommended by the śāstras (scriptures).<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The transmigration of the soul is not so natural as to preclude all possibility of stopping the process. When the transmigration of the soul, it may be argued, is inherent in its character and has gone on forever, it must continue for all time to come; for that which has existed from time without beginning must persist forever. This, however, is not correct; for the transmigration of the soul is due to ignorance, and ignorance or error is a thing which, though existing from time without beginning, disappears the moment true knowledge makes its appearance. This truth is universally applicable. When a man gains knowledge of a new subject, his previous ignorance of the subject disappears; that ignorance, however, was beginningless, that is to say, we cannot assign a fixed point of time when it began. Now when objective ignorance is destroyed by objective knowledge,  where lies the wonder if the beginningless Nescience is destroyed with the dawn of true spiritual Knowledge? On the contrary, there is this particular point in favour of such knowledge, viz., that the Paramātmā Himself being eternal knowledge, which is part of His being, must necessarily be eternal. For the attainment of this knowledge practice of Devotion and other forms of spiritual discipline must be resorted to.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Question.</span> When this universe came into existence for the first time and men, women, birds and trees were shaped into their present moulds, how did this happen? Did the whole thing come into being of its own accord through mutual combination of the elements? If so, the Prakr̥ti, the elements, and the Atmā are still there, and yet no new form comes into being of its own accord through their mutual combination. If it is held that the stainless Paramātmā the embodiment of Knowledge, adopted a gross body and moulded the various forms into their present shapes with His own hands, how is it that the saints have declared the Paramātmā to be formless? Again, it is not possible to create a physical body without the union of the male and the female. And if by any means such a body may be created without such union that imperfect individual will lack the all pervasive quality of the soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Answer</span><span class="char-style-override-12">.</span> A universe created by Prakr̥ti which has a beginning in time cannot be accepted as a postulate. If this is done, that is, if a beginning of the world is posited, it will come to mean that before a particular point of time the universe did not exist; but the fact is not so. On the contrary, it is held that the world as a never-ending process of creation and destruction has existed from time without beginning. If it is held that there must be some point of time, however distant, when this world was created, the pronouncement of the śāstras that the universe has existed from time without beginning will be falsified. Letting alone the view of the śāstras, this point of view cannot be established even by logic. Had there been the one pure spirit in the beginning without any seed of creation, what could be the occasion and ground for this creation to have come into being and in what manner should it have come into being? Of course, it is true that God, who is all-powerful, can do things which are ordinarily impossible. But without any predisposing cause, without the impulse of the Karma of Jīvas, why should He create this universe with so many diversities of position and status? And if we believe that He did so without any rhyme or reason, we thereby expose Him to the charge of partiality and cruelty, neither of which can be attributed to  God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is contended that without the proximity of God, Prakr̥ti alone was responsible for bringing this world into existence, many difficulties will arise. Prakr̥ti, in the first place, is insentient, inert and cannot by herself create anything; secondly, when Prakr̥ti was pure in the beginning, how did she manifest so many diversities at a later stage of her own accord without any ground for the same, unless she already contained the germs of these diversities? If it is held that such is the character of Prakr̥ti, she must have possessed this character from the very beginning, and if she possessed this character from the very beginning, then it is established that the world as we know it, which is nothing but a transformation of Prakr̥ti, has been in existence from time without beginning. Therefore, it is neither proved by the śāstras nor established by reasoning that Prakr̥ti was stainless in the beginning, and that the world came into existence without any predisposing cause either of its own accord or through the will of God. Therefore, it should be understood that the Paramātmā (the Universal Soul), the Jīvātmā (or the individual soul) and Prakr̥ti with the diversities of her creation, and their mutual relations—all these are without beginning. Among these, the world as a creation of Prakr̥ti and Karma are without beginning as a never-ending process of creation and destruction. They do not maintain a uniformity of character. Therefore it is said that they have a beginning and an end, that they are ephemeral, transient and perishable. Prakr̥ti as well as the relation between Prakr̥ti and Jīva are without beginning, but both have an end.  </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the subject is carefully analysed and the conclusions of the śāstras are deeply pondered over, Prakr̥ti also will appear as beginningless, though having an end. According to the conception of Vedānta, she covers only a portion of the Paramātmā. When Knowledge, as understood by Vedānta, is attained, this beginningless Prakr̥ti, too, comes to an end. <br/>Even the Sāṅkhya and Yoga systems of philosophy, which base their conclusions mainly on reasoning and which hold both Prakr̥ti (Matter) and Puruṣa (Spirit) to be beginningless and eternal, recognize the contact between these two principles as beginningless, yet, subject to termination. They hold the absence of contact between the two as synonymous with the absence of sorrow. This is salvation as understood by them. They also hold that in the eye of the blessed Jīva who has attained this state of salvation, Prakr̥ti has come to an end; she exists only for those who do not possess Knowledge.</p>
<p class="Shlok">कृतार्थं प्रति नष्टमप्यनष्टं तदन्यसाधारणत्वात्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yoga-Sµutras II. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to these schools of philosophy Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa are separately cognized because of this contact which is due to ignorance. When the saving knowledge downs, the Atmā is said to have reached the state of Kaivalya (exclusiveness, absoluteness); if all the Jīvas attain salvation, annihilation of Prakr̥ti is possible according to these systems of thought; for in the eyes of the liberated JÛānī, Prakr̥ti is totally annihilated. She persists only in the eyes of the ignorant due to their ignorance. But the view of the ignorant soul has no value. It is the view of the JÛānī that is really true and correct. Therefore, it cannot be proved in any case that Prakr̥ti will retain her existence even after all the Jīvas have attained their salvation. A careful scrutiny of all facts shows that like Nescience, Prakr̥ti and Karma, too; are without beginning, eternal and always existent in the same state of being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika systems recognize the existence of a plurality of substances; but even a superficial examination is enough to negative the existence of these substances. Just as an embankment of sand is washed away by rains, or as objects seen in dream no longer retain their separate existence after awakening, but are all reduced into the seer, similarly a careful examination of facts will negative the existence of diverse objects, and reduce them all into the existence of the one Self. If something other than this Atmā is recognized, you create a room for what you call Swabhāva (Nature) of Prakr̥ti but this Prakr̥ti will last only till the appearance of knowledge. In the case of a dream you cannot prove the existence of anything else than the dreamer. On the awakening of a person from the dream of this world these material elements such as the ether, the air, and so on, are reduced to the same condition to which elements seen in a dream are reduced after one has awakened from the dream. Let us therefore consider what is the foundation of the separate existence of atoms of elements seen in a dream?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We have seen above that the different forms of moulds of matter are without beginning in the sense that their creation and destruction has been going on forever. Now the question remains, ‘How were they moulded originally at the beginning of creation’? Did they come into being of their own accord, or were they created by the Formless Divinity assuming a Form, or moulded into these shapes by the Formless Divinity Itself ? And, lastly if the Formless Divinity assumed a finite form, how could He remain all-pervading?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This question is not so difficult as to require much exercise of thought for a solution. If we calmly consider this question even for a short while, it will present an easy solution. At the beginning of a new creation all these different forms or bodies of Jīvas were brought forth according to their respective Guṇas (characteristics) and Karmas (actions) by the contact of  God, our Father, and Prakr̥ti which is the universal Mother. The Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“My Prakr̥ti or Nature in her primordial, undeveloped state is the womb of all creatures; in that I place the seed (of consciousness). The birth of all beings follows from this combination of Matter and Spirit, O descendant of Bharata. Of all the bodies that take birth from different wombs, this Primordial Matter is the Mother, and I am the procreating Father, O son of Kuntī!”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The question may be asked, when both the substances were formless in the beginning, how did gross physical forms come out of their union? The answer to this is that the phenomenon may be understood from the analogy of water, which is formless when it remains in the rays of the sun but is transformed into vapour through the friction of air, then gradually into cloud and raindrops, and is finally reduced into solid blocks of snow. In the same manner this creation, which lay hidden in Prakr̥ti in the beginning, revealed itself in these solid forms through friction of  Prakr̥ti and God. It will have to be admitted that blocks of snow do not exist in the sky; and had they been there, they could not rest there. That the space is formless is also clear to the naked eye, but clouds are formed in no time in the clear sky. Science and Logic have proved that it is the water existing in the formless atomic state in the rays of the sun which is transformed into cloud and raindrops. Similarly, Formless fire existing in space is occasionally seen in the form of lightning flashes in the clouds, when this fire descends on earth it burns up and destroys all that it touches. When even gross elements like fire and water take form leaving their formless state, what is there to wonder at, if the formless creation should assume form as the result of contact between the formless Divinity and Prakr̥ti?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One thing should also be understood in this connection, viz., that a solid form invariably dissolves itself into the subtle state from which it takes its origin. Lightning appears in the pure, formless sky through the friction of air and dissolves in the same sky. From friction in fire, water takes its origin and is formed into solid ice through the effect of cold. That very water when heated by fire, is reduced into vapour and finally disappears in the formless sky. In the same manner, the physical forms of the various Jīvas originate at the beginning of creation from Prakr̥ti, according to their respective Guṇas and Karmas, and in the end dissolve in the self-same Prakr̥ti. This cycle of creation and destruction is without beginning.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Prakr̥ti is sometimes active, and sometimes inactive. Such is her character. When the three Guṇas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, are in a state of equilibrium, this Prakr̥ti which is nothing but a combination of the three Guṇas, is inactive, and when this equilibrium of the three Guṇas is disturbed, she becomes active. It is the active Prakr̥ti which through contact with ºśwara  (God) brings forth the gross forms of Jīvas lying dormant in her womb. The Lord says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, with me as the supervisor, Nature brings forth the whole creation both animate and inanimate: it is due to this cause that the wheel of Saṁsāra is revolving.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">हेतुनानेन कौन्तेय जगद्विपरिवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The analogy of fire is very helpful in understanding how God, though formless, assumes a form, and yet remains all-pervading. Fire in the formless state is present everywhere; it is that very fire which is lodged within us to help us digest our food. Without fire food cannot be digested, and if it becomes manifest, it will reduce the body to ashes. This shows that within us fire stays in an unmanifest state. This all-pervading,  formless, unmanifest fire assumes a form when kindled by means of fuel or friction. Even when unmanifest, fire is present in such objects as wood, etc. Were it not present there, how would it appear through friction? That very fire when extinguished goes back into the formless state. When fire becomes manifest at a  particular place in the form of a flame, none can say because it is manifest here, it has ceased to exist in all other places. It is an undoubted fact that though manifest at one place, or even simultaneously at many places, the all-pervasiveness of the formless fire remains undisturbed. Similarly, the Paramātmā, even when manifest at a particular place or at various places simultaneously through contact with Māyā, is present at the same time at all other places in his unmanifest form. Nothing can interfere with his all-pervasiveness or wholeness. The illustration of fire has been taken simply to give the reader a rough idea of the subject. As a matter of fact there can be no comparison between the all-pervasiveness of the Paramātmā and the pervasiveness of fire.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Question:</span> What was the object of God in creating Prakr̥ti and the world?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-12">Answer:</span> Prakr̥ti was not created by God. Prakr̥ti means Nature, and Nature is something which naturally exists for all time. There is no doubt that the world with its moving and unmoving objects was created by God. The unmotived Grace of the all-pervasive, all-just and all-merciful Paramātmā, should be understood to be the only motive for His creating this universe. He reveals the forms of moving creatures according to their Guṇas and Karmas in the previous cycle of creation. Being a just ruler without any self-interest and attachment, God is held to be a non-doer, even though creating the forms of the Jīvas according to their respective Guṇas and Karmas. His dispensations are always full of mercy though following a prescribed code and are intended to remove the suffering of the Jīvas. Occasionally He goes to the length of bringing His Prakr̥ti under control and manifesting Himself in a Form in His attempt to confer the highest spiritual good on the Jīvas. It is the duty of all Jīvas to worship the Paramātmā, who is their dearest friend, and whose mercy is so motiveless and disinterested.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The world consists of only two principles—matter and life. Puruṣa represents life and Prakr̥ti represents matter. Puruṣa is the seer and Prakr̥ti the object of sight. Puruṣa is immutable. Both these principles are patent to everyone. The existence of both these must be recognized in everyone of us. Of these two, that which sees, is the seer and the other which is visible in the shape of creation, is the object of sight.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All Individual souls or Jīvas are fragments of the Paramātmā. A spark of fire is not different from fire, the two are identical in essence; even so the Jīva too is not different from the Paramātmā. This visible universe being an evolute of Prakr̥ti, is nothing but the Prakr̥ti. It is only a modification of Prakr̥ti—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कार्यकरणकर्तृत्वे हेतु: प्रकृतिरुच्यते।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above line from the Gītā declares Prakr̥ti to be responsible for bringing into existence the effect (creation) and the instruments (senses). The five elements such as ether, etc., and their five attributes, viz., sound etc., constitute the effect. The five organs of perception, the five organs of action plus the mind, the faculty of discrimination and ego—these thirteen constitute the instruments. Prakr̥ti is the source of these all. Thus being an evolute of Prakr̥ti the whole of this objective world is nothing but Prakr̥ti itself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, let us try to understand the relation between Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa. Prakr̥ti is not a part of Puruṣa. She is His śakti (Energy). śakti (Energy) is not different from the śaktimān. At the time of the final dissolution of creation the whole of this objective world gets dissolved into Prakr̥ti. Then Prakr̥ti alone remains and the objective world disappears. The Vedānta believes Prakr̥ti to be indefinable and the Sāṁkhya system conceives her to be beginningless and eternal. The Yoga system also declares Prakr̥ti to be beginningless and eternal. When active she manifests herself in the form of this objective world, and when she is inactive she remains in her unmanifest state. The process of evolution in the objective world is as follows:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From Prakr̥ti in her original state evolves the Mahattattva which is also known as the principle of Cosmic Intelligence. From Cosmic Intelligence springs up the Cosmic Ego and from the Cosmic Ego arises the Cosmic Mind. From the  same ego evolves space or ether, from ether air, from air  fire, from fire water and from water the earth. Some of the great ¤Rṣis have declared these to be the cause of subtle Tanmātrās as well as of the senses. Some have traced the origin of these Tanmātrās to the Ego and the others to the Mahattattva  it self. They, however, mean one and the same thing. The Cosmic Intelligence, the Cosmic Ego and the Cosmic Mind are three different aspects or phases of the same principle, viz., the Mind (<span class="char-style-override-7">अन्त:करण</span>). From the subtle elements or the Tanmātrās evolve the five senses of perception, the five organs of action and the five objects of the senses of perception. The totality of these constitutes the objective world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the above exposition it is clear beyond doubt that Prakr̥ti is the root cause of this objective world. Speech cannot describe her in her original state, because speech itself is only an evolute <span class="char-style-override-7">(कार्य)</span> of Prakr̥ti. Hence Prakr̥ti is regarded as indefinable. Mind and intellect too are effects of Prakr̥ti and are, therefore, incapable of knowing her. Hence she is called incomprehensible and uninvestigable. Thus even though Prakr̥ti is beyond the ken of speech, mind and intellect, yet her existence is proved beyond doubt by her effect, namely, the objective world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa both are omnipresent. The cause always pervades its effect. From the analogy of water pervading ice the all-pervasiveness of Prakr̥ti can be easily understood; but the Puruṣa being very subtle, His pervasiveness is not so easily and so clearly comprehensible, yet His pervasiveness is even greater than that of Prakr̥ti. Prakr̥ti is only the cause, but Puruṣa—God is the greater Cause. It is He who holds the entire creation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This greater Cause, God, pervades the whole of Prakr̥ti and her effects. It has been stated before that the cause always pervades its effect. From ether evolves air, therefore air is pervaded by ether. From air evolves fire therefore fire is pervaded by air and ether both. From fire evolves water, from water earth, therefore the earth is pervaded by all the other four elements, viz., ether, air, fire and water. Even so Prakr̥ti which is the cause of all these elements pervades them all. This Prakr̥ti however is only an Energy (<span class="char-style-override-7">शक्ति</span>) of Puruṣa, the śaktimān. Therefore, the great Cause of all, the Puruṣa or the principle of Consciousness, pervades both inert matter (Prakr̥ti) and the evolute of that matter, viz., this objective world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, let us try to understand whether God, Consciousness or Puruṣa is the material cause or the efficient cause of this creation. Truly speaking, He is both the material and the efficient cause. The Lord says in the Gītā:— <span class="char-style-override-7">‘चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागश:’,</span> that is, ‘The four orders of society (viz., the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya, the Vaiśya and the śµudra) were created by Me classifying them according to their prenatal qualities and apportioning corresponding duties to them.’ Here the Lord declares Himself to be the efficient cause. But, <span class="char-style-override-7">‘मयाध्यक्षेण प्रकृति: सूयते सचराचरम्;’</span> ‘Arjuna, with Me as the supervisor, Nature brings forth the whole creation, both the movable and the immovable’—here He declares Prakr̥ti to be the efficient cause. How can there be two instrumental causes? The answer to this is that when Prakr̥ti carries on the process of creation with the Conscious Puruṣa as her Lord and Master, and under His supervision, then the virtual creator is the Paramātmā Himself. Prakr̥ti is only His agent. Thus really speaking God alone is the efficient cause of the creation. And almost all are unanimous in recognizing God, the principle of Consciousness, to be the efficient cause. As regards His being the material cause there is some difference of opinion. But careful investigation will prove that God is also the material cause of creation according to the viewpoints of JÛāna and Bhakti both. According to the viewpoint of JÛāna (Knowledge) the matter may be understood on the analogy of the dreamer who through imagination transforms himself into a dream-world of his own of which he himself becomes the observer. Now there is no material cause of the dream-world here other than the conscious dreamer himself. Even so when Prakr̥ti is perceived with her modes or attributes, there, truly speaking, nothing exists besides the Paramātmā. Prakr̥ti with all her evolutes is superimposed on the Paramātmā. And according to the viewpoint of Devotion, Prakr̥ti should be recognized as the śakti or Energy of the Paramātmā, and śakti or Energy is never different from the śaktimān. The whole of this objective world is only an extension of Prakr̥ti, hence it is nothing but the Paramātmā. Therefore, the Paramātmā is its material cause. This view of God being both the material and efficient cause of creation is clearly supported by statements in the Gītā, such as “Vāsudeva is all”,<span class="char-style-override-10">1</span> “All this is permeated by Me”,<span class="char-style-override-10">2</span> “There is nothing else beside Me”,<span class="char-style-override-10">3</span> “He from whom is the emanation of all beings, by whom all this is pervaded”,<span class="char-style-override-10">4</span> “I am the source of all creation; everything in the world moves because of Me;”<span class="char-style-override-10">5</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> </span>etc.</p>
<p class="Footnotes">1. ‘वासुदेव: सर्वमिति’</p>

<p class="Footnotes">5. ‘अहं सर्वस्य प्रभवो मत्त: सर्वं प्रवर्तते।’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here it may be argued that if God is the author, the quality of authorship of agency can certainly be attributed to Him. Our answer to this is that God in reality is not a doer. He is a non-doer—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्धयकर्तारमव्ययम्’. </span>The Lord says, “Though the author of this creation, know Me, the immortal Lord, to be a non-doer.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Atmā is only a synonym of Puruṣa. According to the Sāṁkhya system Puruṣas are many. The philosophy of Yoga also supports the view of many Puruṣas, but it also recognizes the existence of a supreme Puruṣa or ºśwara. Of these, while the Jīvas are many, the supreme Puruṣa or ºśwara is one. The Pµurva Mīmāṁsā also believes in a plurality of Puruṣas. The Vaiśeṣika and Nyāya systems recognize two types of Puruṣas, the Jīvātmā (individual) and the Paramātmā (Oversoul). The Vedānta recognizes only one Puruṣa, and not many. All these systems (in whatever form it may be) have recognized the Atmā or Puruṣa, to be a conscious substance. Now these views about the Atmā being one or many are all true according to the various standpoints. For the goal of all philosophical systems is the welfare of the Atmā, and the teachings of all being conducive to welfare of the Atmā they are all correct. An individual can attain salvation through right knowledge of the Atmā by following any course of discipline, no matter whether he believes the Atmā to be one or many. Subsequent to the attainment of salvation none can truly describe what the Atmā is like, because that state is something indescribable. The fact is, he alone who has realized the Atmā knows what it is like. So long as the Paramātmā is not realized it will be easy and better for people to guide their conduct according to the following lines of thought.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With regard to the Puruṣa it has to be remembered that there are two varieties of Puruṣas—the Jīvātmā (individual soul) and the Paramātmā (God). Jīvātmās are many and Paramātmā is one. The Paramātmā, again though one, has been recognized to have two aspects—Saguṇa (with attribute) and Nirguṇa (absolute). That aspect of Paramātmā which is united with Prakr̥ti, the originator of the three Guṇas or modes viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, is known as the Saguṇa aspect. And that which is devoid of Guṇas is the Nirguṇa, or the absolute aspect. It should, however, be remembered that the Saguṇa and Nirguṇa are only two aspects of one and the same Paramātmā who does not admit of duality. Paramātmā is the totality or aggregate of both these aspects. The conception may be illustrated by the analogy of ether or space. Which when it holds in a portion of it, air, fire, water and earth may be termed space with four material elements and the rest of it, which does not contain those elements, is pure or absolute space. The Lord made use of this illustration in the Gītā mentioning only air in place of the four elements.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Just as the extensive and all-pervading air (which is born of ether) always remains in ether, likewise know that all beings (sprung as they are from My thought) abide in Me.” <span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* यथाकाशस्थितो नित्यं वायु: सर्वत्रगो महान्।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">तथा सर्वाणि भूतानि मत्स्थानीत्युपधारय॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right para-style-override-6">(Gita IX. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Space is at once the support and cause of air, etc., and also pervades them all. In the same manner the Paramātmā is the support and cause of the entire creation and also pervades it. Let us consider the point a little more closely. Take for instance the case of the cloud hanging in space; it originates in space, exists in space and finally gets dissolved into space. Similarly air, fire, water and earth also take their origin from space, exist in space and ultimately get dissolved into space one after another. Akāśa being their source and origin is the cause of their manifestation. And they stand as effect in relation to Akāśa. The effect is pervaded, and the cause is pervasive. Akāśa, therefore, pervades these elements and they rest in Akāśa, which there is for their support or foundation. Prakr̥ti being the source and origin of all the elements including space is their cause and pervades the whole of this objective world. And all these rest on the foundation of Prakr̥ti. Prakr̥ti on her part is the energy or śakti of the Paramātmā; therefore, being the basis or foundation of Prakr̥ti herself, the Paramātmā is the Great Cause of the entire creation as also of Prakr̥ti. It is the Paramātmā who pervades them all, and it is the Paramātmā, again, who is their sole foundation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That aspect of God which embraces this creation is the Saguṇa aspect; beyond this, where there is no creation, where He is absolute, that is the state of transcendence, the state beyond the Guṇas. The Saguṇa aspect, again, may be further divided into two varieties (1) that with form, and (2) that having no form or formless. Just as the earth is both with form and formless—with form in the rose, as formless in its smell, just as fire in its latent state is formless and with form when manifest, or just as water in its pure atomic <br/>state in the sky is formless, and is with form when condensed into the shape of a cloud, rain and hail, even so the all-pervasive Saguṇa aspect of the Paramātmā although <br/>continuing in its formless state, manifests itself in this world with attributes even in an embodied form. Just as the unmanifest and manifest aspects of fire, water and earth, although representing two distinct states, are essentially one, there being no difference between them even so there is no difference between the absolute Formless state, the Formless state with Guṇas and the Embodied Form with Guṇas of the Paramātmā. They together form the entirety of the Paramātmā. This has been made clear by the Lord in the following line of the Gītā:— <span class="char-style-override-7">‘साधिभूताधिदैवं मां साधियज्ञं च ये विदु:’ </span>This is the integral Brahma of the Gītā. This is Puruṣottama—the supreme Puruṣa. It is this entirety of the Lord which should be worshipped. If a worshipper ignores the Saguṇa aspect and worships only the Nirguṇa, or absolute aspect, he worships the same God. Even so he who worships the Embodied form or even the Formless Qualified aspect, worships the self-same God. All such worshippers finally attain the same Paramātmā. But the best worshipper is certainly he who worships the Entire Brahma, knowing well and respecting all His aspects. He realizes the Paramātmā easily and speedily. If it is asked, what then is the difference between the individual soul (Jīvātmā) and the Paramātmā? Our answer is that Jīvātmā is the worshipper, and Paramātmā is the object of worship. The Paramātmā is eternally and entirely free from faults like partiality and prejudice; results of actions such as merit and sin do not accrue to Him and He is not subject of joy and sorrow; while the Jīva, being ignorant, is subject to these emotions, is swayed by likes and dislikes, and his actions also are productive of merit and sin. Of course, the Jīva can be rid of all these on attaining knowledge of God’s reality through His grace. <br/>His ignorance is responsible for all these and they disappear as soon as the reality about God is known. One can attain this knowledge by treading the path of Karmayoga, Bhaktiyoga or JÛānayoga.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now if it is asked whether subsequent to the realization of the Paramātmā difference with Him still persists, or whether identity is establised with Him, our answer is that the Paramātmā appears to the worshipper, identical or otherwise, according as he conceives Him to be. Here it may be argued that so long as the Paramātmā appears to him as identical or otherwise, it is evident that it is the conception of the worshipper which makes Him appear as such and that he has not yet realized Him, whereas the question related to the state which stood above the states of identity and difference, nay, which was the consummation of the two was designated as the realization of the Highest Truth of or attainment of the Paramātmā, the state which the Vedas describe as indescribable. Our answer to this is that none else can describe the state which the Vedas have described as indescribable. Therefore, it should be understood that this state is indescribable. Again, it may be asked; when that state is indescribable, what is the proof of its existence? In answer to this it may be said that it does not require any proof. It is self-evident. That most important fact concerning it, is that it is this state which established all proofs and the existence of all objects. The Vedas and other scriptures (śāstras) as well as the revelations of saints, all declare it to be an open fact. It is the realization of this state that the Vedas principally aim at. Such is that indescribable thing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is this state which is known as the Puruṣa, and His śakti or Energy is Prakr̥ti. The three Guṇas are products of that Prakr̥ti, hence we may also declare her as consisting of the three Guṇas. The Vedānta and the Sāṅkhya systems of philosophy conceive Prakr̥ti to be the state of equilibrium of the three Guṇas and the three Guṇas to be her very essence. But the Lord has described the Guṇas as products of Prakr̥ti in the Gītā. For instance, He says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">‘The Guṇas born of Prakr̥ti.’</span><span class="char-style-override-13">1</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> </span><span class="char-style-override-12">(III. 5)</span> </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The Vedānta treats Prakr̥ti as without beginning, but having an end. The Sāṅkhya, and the Yoga systems treat her as without beginning and eternal. In the Gītā the Lord has described her as without beginning, but not eternal. He has declared as eternal only the one beginningless unmanifest Consciousness (VIII. 20). Nor has the Lord described Prakr̥ti as having an end, or transient. Therefore, she should be treated as indefinable. The Lord did not describe her as eternal, firstly because it is only the beginningless absolute and unmanifest Paramātmā who is eternal. Secondly, if she is regarded as eternal, then discipline of knowledge will have no standing. Similarly, He did not describe her as transient, firstly, because she persists even after the final dissolution, when all the objective world gets dissolved into Prakr̥ti and through her proximity to Paramātmā at the beginning of Great creation <span class="char-style-override-7">(महासर्ग)</span> the objective world again manifests itself, from which she appears as though eternal. Moreover, had the Lord described her as without beginning but having an end (or transient), the glory of the path of Devotion would have disappeared. This shows that both the paths (of Knowledge and Devotion) are approved by the Lord, and it was, therefore, that He described Prakr̥ti neither as eternal, nor as transient.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This proves that Prakr̥ti is indefinable. Even the Yoga and Sāṅkhya systems maintain that after the attainment of knowledge of Paramātmā, the Jīvātmā gets disjoined with Prakr̥ti once for all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All philosophical systems maintain that on the realization of self, the state of ‘Absolution’ <span class="char-style-override-7">(कैवल्य)</span> is attained. The soul then ceases to have any connection with Prakr̥ti and her evolutes. According to the Vedānta, nothing exists besides Brahma, which is consolidated Knowledge and Bliss. The Sāṅkhya, and Yoga systems maintain that Prakr̥ti continues to exist even after the realization of self, but he who has realized the  Self ceases to have anything to do with her. All these virtually mean the same thing. No system declares that the connection of Puruṣa with Prakr̥ti persists even after the realization of Self, and when the connection ceases there can be no objection even if she remains, nor can there be any harm if she ceases to exist. A person awakened from a dream does not maintain any relation with his dream-world; in that case why should he object if the creations of his dream continue to exist somewhere?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From the above exposition it is clear that so long as the objective world is perceived and we maintain some relation with it, duality of Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa will persist in the shape of life and matter, seer and the object of sight, or knower and the object of knowledge, and the whole creation is only an amplification of these two.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">Love—the Only Means of Realizing God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Man possesses an inherent aversion for pain and attraction for pleasure. No one in this world courts suffering, or is averse to happiness. He, however, mistakes things that are full of pain to be so many founts of joy and falls an easy prey to their temptation. A fowler strews corn to entrap birds. And the foolish birds not realizing that they are the means of ensnaring them are misled to regard them as a source of pleasure. A flame appears attractive and pleasant to the moth which rushes into it and is reduced to ashes.  Even so the wide net spread by Prakr̥ti appears pleasant to us and we get entangled in it. Just as a wise bird finding other birds caught in a trap overcomes its temptation for corn and does not fall into the trap, even so men of wisdom do not fall a prey to the allurements of the senses. The ignorant, however, easily yield to their temptations and suffer consequently time and again. Ferocious beasts such as the lion and the tiger are not so harmful and oppressive as is the attachment for wife and children, wealth and honour, and above all, the body. It is through ignorance that all these appear so attractive, whereas in consequence they are all attended with sorrow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None of these things is lasting. That which is not lasting becomes in the end, at the time of its disappearance, a cause of suffering and sorrow. There is no pleasure even in their enjoyment. A dainty dish appears tasteful only in the beginning; take more of it and you will feel satiated. Similarly, other objects of pleasure, such as the embrace of a woman, will cause disgust to you at a certain stage. There is no joy even in wealth. Suppose a certain individual becomes master of lakhs of rupees, hebuilds houses, purchases cars and makes the best of a life of ease and enjoyment. Then through an adverse turn of fortune he loses his wealth. All the objects of enjoyment forsake him one by one. Now the very memory of his lost fortune causes him intense pain. His heart begins to burn in jealousy when he sees other men of affluence moving about and enjoying their lives. Similarly, seminal weakness and other complaints occasioned by excessive enjoyment to women become a source of terrible suffering. He contemplates in his mind that he will never indulge in that habit again if he recovers from that disease; but as soon as he is well again, his love of enjoyment gets the better of his reason and he takes to the same course once again. The enjoyments of the other world, too, are likewise rooted in sorrow. The earning of wealth, its protection, application to some use, its exit through various channels, and above all its loss—all these are sources of suffering. One has also very often to have recourse to unfair dealings in earning wealth. His better sense deters him from this course, but the impulse of greed goads him to take to that course only once and not to do it again. He finds himself placed on the horns of a dilemma. His heart becomes a battle-ground between two opposing impulses. The pure (Sāttvika) and gross (Tāmasika) impulses offer battle to each other, and he finds himself in a miserable condition. Ultimately, just as a cat overpowers the mouse, the forces of Tāmasa gain complete mastery over him. There are very few people who can resist them. One has to take great pains in preserving the wealth he has accumulated. He finds himself unable to make a gift of it to anybody, and while he is thus busy in protecting it, Death approaches him. He then begins to repent for his folly and says to himself, ‘Oh, what have I done? In vain have I amassed all this wealth, now that I am forced to leave it all.’ Thus, full of grief and remorse he departs from this world. The long and short of it is that the enjoyments of the world are like poison sweetened with honey. They are invested with a false glamour, and the pleasure that we find in them exists only in our imagination, and is not real. It is like a mirage, it has no trace of joy about it. Is it not then sheer folly to run after this pleasure? True happiness lies in the Divine only. He is the embodiment of supreme Bliss—this is what the saints, the sages and the scriptures say. The joy of sovereignty over the three regions is insignificant compared to this bliss. The Gītā says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“And having obtained which he does not reckon any other gain as greater than that and established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow” (VI. 22).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the attainment of this state of Bliss one will not lose his serenity even if his body is hacked to pieces. There will be no diminution in his joy even if he loses his worldly possessions. Realizing the Paramātmā he becomes one with Him, the embodiment of Bliss itself. He no longer feels any want. The Gītā says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वत: सम्प्लुतोदके।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 46)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as in a place flooded with water on all sides there is no necessity for a well, similarly on the attainment of the bliss of identity with Brahma one no longer requires anything else. This incomparable bliss is attainable only through Love. Shift this love from worldly objects, such as wife and children, wealth and honour and so on, which are attended with sorrow and are detrimental to our spiritual well-being, let us direct it towards that all-blissful Divine so as to be able to attain that unbroken and immutable supreme Bliss. The above discussion will go to prove that the true welfare of humanity lies in cultivating dispassion towards the world, and Love for the Paramātmā.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">What is True Love<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This Love is, in fact, indefinable; it cannot be properly described. We can make only some guesses about its nature. One who possesses this Love need not be asked to cultivate it. A greedy man does not require to be told that he should cultivate love for money. The very name of the philosopher’s stone is dear to him, even though none of his ancestors may have known what this stone is like. His face brightens up as soon as he hears about it. Even so, where there is Love of God, the mention of His very Name sends a thrill into the heart of the lover. Talk of God is as dear to the heart of a lover of God as the talk of wealth is dear to the greedy, or the talk of lovely women is dear to a lover of women. Just as the very mention of the name of a dear friend arrests our attention and the talk about him sounds agreeable to our ears, even so the story of God’s greatness and glory is pleasing to the ears of a lover of God. There is a world of difference between Love and worldly attachment (<span class="char-style-override-7">मोह</span>). Love is free from all tinge of passion; while worldly attachment is tainted with desire. There is an element of selfishness in worldly attachment and such attachment is liable to disappear; but Love is selfless and constant. The fondness of the child for its mother is not love but infatuation, inasmuch as it seeks to remain in close proximity to the mother, but does not find itself disposed to obey the commands of the mother. No such thing will happen where there is Love. A lover is always anxious to make his beloved happy, and to do some good offices to him. Such lovers, however, are rarely to be found. Such a disposition is generally found only in the Lord and His devotees. In śrī Rāmacaritamānasa the following words are found addressed to śrī Rāma:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O slayer of demons, Thyself and Thy devotees alone are the true and selfless benefactors of the world.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaṅkara says, “O Umā, none of these—the preceptor, the parents and the relatives—can equal Rāma as a benefactor.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Gods, human beings and demigods—all these have this character in common, viz., that their love has a selfish motive behind it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Describing the characteristics of true friendship śrī Rāma says to Sugrīva:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who does not share the woes of his friend, his very sight is productive of evil.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A true friend will regard his own sorrow, heavy as the mountain, as no more heavy than a particle of dust; whereas his friend’s sorrow though light as straw will weigh on him heavy as the Meru (mountain).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One with whom the above attitude is not natural, why should that depraved soul extend his hand to establish friendship?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A true friend will deter his friend from following evil ways and guide him along the right path. He will bring out before the public only the strong points of his friend’s character, and suppress his weak points.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He will feel no hitch in giving to and taking from his friend and will always try to serve his best interests to the best of his strength and ability.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In his friend’s adversity he will show him more attention than ever before. Such are the qualifications of a virtuous friend, says the śruti.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O friend, depending on my strength, give up all sorrow. I shall do your work in everyway possible.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord literally carried out all that He had said. Bearing Himself the pang of separation from śrī Sītā, He relieved at first the terrible suffering of Sugrīva.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pure, unalloyed Love is found only among saintly men. Lust and infatuation reign supreme in the world. It appears to a person that his wife and brother are very fond of him; but their love, too, is of the nature of infatuation. Had this not been the case, they would have behaved according as it pleased him; they would have moulded their faith and conduct according to his pleasure.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If, for instance, he wore khaddar, and had a liking of khaddar, his son, brother and wife, too, would have taken to khaddar. But this is rarely found. The reason is that the element of love in their attachment is very meagre; lust and infatuation are predominant in it. That is why their conduct is guided by their own sweet will. A wife of this type loves her husband for her own happiness, and not for the happiness of the husband. This is not Love. Even such attachment when conceived towards God, is good, but Love is a different thing altogether. When this attachment is accompanied by pure motive, there is nothing like it. Such a pure love can be easily attained by spiritual aspirants, a lesser amount of labour is involved in its cultivation than in pursuing the love of gold. For in the latter case, it is we who love gold, and get no response from the other side, i.e., gold, which is a material substance. God, however, is not insentient. He is a supreme Lover Himself. His love for us is more intense than what we may ourselves bear towards Him. That is why this love bears fruit more quickly. In the same manner, great souls (Mahātmās) too love us only for our good. If we offer but once our Love towards them, they will return it four times. They do not have any selfish motive in returning that love. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even motherly love is tainted by infatuation, and some amount of selfish desire. She expects her son to perform her obsequies and offer annual oblations to her after her death and to serve her in her old age. In some cases the love of a mother is marked by pure infatuation and has no tinge of self-interest in it. Take, for instance, the case of an old woman, who is excessively fond of her grandson. She expects nothing from the child in return, because she knows she will die before the child attains maturity. Similarly suppose a mother has got a son of disreputable conduct, evil-minded and born only to heap troubles on his parents and other members of the family. He commits a theft and is sent to jail. The mother weeps for him. She does not expect to derive any happiness from him; still she tries her utmost to bring him out of jail because she is fondly attached to him. Love is something altogether different from this. The greatest good of an individual lies in developing disinterested and exclusive Love for the Paramātmā. Love, which though disinterested is yet meagre, cannot bring God-realization soon. Through pure and exclusive love alone one can purchase this priceless commodity. The love that is directed towards objects of enjoyment such as wife and children, or towards enjoyments in the celestial region, is no love of God, it is love for these objects of enjoyments. Although it is good to have love for salvation, the highest type of love is that which is cultivated for its own sake (without any sense of return); that is called Pure Love. The love between a spiritual teacher and those who assemble to hear his discourses, too, cannot be called altogether free from self-interest; for had it been so, why should the teacher desire that more people should attend his discourses and that all should be present at the right time. This shows that there is some interest involved. That interest is, no doubt, of an exalted type. Even those who attend his discourses have various interests to serve. Some have wealth for their object, others come with the hope that it will intensify their meditation and Bhajana; there are still others who seek honour, while others come under the belief that there attending the discourses will do them some good in whatever sense it may be. These are the various interests that guide those who attend his discourse. If the teacher says something against the will of the hearers, they refuse to hear it, or ignore it altogether. If the teacher for some reason or other begins to put forward his own interest, his hearers may tolerate him for some time, but at last they will feel disgusted. Even in the efforts for the propagation of devotion, if people detect some selfish motive of the preacher, they immediately forsake him. There is hardly anyone who may pass the test of a saint taken without previous notice. Those, who are put to the test will take him to be either a lunatic or a selfish man, and may ultimately forsake him. Here is an illustration:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There were two spiritual strivers in a village, who used to beg for their daily food in the village and bringing the same under a tree outside the village they used to partake of it once during the day, and for the rest of the day and night they used to keep themselves absorbed in their spiritual exercises. Their pure life and their devotion to Bhajana arrested the attention of the villagers who began to pay frequent visits to them. Their fame spread throughout the village. The report even reached the ears of the ruler of that territory who made up his mind to pay his respects for them. People came and informed them that the king would come for their Darśana that day. They took it to be a great calamity. They thought an aspirant would fall from his ideal in no time if he received honour and applause frequently, and began to relish them. Bearing this truth in mind, the two aspirants when they saw the king’s party coming at a distance started a false quarrel among themselves over the division of their day’s food. The king’s party arrived when they were in the thick of the quarrel. Finding them quarrelling like that over loaves, the king thought the saints were hardly worth anything. He, therefore, returned disappointed to his palace. When love and respect are scared away even at the sight of a false show of self-interest, it is well-nigh impossible for true love to exist where genuine self-interest prevails. Therefore, our Love towards God should be purely disinterested. There is nothing in this world which is equal in worth to genuine, exclusive and pure love; God is realized only through that Love; that is the price one has to pay for God-realization. Once this Love is awakened, everything except the Lord, becomes insipid. We worship God, and yet He does not accept our worship. How is this to be accounted for? The reason is, Love is wanting in us. He is bound to accept our worship provided there is love in it. The Lord proclaimed it in the Gītā with His own sacred lips:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whosoever offers to Me with love a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water, I appear in person before that disinterested devotee of purified intellect, and delightfully partake of that article offered by him with love” (IX. 26).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God does not hunger for our offering of fruit, flower or leaf. He hungers only for our Love. He is always on the look out for a true lover in this world. A true lover is he who while allowing himself to be flayed alive for the sake of God, will feel a stream of joy flowing through every pore of his body. If God accepts the things he calls his own, his pleasure knows no bounds. He feels and rightly so, that through that acceptance he has been cured of his egoistic sense; for so long as one feels a certain thing to be his own, it will not be accepted even by a noble soul, to say nothing of God. And the moment our offering is accepted by  God, it may be taken for granted that our sense of egoism has disappeared. As a matter of fact everything on earth belongs to God, it is through error that we imagine it belongs to us. It is the idea of possession that has to be radically removed. The day God accepts us with all our possessions, we may take it for granted that from that day He has become our own!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When pure Love for God is developed, one no longer entertains fear of, or love for anything else in the world, nor does he care any more for dishonour or infamy. Just as a strong flood uproots and carries away all trees on the banks of the Ganges, even so all ideas of honour and dishonour are washed away by the strong current of Love. Just as the mental current of a Yogī established in meditation flows only towards God, even so the current of Love begins to flow towards God. The joy felt in this state is truly indescribable. One is purged of all evils such as the sense of shame, fear and honour born of the ego, the different pairs of opposites  case to have any effect on him and the lover becomes as dead to the world as a corpse. The Lord is always subservient to the will of such a lover. The Lord offers His all to a devotee who offers all that he possesses, to Him. When Love grows in intensity it expresses itself through horripilation. Just as the ocean heaves and swells when it observes the full moon in the sky, even so the heart of a lover begins to dance out of joy when he beholds with his own eyes the soul-captivating beauty of the lotus-like face of the all-beautiful Lord. The ocean of Love within his heart swells and overflows, the heart can no longer contain it; his voice gets choked, words come falteringly from his lips, Love begins to flow like a stream through his eyes and nose and in the end reaching the subtle nerves under the eye-brows and the skull makes the Lover totally unconscious. His condition is then reduced to that of a lifeless statue.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the devotee begins to pine for the Lord, the Lord, too, begins to pine for the devotee. If Sītā wept and lamented for Rāma when she was taken away by Rāvaṇa and kept confined in the Aśoka garden, Rāma also wept and lamented for Sītā when He searched her from forest to forest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we pine for the Lord as intensely as Rukmiṇī and Draupadī did, the Lord is sure to pine for us, and will certainly reveal Himself before us, God is not pleased by the mere mechanical observance of the rules of worship; He is a seeker of Love! Love is not governed by rules. Where the conduct is regulated by rules, Love is not of a high order. In Love stringency of rules and regulations is naturally absent. No conscious effort has to be made to break them. They fall off by themselves. It is in this state that true Love makes itself manifest. There is no outward show in this Love. The devotee becoming an embodiment of Love gets absorbed and merged in the Lord. This is Love in its purest state, which is the true form of God. The Gopīs of blessed memory possessed this highest state of Love. The mere sight of their Love dissolved and melted even inanimate objects, to say nothing of human beings! The very atmosphere of the place where this Love manifests itself helps to diffuse the intoxication of Love. The whole environment of the place where the Lover moves gets infected by Love. The place touched by the Lover, and even the dust touched by his feet gets transformed into Love. Only true lovers of God know the secret of this truth, and such Love can develop only in relation to God and not in relation to any other object. The story of Love which carried śrī Uddhava off his feet, will similarly transport us into the region of Love, if we can but hear it. But where shall we get the privilege of hearing it? Such a thing cannot happen where there is a mere show of Love. It can happen only where there is genuine Love, and not a mere semblance of it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a person whose heart is pierced by the amorous glances of a beautiful woman sees the whole world as pervaded only by her existence and moves in the world as a lunatic enjoying untold bliss in thoughts of her, although the object of his love is a mortal being, we cannot imagine the condition of that blessed being who has been pierced by the dart-like glances of the Divine śyāmasundara, who is God-incarnate and the embodiment of Supreme Bliss. No one can imagine what will be the nature of ecstatic joy that he will feel intoxicated with, and what will he perceive in this world. Nor is there anything within our experience in this world which can be compared to this state. If the enjoyments of the world are likened to a particle of dust and the bliss of God perception is compared to the earth itself, if the former are likened to the image of the sun reflected in a mirror and the latter to the sun itself, even then the comparison would appear incongruous. Just as a figure made of ice cannot sound the depth of the ocean and describe it, similarly we cannot even guess the nature of this joy. In fact, like the figure of ice which gets dissolved in the ocean, the Lover of God is transformed into God Himself. He cannot be expected to give us even a rough idea of what God is like; for he no longer remains apart from God, while others cannot describe His true nature.  The Lover no doubt appears to us as moving in the same body even after he has realized God, but as a matter of fact his body is then transformed into Love itself. He showers Love wherever he goes. Even an ordinary glance from him will drench people with the nectar of Love. When even such persons are rarely to be found, how much more difficult should it be to obtain a sight of God? But if there is Love, it becomes easy enough. God is all-merciful. Were He to judge us only by our actions, our redemption would have been a difficult job; but He judges us not by our actions. He gives Himself up to us in return for Love. He who comes to know this secret surrenders himself to God and thereby succeeds realizing Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">When Bharata was going to Citrakµu¢a intoxicated with Love for śrī Rāma, all inanimate objects that fell on the way turned animate, and all animate objects became lifeless as it were at the very sight of his Love. What was the condition of Bharata himself, whose very sight infused life into lifeless objects and made sentient creatures lifeless, as it were, could be known to Bharata alone. This type of unselfish Love is what is called pure Love, transcendent and stainless Love. It is free from all blemish and is exclusive in its nature. It is brightly effulgent, though not exactly like the sun; the effulgence it contains is the supreme stainless effulgence of Knowledge; it is sweeter and more immortalizing than ambrosia itself. We should all endeavour to realize this essence of true bliss. What we should do, therefore, is to cultivate dispassion towards all objects that provide only momentary enjoyment, but which are in essence the very roots of sorrow, and fixing our mind on the Paramātmā, who is Love-incarnate, love Him from the core of our heart. The very day our Love takes the form of a ceaseless stream, we shall realize God. If, therefore, the reader believes in the truth of what has been stated above, if he has the fullest confidence that through the scrupulous pursuit of the discipline for God-realization he must succeed in realizing God, then with a sincere heart he should withdraw his mind from the objects of enjoyment of the world, which are transitory and painful in essence, and which appear pleasant only through ignorance, and devote it to God, who is absolute existence, pure consciousness, and infinite bliss, with exclusive and whole-hearted love, which is the principal means of realizing Him.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">The Best Discipline for God-realization </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is a matter for great delight to me that through the supreme grace of the all-merciful Lord I have been afforded this splendid opportunity to place before my readers a few humble thoughts on the glory of the Divine Name. Truly speaking, the value of the ‘Name’ can be appraised by him alone whose mind remains constantly attached to it, who sheds tears of joy and feels a thrilling sensation from time to time through the sweet and loving memory of the ‘Name’, who cannot bear even a moment’s separation from the ‘Name’ and feels uneasy without it like a fish out of water, who cannot give up the ‘Name’ even for the twinkling of an eye and who has completely lost his identity in it through constant and loving repetition devoid of any selfish motive. Only such a blessed soul is fully qualified to describe the glory of the ‘Name’, and it is from his writing that the world may derive some benefit. As for myself, I am an ordinary man of the world without any capacity to describe the indescribable glory of the sacred Name which is productive of infinite spiritual good. I have launched myself into this attempt only under pressure from certain friends. I, therefore, crave the indulgence of my kind readers for the numerous shortcomings that will be noticed in this bold attempt of mine.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Glory of the Name<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>The glory of the Divine Name is infinite. This glory extends over all the Yugas. Our sacred books as well as saints and sages have by consensus of opinion recognized </span><span>its value and commended it unreservedly for all sages; but for the present age of Kali, they say, there is no other method equally efficacious for the attainment of salvation. Thus, the Purāṇas say:—</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">हरेर्नाम हरेर्नाम हरेर्नामैव केवलम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कलौ नास्त्येव नास्त्येव नास्त्येव गतिरन्यथा॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the age of Kali the Name of śrī Hari is the best means for attaining salvation. Except this there is no other method.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">कृते यद् ध्यायतो विष्णुं त्रेतायां यजतो मखै:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">द्वापरे परिचर्यायां कलौ तद्धरिकीर्तनात्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The spiritual gain derived from meditation on Bhagavān Viṣṇu in Satyayuga, from performance of sacrifices in Tretā, from worship of God in Dwāpara, is attained in Kaliyuga through mere Kīrtana (loud chanting) of God’s Name.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Says Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In Kaliyuga the Divine Name is the only resort; </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Constantly remembering it, O mortals, cross this ocean of worldly existence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no Yuga like the Kaliyuga, if one has faith in this statement:</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Singing the stainless glories of śrī Rāma one can cross the ocean of worldly existence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Instal the Name of śrī Rāma, which is like an effulgent gem, on the threshold of thy tongue,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If thou wouldst have thyself illumined.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even those who have renounced all desires and are steeped in love of śrī Rāma,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Have merged their hearts in the nectarean love of Divine Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whereas the Lord of Raghus bestowed salvation on devoted servants like śabarī (the Bhīl woman) and the vulture (Ja¢āyu), </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The name rescued innumerable wretches: this virtue of the Name is revealed in the Vedas. He who seeks in abode of peace without remembering śrī Rāma,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though possessed of wisdom, he is no better than a quadruped without tail and horns. It may be possible to obtain Ghee by churning water, and oil may be extracted from sand,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But the ocean of worldly existence cannot be crossed except through remembrance of śrī Hari: this conclusion cannot be set aside.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By fondly repeating the Name. The devotee easily becomes a veritable home of joy and blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through muttering of Name, Prahlāda secured the blessing of the Almighty Lord And became the crest-jewel of devotees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through remembrance of the sacred Name the son of wind-god (Hanumān)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Made śrī Rāma a captive of his heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ajāmila as well as the Lord of elephants and the harlot too, </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All got salvation through the name of śrī Hari</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In all the four Yugas, in the past, present and future, as well as in all the three regions Jīvas succeeded in overcoming grief through repetition of the Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How far shall I describe the glory of the Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Rāma Himself is unable to recount its glory.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I can quote any number of texts in support of the glory of the Divine Name; our scriptures are full of them, but I refrain from quoting more lest the article may assume dimensions out of all proportion. Almost all the religious systems of the world recognize in one form or another the glory of the Name of God and sing its praises. The names, of course, differ according to the taste and temperament of the votary. But being names of the same Paramātmā they all possess the same efficacy. Therefore, what one should do is to select a Name of his own choice and begin practising its Japa (muttering) with meditation side by side .</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Personal Experiences<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some friends have pressed me to relate my own personal experiences in the matter. But what am I to write when I know that my output of Nāma-Japa has not been quantitatively large? I find it difficult even to describe in full the benefit I derived from what little practice of the Divine Name I could carry on through the grace of the Divine Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I started the practice of muttering the Name even when I was a boy, as a result of which my attachment for objects of enjoyment gradually got attenuated and it proved a great help to me in guarding myself against sin. Passions like lust and anger gradually slackened their hold on me and peace dawned within my heart. Now and then as I closed my eyes I could meditate well on the Form of Bhagavān śrī Rāmacandra. Thoughts of the world subsided to a great extent. The attraction for objects of enjoyment disappeared and I developed a taste for a forest life or a life of seclusion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As I was thus engaged in spiritual practice I saw in a dream, one day, Bhagavān śrī Rāma accompanied by śrī Sītā and śrī Lakṣmaṇa and also had the privilege of conversing with them. śrī Rāma pressed me hard for asking a boon, but I had no inclination to ask for anything; eventually, even when I was further pressed, I sought for no other boon except that I might never part from Him. All this happened through the power of the Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Subsequent to this I derived even greater benefit from the practice of Nāma-Japa, but I find myself unable to describe its magnitude. I can, however, unhesitatingly say that except the study of the Bhagavadgītā no other discipline proved so efficacious for my spiritual growth as the practice of muttering the Divine Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whenever I found myself confronted with any serious obstacle which threatened to divert me from the path of spiritual progress. I used to take recourse to Nāma-Japa with loving devotion along with meditation, and invariably I surmounted those obstacles through the practice. Therefore, it is my firm belief that there is no discipline which is equal to the loving practice of Nāma-Japa accompanied by meditation of the Form of the Lord for removal of obstacles on the path of spiritual advancement and for setting at rest the worldly impulses arising within the mind. When I was able to derive such a supreme peace, such an infinite joy and such incomparable benefit as I cannot adequately describe; through such a meagre output of Nāma-Japa, who can describe the extent of joy experienced by the blessed soul who is constantly engaged in this practice of Nāma-Japa and meditation in an altogether disinterested spirit?</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">An Apology for N<span>ā</span>ma-Japa<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The śruti says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्धॺेवाक्षरं ब्रह्म एतद्धॺेवाक्षरं परम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्धॺेवाक्षरं ज्ञात्वा यो यदिच्छति तस्य तत्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The syllable ‘OË’ is Brahma Itself, it is the supreme reality. Knowing this syllable ‘OË’ one may obtain whatever he desires.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to this declaration of śruti, remembrance of God is a wish-yielding tree by recourse to which one can get whatever he desires. But true devotees who seek only spiritual welfare should practise remembrance of God in a thoroughly disinterested spirit. It is such disinterested and sincere devotees who have been highly extolled in the scriptures. The Lord also says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Four types of virtuous men worship Me, Arjuna—the seeker of worldly objects, the sufferer, the seeker for knowledge, and the man of wisdom. Of these the best is the man of wisdom, constantly established in identity with Me and possessed of exclusive devotion. For extremely dear am I to the wise man (who knows Me in reality), and he is extremely dear to Me”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> (Gītā VII. 16-17).</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जना: सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन।</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who knows the power and efficacy of such disinterested, sincere and absorbing practice of the Name can never forget the Lord even for a moment and He, too, cannot forget such a devotee. The Lord Himself says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all beings, and sees all beings existing in Me, I am never out of sight of him, nor is he ever out of sight of Me.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span><span></span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Can a true lover ever enthrone in his heart anyone else than the object of his love? Those blessed souls who knowing the glory of the all-blissful Divine, make Him the sole object of their love, remain absorbed day and night in the remembrance of His dear Name. They neither seek nor like any other object.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Until this stage is reached the following course of discipline may be adopted. While uttering the Name one should get so deeply absorbed in love that he may lose consciousness of the very existence of his body. Let him not solicit or even desire anything else than loving devotion of the purest type and the privilege of a Divine vision even in moments of the greatest trial. Let him not hanker for any worldly object.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The aspirant who practises Nāma-Japa disinterestedly, sincerely, and devotedly in the prescribed manner can achieve good results within a short time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be urged here that a good many people are seen practising Nāma-Japa without any appreciable results. Our answer to this contention is that either those people did not possibly practise Nāma-Japa in the prescribed manner at all or they purchased some trifling worldly enjoyment in lieu of the supreme wealth of Nāma-Japa. Had it not been the case, they would have doubtless derived adequate spiritual benefit from their practice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, Nāma-Japa should never be practised for the satisfaction of any worldly desire, be it great or small; it should be practised only for the attainment of unalloyed Love of God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">How to Practise Nāma-Japa?<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Maharṣi PataÛjali says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘तस्य वाचक: प्रणव:।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Yoga-Sµutra 1.27)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The indicator of Paramātmā, that is, His Name is Praṇava (OË).” Again,</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Ibid., 1.28)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Japa of this Name should be practised along with the contemplation of Its meaning, i. e., meditation on the essence of God.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘तत: प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Ibid., 1.29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Through the aforesaid practice all obstacles are removed and God-realization takes place.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This proves that the Japa of the Divine Name should be practised simultaneously with meditation on the Divine Essence. The Japa when it is joined with meditation on the Divine Essence removes all obstacles and brings about realization of God. It is, of course, true that the possessor of the Name is under the influence of the Name. Says Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The Form is observed as being subordinate to the Name,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Without the Name no knowledge of Form is possible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the Name is remembered without seeing the Form,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The latter manifests in the heart through excess of Love.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">आवत हृदयँ सनेह बिसेषें॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus through Nāma-Japa alone without any effort to meditate on the Divine form, the aspirant can automatically obtain a vision of God when the time comes for it. But this is a tardy process. If the Japa is practised, simultaneously with meditation on the enchanting Form of the Lord, the result will be speedily obtained. For in constant meditation there is no break in the remembrance of God. The Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, Arjuna, think of Me at all times and fight. With mind and reason thus surrendered to Me, you will doubtless come to Me.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span><span class="char-style-override-14"></span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the above injunction of the Lord, aspirants should constantly practise meditation on the Divine Essence with the mind and determine it with the intellect simultaneously with Nāma-Japa in all conditions and all postures of the body, and even while performing their ordinary worldly duties so that there may be no interruption in the remembrance of God even for a moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be asked here which Name of God possesses the greatest spiritual efficacy, and what Form of God should be meditated upon? Our answer to this question is that the aspirant derives the greatest benefit from the Japa of the Name which appeals to him the most and evokes his greatest reverence. He should, therefore, adopt the Name of his own choice for Japa and meditate on the Form which he likes best. Care should, of course, be taken that the Form to be meditated upon corresponds with the Name selected for Japa. Thus, for instance, one who selects the formula <span class="char-style-override-15">‘ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय’</span><span class="char-style-override-7">;</span> (Obeisance to Lord Vāsudeva) for Japa should meditate on Vāsudeva, the all pervading Divinity. Similarly, those who select the formula <span class="char-style-override-15">‘ॐ नमो नारायणाय’</span><span class="char-style-override-7">;</span> (Obeisance to Lord Nārāyaṇa) and <span class="char-style-override-15">‘ॐ नम: शिवाय’</span><span class="char-style-override-7">; </span>(Obeisance to Lord śiva) should meditate on the Forms of Bhagavān Viṣṇu and Lord śaṅkara respectively. Even so, one who adopts the sacred syllable ‘OË’ for Japa should meditate on the all-pervading Absolute Reality which is a compact mass of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss. Finally those who adopt the Name of śrī Rāma for Japa will find it profitable to meditate on the Form of Bhagavān śrī Rāmacandra, son of King Daśaratha. As for those who adopt the formula:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे।</p>
<p class="Shlok">हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">They may use for meditation the Divine Form of <br/>śrī Rāma, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, śrī Viṣṇu or the all-pervading <br/>Brahma according to their individual taste and <br/>temperament inasmuch as the Name occurring in the <br/>formula represent all those Forms.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above illustrations are intended to show that the aspirant will derive greater benefit from the Japa and meditation of the Name and Form into which he has been initiated by his preceptor, nay, which commands his greatest reverence, love and faith, and which appeals to his soul. Of course, it is essential that Japa should be accompanied by meditation. In fact, the name should invariably awaken memory of the Possessor of the Name. Each time a person utters the name of a particular object, his memory of that object must be awakened by the mention of its name even for a while, thus producing a good or bad impression according to the nature of the object. For instance, the memory of incidents full of pathos or the heroic sentiment, will fill your mind with those sentiments.The memory of a noble and exalted soul will rouse noble sentiments, and the memory of wicked soul will rouse evil sentiments in your mind. When the remembrance of ordinary worldly things, possesses this potency, there is no wonder that the remembrance of God should rouse divine sentiments in your heart and bring divine attributes before your mind. Therefore, an aspirant should try to lose himself in the raptures of Divine Love and make special efforts to carry on constantly and disinterestedly amidst all his multifarious duties the Japa of the Divine Name accompanied by meditation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">How Satsaṅga Strengthens <br/>Faith in the Name<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the glory of the Divine Name is so great, how is it that people do not devote themselves heart and soul to the practice of the Divine Name and meditation? Our answer to this question is that the true value of remembrance of God can be assessed by him alone who fully enjoys the grace of God. It is no doubt true that His grace extends in an equal degree on all, but one cannot profit by it unless and until he recognizes its infinite greatness. One may have some treasure hidden in an underground vault of his house, but unless the owner of the house knows where the vault is, he cannot make use of that wealth. When, however, he comes to know of its existence from some one who has knowledge of it, and unearths the treasure after some exertion, then only he can utilize that wealth. Even so, one discovers the eternal grace of God only through association with souls who possess a direct knowledge of His grace and its glory; through knowledge of the grace the true value of Bhajana (remembrance of God) is recognized, then one betakes himself to the practice of Bhajana and through constant and uninterrupted practice of Bhajana all the accumulated sins are washed away root and branch and one attains the <span class="char-style-override-8">summum bonum</span> of his life in the shape of God-realization.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Inherent Potency of Name <br/>to Destroy Sins<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here it may be urged that if God destroys or forgives the sins of those who practise His Bhajana, He thereby exposes Himself of the charge of partiality. Our answer to this contention is that just as fire possesses the inherent property of ignition and illumination even so the Divine Name possesses the inherent power of destroying sins. It is, therefore, that the Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am equally present in all beings; there is none hateful or dear to Me. They, however, who devoutly worship Me abide in Me, and I also stand revealed in them.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">ददामि बुद्घियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This clearly shows that God is never partial. Of numerous people oppressed by cold, fire protects from cold and relieves the suffering of those alone who approach the fire and expose their bodies to it, while those who do not approach it are not relieved of their suffering. This does not expose fire to the charge of partiality because it is always prepared to relieve the suffering of anyone who approaches it, by transmitting its heat to him. If anyone does not approach it at all, the fire is not to blame for it. Similarly, God purifies the heart and relieves the suffering of all who engage themselves in the pursuit of His Bhajana and blesses them. Therefore no blame of partiality can attach to God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Practice of the Name Itself <br/>Brings Enlightenment<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Question—</span>Granted that the Divine Name destroys our sins, but how can it help in the realization of the Supreme State, because that state is attained only through Knowledge?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Answer—</span>True, the Supreme State is realized only through Knowledge. But if the Divine Name is practised disinterestedly with reverence, love and faith, God vouchsafes that divine know<span>ledge to the devotee which enables the latter to realize the truth about Him, and </span><br/>through realization of that truth he undoubtedly attains the Supreme State. The Lord Himself says:—<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“With their mind fixed on Me, with their lives surrendered to Me, enlightening one another about My greatness and speaking of Me, they ever remain contented and take delight in Me. On those ever united through meditation with Me and worshipping Me with love, I confer that Yoga of wisdom through which they attain Me. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to shower My grace on them, I, dwelling in their heart, dispel the darkness born of ignorance by the shining light of wisdom”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> (Gītā X 9—11).</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, constant, disinterested and loving practice of Nāma-Japa together with meditation on the Divine Essence automatically gives rise to Divine Knowledge and through that Knowledge the aspirant immediately attains the Supreme State.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Name Should Never Be <br/>Lightly Treated</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are some friends who having no idea of the importance of Nāma-Japa, light-heartedly proceed to speak of it in disparaging terms. They say the practice of the Name is no better than the mechanical muttering of a meaningless sound. They further allege that to indulge in this hypocritical practice is to idle away one’s time and waste one’s life, and so on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I would request such friends to desist from this harmful attempt to unsettle the minds of those who believe in the efficacy of the Name and practise it, by speaking lightly of the practice without proper investigation. Nay, I would invite them to practise the Japa for some time and see for themselves what the Name can do. It is no use incurring sin by speaking disparagingly of the Divine Name or treating it lightly.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Lapse in Nāma-Japa through <br/>Negligence or Sloth is Inadvisable<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are many people who recognize the utility of Nāma-Japa or remembrance of God, but fail to adopt it through negligence or sloth. This is, however, a great mistake on their part. What shall we say of those who having secured this invaluable yet perishable gift of a human body are slack in practising Bhajana (remembrance of God)? The utility of this life lies in adhering to the Name. If we throw away this rare opportunity through our own carelessness,  we shall reap nothing but repentance hereafter.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">The great saint Kabīra says:—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“You are sure to die one day, when your very Name will be forgotten.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Leaving this populous village, you will go to inhabit a desolate wilderness instead,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today or tomorrow, or a few days later, you will have to take up your abode in a dreary forest; </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">And your remains will be run over by the ploughshare and overgrown with verdure which will serve as food for the cattle,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today you say you will remember God tomorrow, and tomorrow you postpone it for the next day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus putting it off from day to day, you will spend your whole life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you propose to start your practice of remembering God tomorrow, start it this very day; and if you propose to start the practice today, do it this very instant.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If Death overtakes you the very next moment, when will you do it?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, avoiding carelessness and sloth, one should form the habit of practising Bhajana in any case, at every time, and in every condition, even while attending to one’s legitimate duties.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother places toys of different kinds before the child in order to divert its attention, and also gives it some eatables. The child that leaves weeping through attraction for those things is left alone by the mother, who thus finds time to attend to other duties. But the child who refuses to be tempted by these things and goes on crying for the mother compels her to come and take it up in her arms. The mother has to leave all her household duties in order to appease and fondle such a refractory child, because she knows that the child seeks nothing else than her loving arms and cannot be beguiled by anything else.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, God also tries to beguile the devotee by placing before him allurements of various kinds of his own liking, just in order to test his devotion. One who falls an easy prey to such allurement fails in the test. But for the fortunate devotee who spurns all objects of the world, knowing them to be quite insignificant, transient and <br/>perishable, and goes on continually and sincerely crying for the loving embrace of the Divine Mother, who is All-Truth, All-Consciousness and All-Bliss, the latter has to leave all other work and present Herself before him without delay. Saint Kabīra says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Call out only ‘Keśava, Keśava’; do not indulge in meaningless jargon; </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Calling Him day and night, you will certainly make yourself heard some day,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Go on repeating the Name of Rāma till there is life in your body; </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The humming of your voice will surely reach the ears of the compassionate Lord one day.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is, therefore, our paramount duty to withdraw our mind from all objects of the world, knowing them to be a curse in the garb of blessing, and engage ourselves in the Japa of the sacred Name of the Paramātmā. One who practises the Japa of the Divine Name is soon liberated by the merciful Lord from the bondage of birth and death.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here it may be urged that God is only just inasmuch as He destroys the sins of, and grants salvation to those alone who remember Him. Why, then, should He be called merciful?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above contention does not stand the test of reason. Whereas earthly sovereigns gratify those who serve them by offering worldly possessions to them, such is not the case with God. The practice with Him is to reciprocate the feelings with which the worshipper approaches Him:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, howsoever men approach Me, even so do I seek them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God does not make any distinction between the high and the low. He meets the humblest creature exactly in the manner the latter approaches Him, and fully responds to his sentiments. If anyone weeps for Him and gets impatient to meet Him, He too gets equally impatient to see him. Is this not an indication of His boundless mercy?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, renouncing all the illusory enjoyments of the transient and perishable world, one should constantly engage himself in the disinterested and loving practice of muttering the sacred Name of the Almighty Lord, who is the very embodiment of justice, purity, compassion and love, together with contemplation on His Divine Essence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Nāma-Japa is the sovereign remedy for all worldly ills and the best means of God-realization.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The scriptures and saints have been and are admonishing us by beat of drum, yet the wonder of it is that we do not open our eyes. The human body, being the best of all bodies and conducive to salvation, has been recognized as a rare boon. Birth as a human being among the numberless species of earthly beings, the land of Bhāratavarṣa (India) among all lands, and the Sanātana Vedic Religion among all religions have been regarded as the best. No species superior to the human species is found anywhere on this globe. The land of Bhāratavarṣa is the fountain-head from which spiritual knowledge has flowed into the whole world. That is to say, most of the great world teachers of religion derived their knowledge of the spirit from India. Besides, the religion of the Vedas is beginningless and eternal, all other religions and creeds came into existence after it and are more or less based on it. Votaries of other faiths though not recognizing it as without a beginning, admit it to be the earliest of all religions. Thus the superiority of these three is proved even by Logic. Those who are born as human beings in such a country, and under the influence of such a religion, and yet do not wake up to their responsibility, will have greatly to repent for their error.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“They will suffer in the next world and rue their mistake. And will falsely blame Time (the Kali Age) and the inexorable Law of Karma and God, (who operates the Law) for their suffering.”<span class="char-style-override-10">* </span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">But it will be a mistake on their part to blame anyone else for what has been brought about by their own negligence; for though this age of Kali is the repository of all evils, it is very helpful in bringing about salvation.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“O king, though Kali is the repository of all evils, it has one great virtue, viz., that in this age through mere chanting of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s Name and glories one is freed from the bondage of worldly attachments and attains the Paramātmā.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, man can attain the supreme state  through mere chanting of the glories of God, Prārabdha (Destiny), too, cannot stand in the way of our pursuing a course of discipline for the emancipation of the soul.

<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa says:—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The immortal Jīva appearing on earth migrates from one womb to another among the eighty-four lacs of species, under the influence of Māyā caught in the whirligig of Time, Swabhāva (Nature) and Guṇas (traits); God, whose love is unmotived, out of compassion gives him occasionally the privilege of human body.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Is it not foolishness to blame God even under such circumstances? If we were born as monkeys to work out our Karma, we would have moved among trees leaping from one branch to another; if born as birds we would have fluttered in the forest, if born as pigs or puppies, we would have dragged our miserable existence on the outskirts of towns or villages. What more could we do in that condition? Let the reader judge for himself the magnitude of God’s compassion. He has given  <span class="char-style-override-16"> </span>us a rare opportunity by blessing us with this human body. This opportunity should never be lost by us. Such an opportunity must have been given to us many a time before, but we did not avail it then, and once more it has been vouchsafed to us. We should make a very prudential use of it this time, realizing that great, pious Emperors like Māndhātā and Yudhiṣ¢hira, mighty long-lived Asura like Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa, regional gods like Varuṇa (god of water), Kubera (god of wealth) and Yama (god of Death) himself and even lords of celestial beings like Indra have appeared and disappeared many a time leaving their bodies and glories, and could not carry even an empty shell with them. We should, therefore, consider how much more ephemeral is the relation of us, short-lived human beings, with this earthly body, wealth, family and glory.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Under such circumstances is it not wonderful that like one intoxicated by a drink of strong wine, we forget all these things and waste our valuable life in pursuit of transient earthly enjoyments, which are, in fact, the root of all misery, or in amassing wealth, which procures these enjoyments, nourishing the body and maintaining our family? We had no relation with these objects of enjoyment before, nor will this relation be maintained here after. How is it, then, that we have come to regard the accumulation of these objects as the summum bonum of our life? Life is short, death is lying in wait for us; suddenly without any notice it will pounce upon us and seize us. While there is life in the body, while it does not show signs of decay and while we can exercise control over it, we should do all we can, to achieve the object for which we have come into this world. The royal sage Bhartr̥hari says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A wise man should make the best efforts for his salvation while his body is in sound health, while old age is still at a distance, while the senses are unimpaired and while not much of his life has been wasted. What is the good of attempting to dig a well when the house is already on fire?”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">This is our paramount duty which has remained undischarged to this day. Had this been performed before, we would not have found ourselves in the present deplorable condition. There is not a single species of life which we have not passed through at one stage or other of our beginningless existence. We have enjoyed the pleasures of all lives from the lowest species, such as the ant, to the highest class of beings such as Indra, the lord of heaven; yet we have not reached the end of our journey, because we have not gone through the necessary spiritual discipline and shall continue to wander to unless and until we strive for our spiritual welfare in right earnest. Thousands and lacs of Brahmās have come and gone, crores of Indras have occupied and vacated paradise one after another, and we, too, have undergone countless births; the particles of dust may be counted but not the number of our births. Lacs and crores of Kalpas (life-time of a Brahma) may roll on yet and still God cannot be realized without undergoing necessary spiritual discipline (<span class="char-style-override-7">साधना</span>); and without realizing God there will be no end to our peregrination. It is, therefore, essential that we should make it a point to practise constant remembrance of the Name and real nature of the Paramātmā and carry out His commandments. This is the shortest and easiest way to God-realization (Gītā VIII. 14; XII. 6-7). In order to be able to carry on this practice successfully one should seek the shelter and guidance of exalted souls who have attained true happiness. Through the contact, service and grace of such great souls alone, one is enabled to attain God by cultivating supreme reverence and exclusive Love through a knowledge of His virtues and glory. The grace of such exalted souls, again, falls on those who enjoy the grace of God. For, as Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa puts it:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He alone who enjoys the grace of śrī Rāma receives favour and kindness from all.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* जापर कृपा राम कै होई।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">तापर कृपा करइ सब कोई ॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is through the grace of God alone that one gets the opportunity of coming in contact with and serving a great soul. Although each of us enjoys the infinite grace of God equally, we do not recognize this fact due to our ignorance and are lost in the enjoyments of the world. That is why we fail to derive full benefit from that grace. Even though the philosopher’s stone may be lying in a poor man’s hut, he suffers all the pangs of poverty because he is ignorant of the virtues, efficacy and secret of that stone. Similarly, we lead a life of sorrow because of our ignorance of God and His mystery, glory, real nature and virtues.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For acquiring knowledge of these we should associate with and serve great soul, study books dealing with the Name, Form, glories and stories of the Lord, chant the same and dwell thereon in our mind. When we know the virtues and efficacy of a thing, we develop reverence and love for it, and the knowledge of its imperfections leads us to conceive hatred for it. This is a general law. And it is well-known fact that there is none equal to God either in virtue or in glory—God whose very thought has brought forth this universe, the mere winking of whose eyes means the creation and dissolution of the world, who is powerful enough to raise within the twinkling of an eye, a creature as insignificant as a fly to the position of Indra himself, and likewise to reduce a great being like Indra to the position of a fly—nay, who has the power to bring the impossible into the region of possibility and to render impossible what is ordinarily possible: in fact, there is nothing which is beyond the scope of His power. Although He is so great, He does not ignore those who worship Him; on the contrary, He begins to worship the worshipper Himself with the same degree of devotion and love. One who has come to know this secret even partially, how can he bear His separation even for a moment?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When sought by the humble, the distressed, the helpless or even the worst sinner, God does not take account of their vices or evil conduct but hugs them to His bosom like a loving mother. Can the person who comes to know the secret of this compassionate nature of the Supreme Puruṣa, who is supremely kind and the true friend of all, make any delay in raising a cry of distress for his <br/>own purification?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The virtues of forbearance, forgiveness, compassion, self-abnegation, serenity, love, wisdom, equanimity, fearlessness, affection, artlessness, tenderness, sweetness, friendliness, etc., are present in the Paramātmā in an infinite measure, and they are naturally imbibed by devotees who worship Him. One who knows this secret, cannot for a moment worship any object other than the Paramātmā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How can it be possible for a person who has known in the truth about God to transgress any injunction of God, the embodiment of love, humility and compassion, who knows the secret of love, nay, who is Love Personified, who though immeasurably great, follows His loving devotees and companions as a shadow?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Let alone him who has come to know His virtues and power, even one who has faith in the existence of such a virtuous and powerful Lord can never commit any sin; on the contrary, the thought of His virtues and power will, as a matter of course, infuse fearlessness, cheerfulness and tranquillity into his heart. At every step he receives support and protection from the Lord, which goes to accelerate his progress in Sādhanā and replenish the store of his vigour and zeal and this finally leads him to realization of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if this faith cannot be developed, one should not forget God even for a moment, as otherwise one may have to face a great calamity. For the scriptures as well as saints declare, and this is also supported by reason, that man attains whatever objects he meditates on at the time of his departure from this world. Whatever object man meditates on while going to sleep, he generally visualizes as a dream at night. Similarly, whatever he meditates on at the time of death, he attains in after life. If he meditates on God, he will attain God, if he meditates on the earthly objects of enjoyment, he will come back to earth. Should anyone imagine that he would fix his mind on God at the time of final parting, it would be a great mistake on his part to do so. At the time of death, one’s senses and mind get weak and exhausted, and it is the old habit that generally asserts itself. Therefore, being blessed with a human birth, we should not take the risk of deferring the contemplation of God to the last moment, that is to say, even if one finds himself unable to pursue any other discipline, he should at least form the habit of constant remembrance of God, His virtues and powers. No expense or labour is involved in this practice; on the contrary, it brings immediate joy and peace, and is very easy to perform. The only thing required, is faith. The rest will be accomplished as a matter of course. To cultivate this faith in God, one should hear from the lips of saints and other great souls, discourses on the Name, form, virtues, glory, love and sports of the Lord and dwell on the same in the mind. By doing so; one can develop faith in and supreme Love for God and thus attain Him easily through the grace of the saints and God Himself. But alas! for want of faith in God and the other world we have shut our eyes to the fact and instead of utilizing our precious life to the best advantage, viz., for attaining salvation, we waste it in enjoying the transient and ephemeral pleasures of the world. The momentary pleasure that we seem to derive from worldly objects is not true happiness, it is a deception. This can be realized by even a slight exercise of thought. God has endowed us with intellect and wisdom in order that we may make a prudent use of our time. Therefore, one who recklessly wastes his life gives only an indication of his ignorance. Who am I? What is the nature of this world? In what relation do I stand with this world? What use do I make of my time? What is my proper duty? These are questions which everyone of us should carefully consider.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All living creatures of this world seek happiness —happiness that is uninterrupted and unbounded, and no one desires that he should have the least amount of suffering at any time. But this does not happen. What generally happens, is just the opposite of what one seeks. The reason is that due to ignorance and short-sightedness, one does not make the best use of his time. Even those who are considered highly learned and wise in this world, regard worldly or material happiness as true happiness and madly pursue it out of infatuation. They hold true advancement to consist in the attempt to secure such happiness. According to many, accumulation of wealth which is a means of procuring worldly enjoyments, beings the highest object of life, forms the creation of advancement; while there are others who regard honour, prestige and fame to be the measure of success in life. But all this is nothing but foolishness, for these beings transient themselves, the pleasure derived through them is also nothing but transient. And because it is transient, the authors of the scriptures, the ¤Rṣis, have called it unreal. This is the view held by the scriptures and saints and it is also supported by reason. Whatever is real can never perish. However much the forces of death may contend against it, it will ever remain unshakable as a rock. And that which is unreal, can never endure, however much you may try to preserve it. Realizing all this, we should withdraw our mind, senses and intellect from the pursuit of transient, momentary pleasures of this world and employ them all in the attempt to attain true happiness. To advance in the path leading to that happiness, is the mark of true progress or success in life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, let us consider what is true happiness, and where it may be found. Also what is false happiness, and where does it lie. The only eternal, imperishable object in creation is the All-powerful Paramātmā who is compact mass of Consciousness and Bliss; therefore, happiness derived in relation to Him, is the true and eternal happiness. Worldly objects being themselves transitory and evanescent, pleasure that is derived through them is also transient and momentary. Now, let us consider how these objects and the pleasure through them are transient and ephemeral. Take the instance of cow’s milk. When it is freshly milked in the morning, its taste, appearance and quality are quite different; if however, it is held over till the evening all these things change; it does not retain the taste and quality possessed by it in the morning; even its appearance is changed, it gets a bit thicker. On the second or third day, it assumes a different character altogether, not only flavours, properties and appearance are completely changed, it acquires a different name as well. The milk is automatically transformed into curd, its sweetness turns into sourness; instead of being an antidote against flatulence and biliousness, it becomes favourable to their growth; from a flowing liquid it is changed into a thick mass. If it is kept over for ten days more, it will turn into a poison, highly injurious to health. Now even nectar-like substance like milk, being of a transitory character, loses its flavour, virtues, appearance and name even though it is kept thoroughly undisturbed. Had it been an eternal substance, it would not have undergone any change or decay. The same test may be applied in determining the nature of other objects. The happiness that appears to inhere in these worldly objects, is not true happiness. If the momentary flash of happiness appearing there in, is treated as happiness, the suffering with which they are attended, is even more pronounced; therefore, they should be rejected. Similarly, sexual enjoyment gives momentary pleasure, but a person who gets addicted to it will lose his health, strength, mental powers, energy and longevity and leading a miserable existence, will soon find himself within the jaws of death. And if it is indulged in contrary to injunction of the scriptures, it will bring him a bad name in this world and tortures of hell hereafter. Therefore, let us consider how much suffering, and for what length of time, one has to go through, in exchange for this momentary gratification. The same is true of other forms of sensual enjoyment inasmuch as all enjoyments weaken the senses and body, and make the heart impure, and the mind weak and unsteady; they lead to the exhaustion of religious merits earned in previous births and aggravation of sin. Not only this, they make even self-possessed and valiant souls self-indulgent and voluptuous and render them incapable of treading the path of God-realization. Even if any of them attempts to tread this path, he does not attain speedy results.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, it is a mistake to amass wealth with a view to enjoy the pleasures of the world, because, in the first place, acquisition of wealth involves a good deal of trouble and exertion. Not only that, it also involves the perpetration of a good many sins or undesirable acts which may require expiation in hell. Once it is amassed, its protection becomes a problem. Occasions arise when people have to risk their very life for its protection. No small trouble has to be faced even in its expenditure or in giving it away as alms. There is a popular saying to the effect that giving away wealth is as good as death. Its loss is attended with terrible suffering and sorrow. When one is forced to leave all his possessions behind and pass to the next world, his grief and sorrow know no bounds. Therefore, is it anything but foolishness to face all this terrible suffering for the sake of a momentary pleasure? Again, the pleasures of senses he seeks to obtain from his wealth, he cannot enjoy just as he pleases. The greatest men of the world who possessed great worldly wisdom and practical knowledge had to leave this wealth and depart with great repentance and sorrow. Even those who were endowed with great physical prowess and wielded immense power and influence could not carry their wealth with them, not to speak of puny mortals like ourselves. It is also not infrequently found that a certain individual amasses wealth and another enjoys it and spends it occasionally in a manner quite contrary to the wishes or expectations of the original possessor. Their case is analogous to that of the bee which gathers honey for the enjoyment of others and thus exhibits its rank folly. A bee is after all an ordinary insect not endowed with reason; but a human being, who fails to take this aspect into consideration, is even more foolish than the bee.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One earns a thousand rupees a day; but he is not satisfied with this amount and seeks to double his income. Suppose he is going to die tomorrow, and it is clear that after his death he will have no connection with his wealth. It is equally evident that death when it comes; comes quite unexpectedly and without any notice, and when it comes there is no escape for him even if he spends all his fortune and makes superhuman efforts to save himself. Death is inevitable for all. Such being human life, where is the exaggeration if people who are educated and have high-sounding titles prefixed or suffixed to their names, but whose only aim in life is accumulation of more and more wealth, are dubbed as more ignorant and foolish than the bee who gathers honey for the consumption of others?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nor can those who apply their mind, body and wealth to the sole purpose of achieving fame, be credited with wisdom; for fame and reputation constitute a hindrance to the attainment of true happiness, and we retain no connection with that fame after our departure from this world. Therefore, it is our humble submission to those who possess a superabundance of wealth and honour and whose minds are attached to objects of the world that are apart from God and Religion (Dharma) which consists in obeying God’s commandments, they have no true friend and guide in this world or the next. Therefore, even if they seek fame, their efforts should be solely directed towards God-realization; for when they attain identification with Brahma, or in other words, become one with the Paramātmā; then all the glory of Brahma sung in the Vedas and other scriptures and all the reputation and fame attaching to the names of śrī Rāma and śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, will belong to them. Not only this, all the fame that hangs as a canopy round this universe or will be woven about it, in future, in fact, belongs to them. For he who attains Brahmahood becomes one with the Self of all. That is how the reputation of all, becomes his reputation. And this reputation of all, again, is contained within a small fraction of his Self. The Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(X. 41)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Every such creature as is glorious, brilliant or powerful, know that to be a manifestation of a spark of My effulgence.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This should make us realize how foolish it is to hanker after worldly fame, which is so trivial and insignificant, and waste our physical and mental energies and material wealth for its acquisition. In fact, realization of God, has not to be attained with a view to acquiring fame, it should be our supreme goal and chief support; for on realizing God nothing remains to be achieved or realized. This is what they call Mukti (Liberation), the supreme state, or <br/>true and abiding happiness. Just as the fire-fly or a drop of water cannot be compared to the sun or the ocean, even so the accumulated happiness of the entire world cannot be compared to the joy of attainment of that compact mass of consciousness and bliss. The Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वत: सम्प्लुतोदके।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तावान् सर्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 46)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A Brāhmaṇa who has obtained enlightenment, has the same use for all the Vedas as one has for a small reservoir of water in a place flooded with water on all sides.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as the pleasure of sovereignty over the three worlds enjoyed in a dream, cannot be compared to the most trifling pleasure of the waking state; if this sovereignty of the dream-state is offered for sale it will not fetch even a single farthing inasmuch as the entire suzerainty disappears as soon as the waking state is reached, even so on the attainment of the Paramātmā, the whole world before us and the enjoyments we derive therefrom will disappear like a magic. Therefore, can there be anything more short-sighted, more foolish than to waste one’s energy over the attainment of the momentary, false and evanescent pleasures of the world, ignoring the eternal, infinite joy of God-realization?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even more wondrous is the state of the devotee who worships God with the ecstasy and fulness of Love, keeping his identity separate from God. He seeks pleasure in the pleasure of the Lord, finds happiness in the happiness of the Lord. All his movements are directed towards the attainment of  exclusive Love for and eternal union with the Lord and winning His pleasure. Consecrating his all, body, mind and wealth, nay, his very self, to his beloved Lord, he gets enraptured  with excess of Love and joy. God alone is his sole refuge, his wealth, his life, his very soul. That is why such a devotee cannot bear His separation even for a moment. He constantly lives, moves, and has his being in his Beloved and delights in hearing, dwelling on and chanting His Name and the glories of His form, love, power and His secret sports.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He gets so much absorbed in the ecstasy of this joy, that he cares not even for the supreme state, or the Bliss of emancipation described above as attainable through identification with Brahma. Just as fish cannot bear separation from water even so separation from God becomes extremely unbearable to the devotee. Not only this, when God appears and clasps the devotee to His bosom, even the intervening clothes appear as a hindrance. He longs for eternal union without any intervening object, and will not like to be separated from him even for a moment. The glory of the devotee who is absorbed in this joy of God-realization, cannot be described in words even by great gods like śeṣa (the Serpent-god), Maheśa (Lord śiva) and Gaṇeśa (the god of wisdom), not to speak of ordinary mortals. God Himself, whose greatness and glory is sung by the seers and sages and saints of all times and climes and in all the Vedas, sings the glory of such a devotee and becomes a bondslave of his Love. He has to reveal His identity to him according to the conception he has of Him in his mind and engage in sportive and ecstatic dalliance with him; that is to say, He begins to do whatever may please the heart of the devotee.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is asked, what is the difference between these two forms of God-realization, that in which the devotee maintains his separate identity and that in which he merges his identity in God, the answer is that the Sādhaka following the latter path is himself transformed into true bliss or becomes one with the Paramātmā, who is a compact mass of consciousness and bliss, and the devotee who worships God through preservation duality, enjoys the divine bliss emanating from the blissful form of God, the Lord of all Rasas (shades of bliss), that is to say, he enjoys the blissful contact of Personal God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Speech or words can describe the experience up to this stage. Subsequent to this, the devotees of both the paths, attain the final state which is something indescribable and which even the Vedas and other śāstras, Devas and ¤Rṣis like śiva, śāradā (Goddess of Learning) and Sanaka and the saints and sages who have attained that state, find themselves utterly incapable of describing. Whatever is given out in the form of hints to indicate, that state falls too short of it. For words cannot describe the experience of that region, the portals of which cannot be entered even by the mind and the intellect.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Therefore, all of us should make the most persistent and determined effort to attain true happiness in the form of God-realization, spurning the evanescent, momentary and insignificant pleasures of the world which are nothing but roots of sorrow and hindrances in the path of God-realization. Through the grace of God Himself, His realization becomes easy for a devotee who undertakes to make a sincere effort on these lines.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">Divine Grace</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A friend has asked me the following question: “Is the grace of God subject to certain conditions or absolutely unconditional? How should we learn to see the operation of grace under all circumstances?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">My first submission in this connection is that it is impossible to describe in full the glory and greatness of divine grace through human speech. The reason for this, is that this glory is infinite, whereas whatever is described through speech, is finite. Even the little that any sage or seer understands about the mystery of grace, he cannot express through words. There is, in fact, no limit to this grace, which is being constantly showered by God on all His creatures. Whatever guesses are made about the immensity of this grace, fall too short of what it actually is.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Grace, because it flows equally and spontaneously towards all beings without any external cause or condition, may on the one hand, be described as unconditional or causeless. On the other, it may be described as conditional, inasmuch as the more a person believes in it, and the greater the extent of grace one believes himself to be enjoying, and the more correctly and fully he grasps its true character, the more palpably and visibly he profits by it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is from every point of view complete by Himself without any desire of His own; He is all powerful, the Almighty Lord and Master of all. How can He be conceived to have any wish or desire, so that any interested motive may be attributed to His grace? He is by His very nature, and without any cause, extremely compassionate and supremely benevolent to all; all His actions are guided by the sole purpose of doing good to all; although a non-doer, it is out of sheer compassion that He engages Himself in activities for universal good. Though not subject to birth, He incarnates Himself from time to time for the redemption of pious souls, for diffusing the light of religion, for the suppression of evil through the destruction of evil-doer<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> and for infusing love, and piety among the people through manifestation of His divine sports on earth. Though without attributes, formless and changeless, He has to take upon Himself a form and attributes in order to manifest Himself before His devotees, yielding to their Love. Though Lord of all, Almighty and thoroughly independent, He melts through love and makes Himself subservient to His devotees. His unmotived, causeless supreme grace is the sole cause of all these phenomena.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">* The Lord redeems the evil-doers even by killing them, as the scriptures say:—</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">लालने ताडने मातुर्नाकारुण्यं यथार्भके।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">तद्वदेव महेशस्य नियन्तुर्गुणदोषयो:॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Just as the mother is inspired by compassion both indulging and roughly handling a child, even so the mighty Lord is actuated by compassion both in rewarding a virtue and punishing an offence.”</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even those devotees or blessed souls who have attained God, who have realized the supreme glory of divine grace, who have themselves imbibed a share of that virtue, become altogether selfless; their relations with the world are no longer guided by self-interest. All their activities are solely guided by altruistic motives and do not have any selfish motive behind them. What wonder, then, if the divine grace is altogether unmotived. That the relations of God-realized souls with other souls are no longer guided by self-interest, is admitted by the Lord Himself, who says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. 18)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In this world that great soul has no use whatsoever forthings done, nor for things not done; nor has he selfish dependence of any kind on any creature.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even so, with reference to His own self, the Lord says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā III. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds for Me to do, nor is there anything worth attaining unattained by Me; yet I continue to work.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa also says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O Lord, in this wide world all friendship is tainted by selfishness, no one ever dreams of a higher aim in friendship. It is Thou and Thy servants (devotees) alone. O Chastiser of Demons, who are engaged in doing good to the world without any selfish motive.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* स्वारथ मित्र सकल जग माहीं।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">सपनेहुँ प्रभु परमारथ नाहीं॥</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">तुम्ह तुम्हार सेवक असुरारी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above description will show that though God and His devotees have no duty to perform, no interest to serve, they engage themselves in all forms of activities for the good of the people, that is, to guard them against sin and guide them along the noble path of morality, religion, and devotion to God. Their infinite grace or mercy is the only motive of their activities.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be asked here: If the divine grace extends equally on all in an infinite degree, how is it that all people do not attain salvation? A proper investigation into this question will show that people generally fail to take advantage of this grace because of their ignorance about its true nature.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>Though God is Almighty and supremely kind, he does not perform any action on His own initiative because He is absolutely impartial and disinterested. His mercy is evoked </span><span>and he is moved to action only when a devotee approaches Him with faith and love. This may be illustrated by the example of the holy Ganges which is incessantly flowing to wash away sins and redeem the world, and yet those who are not acquainted with the infinite glory and sanctifying power of the Ganges, or who fail to take advantage of it by bathing in it or drinking its water for lack of faith and reverence, cannot derive much benefit from its presence. Even so divine grace is incessantly flowing everywhere in a current more extensive and more comprehensive than the Ganges, and yet people do not bestir themselves to take advantage of it by taking refuge at the feet of all-merciful Lord, due to their ignorance about the glory of His grace and a general lack of faith and reverence.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">General benefit from the divine grace is derived by all beings in a uniform degree; but he who becomes a special object of His grace can derive benefit from it in a special degree. The light and rays of the sun are equally available to all at every place so that all derive equal benefit from it in a general way, but the rays of the sun are focussed in a special degree on a sun-stone which begins to emit fire as soon as the sun’s rays fall on it. Similarly, he who possesses a heart as transparent and pure as the sun-stone, that is to say, who is possessed of reverence and love for God in a special degree, is able to derive special benefit from the divine grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the three types of Karma of human beings, viz., SaÛcita (accumulated actions of the past, which have yet to bear fruit), Prārabdha (those which have already begun to bear fruit), and Kriyamāṇa (actions that are being newly performed and added to the store of SaÛcita Karma)—are closely connected with the divine grace. It is the divine grace which has been responsible for our past actions of a meritorious types, and the divine dispensation according to which such actions are rewarded with enjoyments in the present life, also operates for the good of creatures and is inspired by His unbounded mercy. That is why those who have understood the secret of His grace, visualize its benign operation in every decree of Providence and in every condition. Virtuous actions in the present life are also attributable to his grace, it is his grace which guides us along the path of virtue. This divine grace is eternally associated with every form of Karma of human beings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If things are scrutinizingly observed with the eye of reverence and faith every man can visualize the operation of the divine grace at every step and every moment of his life and under all circumstances. All the creatures of this world derive their subsistence and joy from elements like water, air, light, etc., their very life is sustained by them. The divine grace permeates through all these elements in a uniform degree.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The divine dispensation which regulates enjoyment and suffering according to virtuous and sinful deeds committed in the past is also inspired by His grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Divine Law according to which accumulated sins of innumerable births are expiated by even a little amount of practice of Japa, meditation and association with holy men, reveals nothing but the infinite grace of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">His grace is, again, particularly manifested when He reveals Himself in a visible form before devotees who take refuge in Him, and a loving and piteous appeal for such manifestation removes their suffering and distress, protects in everyway those who seek shelter under Him and guards them against sin. It is singularly and exceptionally kind of Him to reveal Himself on His own initiative, unasked and unsolicited, before a devotee who is firmly-rooted in devotion like Prahlāda just in order to bless him with His auspicious sight and protect him from all danger.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">His grace is also particularly revealed in weaning people from the path of sin and putting them on the right track through the agency of holy men and sacred books, or through promptings of their hearts or even by incarnating Himself on earth. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Man should learn to visualize the operation of His grace under all circumstances, favourable or unfavourable, namely, in the possession or loss of objects of worldly enjoyment such as wife, children, wealth or lodging; in the enjoyment of good health or in failing health; in adversity and sorrow as well as in prosperity and abundance.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When there is abundance of objects of enjoyment one should cultivate the feeling that God has bestowed these objects on him as a reward for meritorious acts done in the past, so as to enable him to administer to the comforts of others, to perform more acts of virtue, to develop love for God and to employ them in the service of God. He alone has truly grasped the secret of divine grace who makes use of these objects for the bare maintenance of his body, and devotes all the rest to the service of God. He who utilizes them for personal enjoyment does not understand the truth about His grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When these objects of enjoyment are lost we should cultivate the feeling that they were hindrances in the path of devotion in so far as we looked upon them as objects of enjoyment and had developed attachment for them. It is therefore that the supremely merciful Lord has so kindly removed them all, in order to draw us towards Him, which is an act of supreme grace on His part. In this world we observed flies and other insects being attracted by flames; out of ignorance they rush into the flame and are reduced to ashes. Seeing their sorry plight a tender-hearted person is moved by compassion and removes the flame out of their reach, or puts it out. The person removing the flame is actuated by supreme compassion for the flies, though the flies themselves do not realize it. To them he appears as most unkind, their sworn enemy. But this is nothing but ignorance and a mistake on their part. Similarly, there are simple-minded folk amongst us, who not knowing the secret of divine grace begin to imprecate God when they find themselves gradually losing their worldly possessions. But God is an Ocean of Mercy, He takes no notice of the impudence of such persons. He alone knows the true secret of grace; who sees the operation of grace even in the loss of worldly possessions and remains cheerful under all circumstances, knowing as he does that he has been deliberately deprived of these things by God in His supreme mercy, in order to expiate his past sins, and to guard against future sins, and in order to arouse in his mind a pronounced aversion for worldly enjoyments by revealing their transitory and ephemeral nature.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even so when the body is in sound health, one should cultivate the feeling that the Lord is pleased to keep his body in sound health in order that he may be able to serve all creature seeing the presence of God in them and realizing His all-pervasiveness; that he may realize the truth and secret of God’s greatness and glory through association with superior souls and that he may practise constant Bhajana (remembrance) and meditation on God. He who dedicates this ephemeral body to the service of the all-merciful Lord on the lines indicated above alone knows the true secret of divine grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the body is in the grip of some malady,the feeling should be cultivated that the ailment has been sent by God out of sheer compassion in order to enable him in reaping his past sins, to guard him against future commission of sins, to help him to cultivate an attitude of dispassion and indifference towards the body, to teach him how to make capital out of physical ailments by treating them as austerities and reaping the fruit thereof, and, lastly, to remind him of God every now and then. He alone knows the true secret of divine grace who cultivating this attitude does not sorrow over his illness and cheerfully engages his mind in the constant remembrance of God, and appreciating the benevolent intention of God, remains ever jubilant at heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same manner, one should see the operation of divine grace when he meets or is separated from an individual, happy or miserable, a saint or a sinner, or whenever any contact is established with any individual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When he meets a superior soul, he should persuade himself to believe that the meeting has been arranged by supreme God in His infinite mercy so as to enable him to emulate His virtues and develop love for God by following His instructions.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When separated from him, he should believe that this separation has been brought about by God out of sheer compassion, in order to make him realize that constant association with such a soul is a rare privilege and further in order to arouse in him a strong desire to meet him again, and also to intensify his love for that exalted soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When thrown together with wicked and immoral persons he should believe that such a meeting has been arranged by God to help him to develop disgust for evil propensities and immoral practices by showing him the evils of such practices.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When separated from such persons he should believe that the separation has been brought about by God out of sheer compassion for him in order to protect him from the evils of bad company.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When thrown in the company of unhappy men or creatures, he should believe that this has been ordained by God to help him to develop tenderness of heart and further to afford him an opportunity to serve those creatures, and develop otherworldliness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When he meets such people or creatures, as are happy and contented, he should believe that this meeting has been kindly arranged by God in order that he may learn how to rejoice over the happiness of others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When separated from these, he should cultivate the feeling that an opportunity has been afforded by God out of compassion for him to overcome his attachment for society and develop total indifference towards the world and to enable him to practise remembrance of God and meditation with assiduity in seclusion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this manner, one should learn to see the operation of divine grace through every incident at all times and under all circumstances. Through this practice one can derive special benefits by knowing and realizing how the infinite grace of God is eternally flowing through and enriching the life of every being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The grace of the all-merciful divine on all beings is so great in its extent that it is impossible for man to comprehend it in its entirety; the maximum of grace that he can conceive himself to be enjoying, falls too short of the extent of grace he is actually enjoying. Man can never form a correct picture of the true nature of divine grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">People describe God as an ocean of mercy, but careful consideration will show that this is not a correct description of God, it gives only a partial indication of His infinite grace. The ocean is a finite thing limited in space, whereas divine grace is infinite and unlimited. People try to indicate this infinite character of grace through the metaphor of the ocean because there is nothing on this globe of ours which is larger in extent than the ocean.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though the grace of God on all creatures is unlimited, people cannot derive much benefit from it because of their ignorance about its true character, and due to their own folly, remain constantly merged in sorrow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The glory of grace is infinite; man can secure as much advantage through it as he may like to secure. So long as the truth and secret of this grace is not understood, it yields ordinary results in a general way; but the more it is understood, the more beneficent it proves; and the result is simply marvellous if we regulate our conduct according to our conception there of.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The glory of divine grace is so great that when one comes to realize the truth about it, it helps him like the philosopher’s stone to use it to its best advantages. For instance, the stone may be lying in a poor man’s hut without his knowledge, he may be using it as an ordinary stone. Knowing it, as he does, to be an ordinary stone, he cannot derive much advantage from it, he can take only as much work from it as he would from an ordinary piece of stone. But if after being used for a long time as an ordinary stone, it accidentally comes in contact with a piece of iron,  it shows its marvellous effect and secures much advantages to its owner. And if by seeing with his own eyes the miracle of the iron being transformed into gold or through admonition received from a person who knows its value, the poor man comes to know that it is no ordinary stone but a philosopher’s stone, he realizes its true value and glory, and acting on that knowledge, derives the fullest advantage from it. Similarly when through some special incident or the contact of a superior soul, man realizes to a certain extent the secret, truth and glory of divine grace, that knowledge itself incites him to act in a manner which makes him derive the fullest benefit from that grace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who comes to know the secret that God is supremely merciful and the dearest friend of all immediately attains final peace. The Lord Himself says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Having known Me in reality as the selfless friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Why should he not attain it? We see it in our daily life that when we come to have a definite knowledge with regard to a merchant prince or a big landlord or ruler that the latter is kind-hearted and possesses some authority, that he is equally kind to all and that he knows us and desires to meet us and love us, how great is our joy, how much solace and comfort we derive, and how eagerly do we try to meet him and make the most of his acquaintance. What wonder, then, if he who comes to believe that God, who is the Almighty Ruler of countless millions of universes, is at the same time supremely kind and friendly to all, and is, in fact, anxious to love him, and willing to meet those who are anxious to meet Him, should try to make the best use of His grace and attain Supreme Peace. He who comes to know the secret of His grace, himself comes to possess an extremely tender heart and begins to love all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He realizes God Himself and becomes the dearest object of His love; nay, he is united with God. The Lord Himself says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For extremely dear am I to the wise man (who knows Me in reality), and he is extremely dear to Me.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VII. 17)</p>
<p class="Footnotes">* प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रिय:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Thus the infinite grace of that all-merciful, all-powerful and all-loving divine is naturally and constantly being showered on us all; we are profiting by it in a general way every moment of our life. He gave us an ocular demonstration of this grace when He came down on this earth with a seemingly human body. Considering these facts we should exert ourselves to the best of our ability to understand the secret, truth and glory of His grace. This human body has been vouchsafed to us as an expression of His unmotived grace. It is in this body and this body alone that we can understand the inwardness of His grace and become an object of supreme love to God. Life is ebbing fast every moment, and it is impossible to get such an opportunity again. The time that has already passed will not return to us. This valuable human life should not be idled away and wantonly wasted in enjoying worldly pleasures, in hugging shadows and clasping illusions, and indulging in forbidden pursuits.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">Delusion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though without beginning, delusion has an end. JÛāna or saving knowledge is not something which has to be attained or striven for, for the soul (Atmā) is the very embodiment of JÛāna. Efforts and exertion are necessary only for attaining something which is unrealized. In this case, however, we have only to dispel the ignorance through which we have assumed Brahma (the Eternal Principle), which is always with us, as something unrealized. Really speaking, this ignorance does not subsist in Brahma. It exists in him alone who looks upon this transitory world as something eternal. As a matter of fact, since there is no delusion with Brahma, it is equally preposterous to attempt to dispel it. But so long as the delusion exists it is necessary to get rid of it, and more so on the part of those who labour under this delusion. Delusion has existed since time without beginning in the eyes of those who recognize. It is alleged that a thing which has existed since time without beginning has no end. This is, however, not correct; for an error must cease; if there is an error, it must. If on the other hand, it is held that error is without an end, it would not be possible for any one attain knowledge. Hence it will have to be admitted that though delusion is without beginning, it must have an end. If it is held that the error has not existed since time without beginning, and came into existence of a later stage, three anomalies arise. In the first place, those who have attained (knowledge) will be liable to fall into error again. Secondly, it exposes God, the Creator of the universe, to blame, and thirdly, it keeps the door open for new creatures to come into existence. In this way delusion is proved to have an end, though without a beginning. As a matter of fact, conception of time, too, exists within the four walls of Māyā (Illusion). Brahma is absolute and beyond time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">The Vedas, other scriptures and the enlightened souls also declare that there is nothing except Brahma, the Oversoul, consisting of pure intelligence. It does not lie in the mouth of anyone to say that the world is unreal, for such an assertion is not possible. To hold the world as unreal would be negating God, the Creator of the universe, the scriptures laying down what one should do and what one is forbidden to do, this and the other world, virtue and vice and so on. And to pronounce or hold these as meaningless is something beyond our competence. In that transcendental state where nothing but the Absolute exists, one gets tongue-tied. Speech functions only where there is ignorance and on that plane God, the Creator, the universe, the scriptures and everything is real and it behoves us all, so long as we are on this plane, to recognize all these as real and to act in accordance with the teachings of the scriptures. The delusion disappears as soon as the heart gets purified through the practice of virtuous deeds and motiveless devotion to God, and the aspirant attains his goal. This is what we call God-realization.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">Dispassion</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Value of Dispassion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dispassion (Vairāgya) is highly essential for the seeker of final beatitude. The soul can be free only through Vairāgya. True Vairāgya gives rise to indifference towards worldly attachments or possessions and through this indifference alone one is able to meditate upon the essential form of the Divine. Real knowledge of the Divine follows in the wake of true meditation and knowledge is the gate to liberation. Mukti or final liberation from the bondage of births and deaths is impossible for them who do not realize the importance of JÛāna and non-attachment as essential steps to the absolution of the soul from metempsychosis. The knowledge which is bereft of dispassion and non-attachment is no knowledge, that is merely verbal knowledge or book-knowledge, which is the cause of bondage and never of liberation. The śruti says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्धं तम: प्रविशन्ति येऽविद्यामुपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ततो भूय इव ते तमो य उ विद्यायाॸरता:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(ºśopaniṣad 9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“They enter the dark region who have given themselves up to Ignorance; the darker region enter they who devote themselves to knowledge alone.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such verbal JÛānīs take a headlong plunge in sensual enjoyments. They do not take sin to be sin and hence it is that they fall into the clutches of Māyā and are lost forever. Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa has well said regarding such people:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Without knowing the Real Self one who has relinquished his legitimate duties—such a soul, says Tulasī, will straight go down to hell.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* ब्रह्मग्यान उपज्यो नहीं कर्म दिये छिटकाय।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5"> तुलसी ऐसी आतमा सहज नरक महँ जाय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In fact, people are prone to embrace ignorance in the name of JÛāna. Hence an earnest seeker after true happiness should make it a point to acquire true and unshakable Vairāgya. Vairāgya does not consist in adopting a particular garb. To forsake one’s wife, children, family, wealth, etc., on any account, to put on clothes dyed in ochre, to remove the hair or to keep matted hair, and so on, which are supposed to be emblems of Vairāgya, do not constitute real Vairāgya. To put up a show of Vairāgya outwardly and to indulge in sensuous enjoyments mentally is what is called hypocrisy. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थान् विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचार: स उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-18">Gītā</span> III. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who outwardly restraining the organs of sense and action, sits mentally dwelling on objects of senses, the man of deluded intellect is called a hypocrite.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hypocrisy is fast gaining ground today. There are people who take a rigid vow of silence simply with a view to deceiving others; others fix themselves up in a particular pose to serve their selfish ends; there are still others who besmear their bodies with ashes. Again, some grow long hair on their heads, while others are always found sitting by the fire—all this simply to fill their belly—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘</span><span class="char-style-override-19">उदरनिमित्तं बहुकृत वेश:</span><span class="char-style-override-7">’.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None of these external forms can be said to constitute Vairāgya. This should never be taken to mean that I discourage the practice of renouncing one’s wife and progeny, family, possession, sacred thread, bunch of hair on the head, etc., or bodily relinquishing one’s legitimate duties. Nor do I call the vow of silence, adopting a particular pose, besmearing the body with ashes, growing long hair on the head or removing it altogether, as unscriptural or reproachable. Nor, again, do I suggest that all those who have left their hearths and homes and adopted these emblems are hypocrites. Nothing is farther from my intention than to revile or hold in contempt any person or class. I have in view those persons alone who put on appearances in the name of Vairāgya, simply with a view to eliciting homage from the masses and imposing upon them. Those sincere seekers of the divine light who take to external garbs mentioned above simply as an aid to self-control, and as a means of purifying the self and pushing their Sādhanā, are by no means to be condemned to looked down upon. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, too, has characterized as hypocrites only those who put up a show of self-control but inwardly dwell upon sensuous objects. Those people who renounce sense-enjoyments mentally as well as bodily, in a spirit of true Vairāgya and with their mind fixed on the Lord, have been admired and eulogized in all the scriptures.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vairāgya is really a great mystery and those alone who have acquired real dispassion know the secret of it. Vairāgya in its highest form is to be found only in those God-attained soul who are liberated even though endowed with a body—have dived deep into the ocean of divinity and have lost all relish for sense-enjoyments. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa has said in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">रसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 59)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Sense-objects cease for him, who does not enjoy them with his senses; but the taste for them persists. This relish also, disappears in the case of the man of stable mind when he sees the Supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Let us now examine the true nature of Vairāgya, ways to attain it, the distinguishing marks of those who are altogether free from attachment and the fruit of Vairāgya. For one who is practising Vairāgya can be classified under two heads; they have been called by the names of Vairāgya and unshakable Vairāgya <span class="char-style-override-7">(दृढ़ वैराग्य)</span> in the Gītā, Vairāgya and ultimate Vairāgya<span class="char-style-override-7"> (पर वैराग्य)</span> in the “Yoga-Sµutras” and as Vairāgya and indifference (<span class="char-style-override-7">उपरति)</span> in works on Vedānta. Although there is a shade of difference in the significance of the three sets of terms referred to above and the ideals they represent, yet there is close affinity between all these expressions. Here reference has been made to all the three terms simply to hint at the ideal commonly represented by them.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Nature of Vairāgya<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The commentators on the “Yoga-Sµutras” have classified Vairāgya under four heads, viz., <span class="char-style-override-7">यतमान, व्यतिरेक, एकेन्द्रिय</span> and <span class="char-style-override-7">वशीकार</span> and explained them at length. Their exposition is by all means reasonable and commendable. We shall endeavour in the following lines to point out in brief, according to our own poor lights, the true nature of Vairāgya in such a way as to make it easily intelligible to all.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Vairāgya Arising from Fear<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Enjoyment of worldly pleasures will eventually lead to perdition. For, enjoyment implies acquisition of enjoyable objects, which in its turn entails exertion. Every exertion, again, involves the commission of sins and the result of sin is perdition or misery. Thus, withdrawing from sensual enjoyments from fear of pain, taking the means of enjoyment to be productive of misery, is what may be called Vairāgya through fear.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Vairāgya Through Discrimination<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Objects which are supposed to have the power of gratifying the senses and thus bringing about delight, and the acquisition of which appears to give pleasure, are really speaking, not enjoyable, nor can they bring happiness, nor again there is happiness in them. Out of sheer folly we have wrongly assumed objects full of misery, nay misery itself, to be happiness. That is why they appear to us as pleasurable—whereas, in reality, they are pain itself or at best a source of pain and woe. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दु:खयोनय एव ते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आद्यन्तवन्त: कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुध:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā V. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The pleasures which are born of sense-contacts, are verily sources of pain (though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people). They have a beginning and an end (they come and go). Arjuna, it is for this reason that a wise man does not indulge in them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if these sense-enjoyments do not actually appear to us as transitory, they must be regarded as such and endured, says Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदु:खदा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā II. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O son of Kuntī, the contacts between the senses and their objects which give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc., are transitory and fleeting; therefore, Arjuna, endure them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa has put forth the fruit of this endurance in the following verse:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">समदु:खसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā II. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, the wise man to whom pain and pleasure are alike, and who is not tormented by these contacts, becomes eligible for immortality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord proceeds to tell us in unequivocal terms that a thing which is proved by reason to be non-existent does not really exist.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the considered view of philosophers.</p>
<p class="Shlok">नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be; the reality of both has thus been perceived by the seers of truth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vairāgya which is a product of such discrimination may be called “Vairāgya based on deliberation.”</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Vairāgya Through Sādhanā<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a Sādhaka, as a result of regular Sādhanā, begins to experience an ecstasy of Divine love, and the light of Divine wisdom begins to dawn on his mind, his mind is automatically drawn away from all sensuous objects. All sorts of worldly enjoyments now appear to him as obviously painful and consequently a hindrance in the way of God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the eyes of such a Sādhaka, wife and children, etc., who appear so attractive and delightsome to worldly-minded man, are contemptible and agonizing.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> Wealth and possessions, beauty and youth, cars and conveyances, position and dignity, pomp and show, luxury and decoration, all appear to him as a pestilence, and he regards their association as a source of greater bondage and misery and, in fact, more detestable than a stinking dark dungeon. He is as much afraid of honour and praise, regard and respect, as ordinary people are afraid of a lion or a tiger, spirits and genii, or the god of Death himself! He is awfully afraid of visiting a place where there is the remotest chance of his receiving homage, respect or honour. He, therefore, keeps at a respectable distance from such places. Such things as praise and glory, honour and respect, which ordinary people receive with great exultation, make him shy, uncomfortable and miserable, as he regards them as degrading to his soul. He despises honour and praise just as we cannot bear the very sight of unholy and disgusting objects. He does not accept honour or praise even under pressure or to oblige anyone. How can one accept a thing which is disgusting to him?</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">* This should never be taken to mean that wife and children are to be hated and despised in actual practice. A householder who is a seeker of the Divine as well, should treat all with due affection and yet have non-attachment with them at heart.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those people who offer him honour and praise, are in his eyes simple fellows doing harm to him, though having the best of intentions. A foolish friend is sometimes worse than a foe. He does not, therefore, yield to their importunities for their momentary gratification. He knows that while they will not gain anything thereby, it will decidedly tend towards his degradation. His uncompromising attitude, on the other hand, does not expose him to any blame, much less to the charge of violence. Moreover, it is not morally binding on him to yield to their importunities in this matter. Morality or religion is that abiding principle which stand a person in good stead here as well as hereafter. How can that which is prejudicial to one’s secular as well as spiritual interests be blessing to him? That is decidedly not honour but a great calamity. Foolish parents out of blind affection for their little child give it unwholesome food to eat and then feel miserable along with the child.<br/> Similarly, these simple-minded friends, being ignorant of the essence of things, seek to push him on the path of sin. A sensible boy will not yield to the unwholesome importunities of his parents and does not incur any sin thereby. Even parents realizing or visualizing the consequence, do not get angry with him. On considering the pros and cons of the situation even these friends would not take offence. So thinking, he does not accept honour and praise bestowed by anyone. For he knows full well that by accepting these he would be courting ruin. And he is not so self-sacrificing as to ruin himself for the sake of a little gratification of others. Even if he had such a spirit of self-sacrifice, prudence would not approve of his sacrificing his highest interests. May the Lord grant wisdom to those innocent people who out of sheer ignorance compel seekers after truth to accept honour and praise, and thus throw them into the abyss of darkness and misery.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This sort of dislike for worldly objects that one acquires through discrimination arising out of Sādhanā, is known as Vairāgya attained through Sādhanā. For one who has acquired this type of Vairāgya, wife and children, power and pelf, honour and praise lose all attraction and lustre, even as the moon appears lustreless and pale when the bright orb of the sun has made its appearance in the eastern horizon.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Vairāgya through the Highest <br/>Knowledge of Brahma<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the aspirant has realized God, he automatically ceases to have any interest in the various objects of the world, as they now appear to him tasteless and illusive. Then he sees no substance in anything except the all-pervading divine principle. Just as water ceases to appear in the mirage as soon as one comes to know that it is mirage; just as to one who has woke up from sleep and recognized the dream to be a dream, the world of the dream ceases to appear as real even when called to mind. Similarly, the worldly objects no longer appear as substantial and real to seer of the essence of things. A beautiful garden conjured up by a clever sorcerer captivates the hearts of all others; but the boy with the magician, who is in the know of the secret, is not led away by it, knowing it to be illusive and false. No doubt, he is immensely delighted to see the Māyā of his Master, who is the controller of that Māyā. Similarly, one who has acquired the type of Vairāgya shown above is not led away by worldly enjoyments. Such a person does not recognize even the existence of any object of sense-enjoyment how, then, can he mistake it to be attractive or delightful. Such a person alone becomes eligible for attaining the highest status of Brahmic bliss. This is the supreme type of Vairāgya or stable Vairāgya, as it is called.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Ways to the Attainment of Vairāgya<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the light of the above exposition, aspirants should in the beginning assume that the objects of worldly enjoyments are ultimately harmful, and renounce them even from fear or disgust, taking them to be painful, nay, pain itself. Thoughts inducing Vairāgya will automatically arise in the mind if we repeatedly conjure up visions of dispassion, ponder on the value of renunciation, consider the real worth of the world, visit or hear tales of dead persons, deserted palaces, dilapidated buildings and ruins of houses and reflect on the fate of departed kings and monarchs and live in the company of persons who have cut off all attachment to the world and are thoughtful and wise. One should extricate the mind from the meshes of wife and children, wealth and possessions, glory and renown, honour and fame, etc., knowing them to be painful and abounding in faults of various kinds. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्‍कार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तिरनभिष्वङ्ग: पुत्रदारगृहादिषु।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XIII. 8-9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Dispassion towards the objects of senses, and absence of egoism, constant revolving in mind of the pain and evil inherent in birth, death, old age and disease; absence of attachment, absence of self-identification with son, wife, home etc.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we just pause a while and take stock of things, we shall find a number of arguments to bring home to us the fact that all worldly objects are painful. There is an aphorism in the “Yoga-Sµutras”, which runs as under:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परिणामतापसंस्कारदु:खैर्गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दु:खमेव सर्वं विवेकिन:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"><span class="char-style-override-20">(II. 15)</span><span class="char-style-override-21"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The wise realize that all sense-enjoyments are full of pain inasmuch as they result in pain, nay, their very presence is painful, as also their memory, and because there was conflicting tendencies in the mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We shall try to explain this more fully in the following few lines.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Pain in consequence:—</span>A pleasure which, though appearing as pleasure in the beginning, turns out to be extremely painful in the end, is said to be painful in consequence. Unwholesome food, which is palatable in the beginning but is ultimately harmful to an ailing person, is an instance in point. Just as an ailing person who is given to sense-gratification, takes a dainty dish which is pleasing to the palate, despite the doctor’s protest and feels miserable, weeps and wails in the end; similarly, sense-enjoyments, though appearing attractive and pleasing in the beginning, are very painful in the end. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विषयेन्द्रियसंयोगाद्यत्तदग्रेऽमृतोपमम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">परिणामे विषमिव तत्सुखं राजसं स्मृतम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XVIII. 38)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The joy which is derived from the contact of the senses with their object, though appearing like nectar in the beginning (at the time of enjoyment), proves to be mischievous like poison in the end. That is why such a joy is said to be Rājasika.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The itching sensation produced in the skin by ringworm is very agreeable in the beginning when the parts affected rubbed by the hand; but the scratches thus made eventually bring about a burning sensation which is very painful. Similar is the case with sense-enjoyments. All sense-enjoyments, whether of this world or of the next, end in pain. People attain heavenly bliss as a result of accumulated merit of series of lives; but they, “having enjoyed the spacious heaven-world, their merit exhausted, come back to this world of death.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">ते तं भुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa, too, strikes a similar note when he says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Sensual enjoyment is not the goal of this human existence. Even heavenly bliss is limited and painful in the end.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* एहि तन कर फल बिषय न भाई।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">स्वर्गउ स्वल्प अंत दुखदाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">The agonizing, nature of sense-enjoyments:</span>—Wife, son, master, wealth and possession and everything else is afflicting and tormenting us at every step. There is not a single object on earth which on careful thought does not appear to be painful. Moreover, when a man finds those around him in a better position, a sense of his limited means makes him envious. There is pain in procuring any object, pain in preserving it, and pain again in losing it. It has been well said:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अर्थानामर्जने दु:खं तथैव परिपालने।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नाशे दु:खं व्यये दु:खं धिगर्थं क्लेशकारिणम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One has to experience a lot of trouble in earning money, and an equal amount of worry in preserving it. Nay, one has always to burn in the fire of anxiety lest the money hoarded by him may be lost. In other words, money torments us when lost or expended and afflicts us when left behind at the time of death. In short, it is troublesome from the beginning to the end. Hence it is that it has been condemned in the above verse. Similar is the case with children, honour and fame. All these things are painful from the time we seek to obtain them till they are lost to us. There is no sensual enjoyment which does not give pain.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Memory of objects also painful</span>:—Objects such as wife, husband, children, family, wealth and honour—all that we have got, leave their impressions on the mind, so that, when they are lost, their absence makes us extremely miserable. “How prosperous I was; how handsome, well-built and obedient was my son; how faithful was my wife; how happy I was during the lifetime of my husband; my fame had spread in all the corners of the world; I was a millionaire; but alas! to what pitiable condition I have been reduced today; I am a penniless and forlorn creature.” Thoughts of this nature torment those who have met with reverses in life. Although there are millions and millions as destitute as he from the very beginning, they are not so miserable as he is. They alone who retain impressions of joy experienced at the time of enjoying sense-objects abundantly miss them when they are no longer present. This is what is meant by the term <span class="char-style-override-7">‘‘संस्कारदु:खता’’.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides this, one thing more should be borne in mind in this connection, viz., that all sense-pleasures of this world are ever associated with pain.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Pain accruing from conflicting propensities of the mind</span>:—Suppose a man expects to get a sum of ten thousand rupees if he takes recourse to falsehood, deceit, duplicity and treachery. The virtuous element in him says, “It is not good to earn money through sin; it is better to beg or even to starve than to take recourse to sinful actions.” The propensity of greed, on the other hand, says, “Where is the harm? What objection can there be in telling a lie only once? An insignificant bit of greed, duplicity or treachery can do you no harm. Avail this unique opportunity to make yourself wealthy and remove the curse of poverty; then you may take a vow not to do so in future.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way there is a regular tussle in his mind between the good and evil propensities, and the mind is tossed hither and thither and agitated, and knows not what to do. There is no end to the agony and perturbation of his mind. Similarly, there are occasions when there is a struggle between the Sāttvika and Tāmasika propensities of a man. Suppose a man is playing at cards or chess. If he does not reach his house in time, his household work is likely to suffer. His Rājasika or active nature, therefore, goads him to leave the game and go to his house, whereas his Tāmasika nature draws him close to the game and does not allow him to leave it. He is thus in a great fix and becomes miserable.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, if we devote some thought to these questions, it will become clear to us that all the so-called enjoyments of this world are nothing but pain. Hence we should try our level best to extricate our mind from their clutches.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These are the ways to acquire dispassion arising from fear or discrimination and are also helpful in attaining the higher type of Vairāgya. The following practices are specially helpful in acquiring the preliminary types of Vairāgya.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By constant remembrance of God and repetition of His names the impurities of the heart are gradually washed away and the heart becomes purer from day to day. When the heart has become pure and stainless, waves of Vairāgya will<span> </span>naturally arise in the mind and the attraction for sense-objects will automatically vanish. At this stage deliberation becomes unnecessary. Just as a mirror is freed from dirt and becomes clearer and clearer as it is rubbed with cotton, even so the mind gets purified and illumined by constant remembrance of and meditation  on the Lord, and the soul from within shines forth all the more brightly through it. In this process of self-purification even the slightest particle of dirt pricks the aspirant like a spike. Hence it is that he applies himself all the more diligently to devotion and meditation in order to wash this blot, and eventually succeeds in obliterating it. As the heart of the aspirant gets purer and purer by constant devotion and meditation he is inspired with new hopes and strength. The remembrance of and meditation on the Lord, are boring to him alone who does not know their real worth. One who has begun to understand their true worth, will experience greater and greater bliss gradually and will proceed with greater enthusiasm on his Godward march in order to attain perfect bliss. Sensual enjoyments lose their very entity in his eyes. He thereby attains stable Vairāgya in no time. It is with the axe of this solid Vairāgya that the Lord has asked us to cut down the tree of worldliness with its firm roots of ego, meum and desire.</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 62)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Seek refuge in Him alone with all your being, Arjuna. Through His grace you shall obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Enjoyment of everlasting bliss is the ultimate goal of human existence, and God alone is the abode of everlasting bliss; hence God-realization is the sole object of human life. A number of ways and means for the realization of this end have been suggested by our sages and saints for the various types and grades of aspirants. But on careful consideration it would appear that none of them is so simple, easy and convenient as surrendering oneself to God. That is why it has been extolled in almost all the scriptures. śrīmad Bhagavadgītā, for one, begins with surrender and also ends with surrender. The discourse of the Lord commences only after Arjuna addresses the following entreaty to Him:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am Your disciple—Pray instruct me, who have sought refuge in You.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">And He concludes the same with the following exhortation:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 66)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone, I shall absolve you of all sins; grieve not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even in the preceding verses the Lord has stressed the importance of this discipline more than anything else. However degraded one may be by birth or by virtue of his conduct, and however involved in sin, he can easily attain the supreme goal by merely surrendering himself to God. The Lord says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्यु: पापयोनय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम्॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, womanfolk, VaiÜyas (members of the trading class), śµudras (those belonging to the labouring class), and even those that are born of the womb of sin (such as the pariah), taking refuge in Me, they too attain the supreme goal.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The śruti also says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्धॺेवाक्षरं ब्रह्म एतद्धॺेवाक्षरं परम्।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“It is this Indestructible Principle which is all-pervading, it is the Supreme Entity; it is by knowing this principle that one is enabled to realize the fruit of one’s desires. Dependence on this principle is of supreme importance, it excels all other dependence. One who has realized this, is adored even in the abode of Brahmā, the Creator.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sage PataÛjali also declares it to be the easiest method of attaining Samādhi (absorption in God), when he says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद्वा।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yoga-Sµutras I. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“(One can attain Samādhi) even by surrendering oneself to God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">PataÛjali further goes to describe the result of it as follows:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत: प्रत्यक्चेतनाधिगमोऽप्यन्तरायाभावश्च।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yoga-Sµutras I. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>“Surrender to God ultimately leads to His realization and the disappearance of all obstacles.”</span><span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord śrī Rāma, too, has made the following reassuring proclamation:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो ददाम्येतद्‍व्रतं मम॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I rid him of all fears who betakes himself to Me only once and seeks My protection, calling himself as Mine—this is my vow.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above questions should suffice to give an indication of the volumes of praise that the śāstras have bestowed on surrender to God, which it is impossible to reproduce within the space of a few pages. Now let us consider what is meant by Surrender. Surrender  does not consist in betaking oneself to the Lord only verbally. Surrender ordinarily means wholly dedicating one’s mind, speech and body to the Lord; but such an act of surrender is not accomplished by simply repeating the formula <span class="char-style-override-15">‘श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु’</span>  (I offer this to Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa), however well-meaning the assertion may be. Had this assertion alone constituted the act of surrender, an untold number of God-dedicated persons would be available everywhere and must have existed in the past. It is therefore necessary to understand what is meant by dedication.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Total and exclusive surrender to God consists in:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(a) exclusive dependence on God;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(b) recognizing God alone as one’s greatest refuge, one’s ultimate resort, nay, one’s everything;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(c) relinquishing shame, fear, pride, love of praise and attachment and giving up the sense of identity with one’s body and the feeling of meum of mineness in respect of one’s worldly possessions;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d) constantly remembering the appellations, virtues and glories of the Lord and meditating on His Being;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>(e) selflessly discharging one’s duties as enjoined by the Lord for the sake of the Lord Himself and thinking of Him </span><span>all the time.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The following four principal items require to be grasped by an aspirant wh<span>o seeks to surrender himself to the Lord:—</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) to dedicate one’s all to God, taking it to be His property;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) to remain perfectly contented with what has been ordained by Him;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) to discharge one’s duties as enjoined by Him, for His sake; and</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) to think of Him as a matter of course at all times without interruption.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now we shall deal with each one of these items at some length:—</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Dedication of  Everything<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dedication of one’s all to God does not mean that one should leave one’s home and take to the life of a recluse, or that one should shirk one’s legitimate duties and become indolent and inactive. To withdraw the feeling of mineness that one wrongly entertains in respect of things mundane, may be taken as making over that which really belongs to Him. In fact, everything belongs to Him; nay we are very often robbed of what we call our own and thus made to realize that they are not ours; but we in our ignorance are led to regard them as our own and that is why we bewail their loss when we are forced to part with them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Let us take the case of a wealthy merchant who owns a big concern and has placed it in the charge of a manager. Believing him to be honest and dutiful, the merchant has given to his manager the entire charge of looking after his property, conducting the business and carrying on all other transactions regularly on his behalf. Now, the duty of the manager is to do all that is required of him in accordance with the instructions of his master and the procedure laid down by him with great efficiency, care and honesty and without ever claiming anything belonging to his master, as his own or entertaining even for a moment the feeling of meum in respect of the same and without asserting his own individuality. He may have to deal in millions, exercise control over millions worth of property like the proprietor himself, sign bills, cheques and other documents on behalf of the proprietor and do all such things; but <br/>nevertheless he should not recognize anything belonging to the firm as his own. The capital invested belongs to the proprietor, the profits accruing from the business are also his, and so is the liability for losses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Should the manager through mistake, neglect or dishonestly ever seek or embezzle a part of his master’s money, taking it to be his own, or misappropriate his property or the profits that have accrued to him, he is held guilty of dishonesty and theft. On being sued in a court of law he is dispossessed of the property thus misappropriated, is awarded a severe punishment which leaves an indelible blot on his character, is discredited in society and becomes miserable for all time to come. Similarly, if he shirks his responsibilities even after taking charge of his master’s business and violates the rules laid down for him, he is likewise to blame. Hence both these practices are forbidden for a manager.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In a like manner the whole of this universe belongs to God. He is the Creator of all objects, the Controller, the Supporter and the Lord. He has endowed us with a body and placed us in circumstances which we deserved according to our past actions, and enjoined upon us the duty of looking after a definite number of objects belonging to Him and also chalked out the line of action to be followed by us. But we unfortunate beings have erroneously assumed ownership over things belonging to Him, and that is why we have to undergo such miseries. Should we manage to tear the veil of this delusion and come to realize that everything belongs to God; that we are only His servants, and that our only duty is to serve Him, our Divine Master will recognize us to be honest and will be pleased to shower His favours and blessings on us. Liberation from the bonds of Māyā, Illusion, is the greatest blessing for us, ignorant beings. As soon as we realize that everything that exists belongs to God, we shall be rid of the spell of mineness. And the feeling that all that exists is nothing but God, will destroy our egoism. In other words, as soon as we realize that God alone is both the material and the efficient cause of the universe, the feeling of “I” and “mine” in respect of the same will disappear. The feeling of “I” and “mine” alone constitutes bondage. The devotee who had dedicated himself to God is freed from the bondage of  “I” and “mine” and comes to realize that God alone exists and that everything belongs to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This constitutes what is known as dedication. As soon as an aspirant dedicates himself to God in this way he is freed from all bondage and rid of all worries. He who is given to worrying, he who feels himself bound and seeks freedom from bondage, has not been able to comprehend the Divine Reality, nor has he surrendered himself to God. An aspirant who treads the path of surrender no longer worries himself for his salvation. This is quite natural. For, if a man worries even after he has dedicated himself to God, his surrender has no meaning. He is looked after by his master to whom he has surrendered himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A Hindi poet says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जो जाको सरणो लियो ता कहँ ताकी लाज।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उलटे जल मछली चलै बह्यो जात गजराज॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who has dedicated himself to someone else, is secure in the arms of the latter. A fish, for instance, is able to swim even against the current because of its dependence on water, whereas an elephant who relies on his own strength is swept along the stream.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If King śivi out of generosity and compassion could protect a pigeon seeking shelter from him, even by parting with his own flesh, will that supreme Lord who is the protector of the helpless and an illimitable and unfathomable ocean of compassion, and in comparison with whose unbounded love for those who seek shelter from Him, the loftiest instance of tenderness in the world’s history, pales into insignificance, fail to extend His protecting hand to us and to redeem us on our betaking ourselves to Him? If we continue to worry about our salvation even then, and at the same time consider ourselves to be God-dedicated, it is something very mean of us; this shows we have not been able to understand the real meaning of surrender. As a matter of fact, it is immaterial for a God-dedicated devotee whether he is redeemed or not. Surrendering himself along with his mind and intellect t His feet, he becomes altogether free from anxiety. Why, then, should he care for his salvation? Far from worrying about his salvation, a devotee who has grasped the real meaning of surrender does not like even to recall the topic. If the Lord Himself ever broaches the subject to him, he feels that his surrender is not complete and is therefore, very much ashamed and begins to reproach himself. He realizes that had there been no desire of liberation lurking somewhere in his mind, he would not have had to face that unpleasant situation. In fact, liberation is nothing as compared to Divine Love, and it is a matter of great shame to seek liberation in preference to the latter. He would, therefore, feel that the desire of liberation was a blot on his surrender and, realizing his own frailty and meanness and his lack of faith in God, would burst into tears and address the following piteous appeal to the Lord in solitude:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O my Lord! so long as the desire of liberation lingers in my heart, how can I claim to be Thy servant? Nay, I am a slave of liberation. I covet something other than Thyself, serve Thee for the sake of liberation, and yet consider myself to be Thy disinterested lover and dedicated to Thee. This is nothing short of hypocrisy on my part. Pray stamp out this evil. Nay, I beseech Thee to banish from my heart the selfish desire of liberation and to be pleased to bestow on me Thy undivided love. It is sheer childishness on my part to ask for anything from one who is all-mercy and unparalleled in everything; but you know, my Lord, one who is in distress does not scruple to do anything.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way a God-dedicated devotee surrenders his all at the lotus-like feet of the Lord and becomes free from all anxiety.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Contentment with Everything <br/>Ordained by the Lord</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One who has attained this stage remains cheerful in every circumstance. Gain or loss, pleasure or pain, whatever comes to his lot as a consequence of his past actions, whether brought about by the will of someone else or by accident, he welcomes as a merciful dispensation of Providence and remains uniformly cheerful, unruffled and calm under every circumstance. The Gītā says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदृच्छालाभसंतुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सर:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सम: सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IV. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He, who is contented with whatever is got unsought, is free from jealousy and has transcended all pairs of opposites (like joy and grief), and as balanced in success and failure—such a Karmayogī, though acting, is not bound.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>A God-dedicated devotee really knows that whatever </span>comes to his lot as a matter of course, accrues to him by divine dispensation which is full of equity and mercy. He therefore accepts it cheerfully and with a grateful heart as a boon conferred by his most benevolent Lord. Just as one gladly accepts the award given by a loving friend of his, whom he knows to be impartial and just, even though it is unfavourable to him; relying on the latter’s sense of justice, discretion, thoughtfulness, benevolence, impartiality and love, so does a God-dedicated devotee cheerfully and reverently accept the divine dispensation, however unpleasant it may be. For he knows that whatever is ordained by his benevolent Lord, who is absolutely merciful, is impregnated with mercy, love, justice and benevolence. He never grudges any decree of Providence whatsoever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At times the Lord puts His dedicated devotees to severe tests. Although He knows everything belonging to the past, present and the future, and there is nothing concealed from His view, He indulges in His Divine Sport of testing the devotion of His devotee, in order to purge his heart of all impurities in the shape of pride, arrogance, infatuation and so on and to make it transparent, and to fortify him against all evil influences and thus to do him lasting good. Such lovers of God as have understood the real meaning of surrender, never feel anything disagreeable to their mind. No movement of a juggler ever strikes his mate as disagreeable or unpleasant. The latter makes himself subservient to the former’s will and submits to every activity of his most cheerfully. A devotee, likewise, cheerfully joins every sport of the Lord. He knows that whatever he sees around him is nothing but a sport of his Lord, who is a unique player indulging in sports of various kinds. He feels that the Lord is extremely kind to him in so far as He has associated him in His sport and regards himself very fortunate in having been chosen by the Lord as an instrument to assist Him in His Divine Play(Līlā). Realizing this, he visualizes the Lord’s adroitness in every game of His; nay, he perceives the Lord Himself concealed behind it and is transported with joy at every moment. The above account relates to that class of devotees who have absolutely surrendered themselves to the Lord. Nay, even one who is practising surrender takes every piece of fortune and misfortune to be His merciful dispensation and rejoices in it. Now one may pertinently ask: It is quite natural and in the fitness of things that one rejoices when he meets with a piece of good fortune; but how is it possible to rejoice in adversity just as in happiness? Our reply is that in the eyes of one who has realized the Divine Principle even the gratification and solace derived from earthly enjoyment, are symptoms of morbidity. He transcends both pleasure and pain arising from favourable and unfavourable objects and resulting from meritorious and sinful acts respectively. Even one who is on the road to this consummation must feel cheerful at least. Just as a wise patient, who is suffering from a serious disease, gladly takes a bitter dose administered by a clever doctor and feels grateful to him, even so one should cheerfully endure hardships inflicted by God who is an extremely benevolent, unselfish and unerring doctor, and should rejoice and feel indebted to Him for His benevolence and mercy. A loving devotee who has dedicated himself to God endures, great hardships most cheerfully and rejoices at every moment, recalling His kindness. He realizes that just as a benevolent doctor cures his patient by cutting his festering sore and removing all putrescent matter therefrom, so does the Lord sometimes apply the knife of hardships to His patients with an eye to their welfare and cures them. His provision is full of mercy. Realizing this, the devotee remains contented with every decree of Providence. He is not perturbed amidst troubles and does not covet pleasures.</p>
<p class="Shlok">दु:खेष्वनुद्विग्नमना: सुखेषु विगतस्पृह:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā II. 56)</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Acting in Accordance with the <br/>Injunctions of the Lord </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, having no desire left in him for the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, a devotee can never commit a forbidden act out of attachment or from a selfish motive. Every activity of his is in conformity with the injunctions of the Lord. None of his actions ever goes against His will. For he has merged his own will in that of the Lord, he has no independent will of his own. Even an ordinary faithful servant does not want to do anything contrary to his master’s wishes; and, if he ever does so through some <br/>mistake, he feels ashamed of it and is filled with remorse for the same. Much less would a faithful devotee who has dedicated himself to God out of pure love do anything against His will. Just as a virtuous lady who is devoted to her husband, always acts in accordance with the wishes of her most beloved husband and follows him like a shadow, in the same way a loving devotee who had dedicated himself to God follows the Divine Will and does everything for Him, taking everything to be His.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now it may be asked: When God is not manifest to all, how are we to know His wishes or commands? Our reply to this is that in the first place, the scriptures embody His commandments, so to say; for the ancient seers, who were devotees of God and possessed knowledge of the past, present and the future, wrote them mostly in accordance with His view. Secondly, works like the Bhagavadgītā contain His direct commands. Thirdly, the Lord, being omnipresent and the inner controller of all, dwells in the hearts of all living beings. Man generally receives proper guidance if he consults Him within his heart with an unbiased mind and with a genuine desire to have his doubts removed. Nobody’s conscience honestly sanctions the practice of untruthfulness, theft or violence. Here lies the clue to the Divine Will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we get a doubtful reply from our conscience to any of our queries, due to our intellect being clouded by a thick coating of ignorance, and are accordingly unable to decide upon a particular course of action, we should seek the advice of such men as are unselfish, virtuous and conversant with the principles of Ethics. It is profitable to consult worthy souls even on points about which we have no doubts in our mind. For so long as one has not realized God one is liable to mistake untruth for truth. Hence one should do well to have one’s judgment confirmed by the opinion of the wise. As one’s heart gets purified one begins to comprehend the Divine will rightly. Thenceforward whatever the aspirant does is mostly in consonance with His Will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is generally observed that a faithful servant who always acts in accordance with his master’s wishes, is able to read the latter’s mind on receiving the slightest indication from him. When such is the case with ordinary people, what wonder if a God-dedicated devotee begins to know His will through piety, faith and love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is one more criterion of judging the Divine will. It must be understood at the very outset that God is all-wise, friendly to all, an ocean of mercy, the Inner Self of all and engaged in doing good to all. Hence He can never countenance an act which may in anyway be prejudicial to the best interests of any living being whatsoever. Accordingly, such an act alone is in conformity with the Divine will as is really conducive to the welfare of others; and, on the contrary, that which is harmful to others is something contrary to His will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are some who in their ignorance recognize it as an article of their faith to harm others or inflict bodily injury on them, declaring that it has been sanctioned by their scriptures and religion. This is, however, an erroneous belief. It can never be the intention of God or religion that one should harm others or practise violence on others. Of course, punishing someone with an eye to his welfare, just as the parents punish their child or a teacher punishes his pupil, is a different thing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus every activity of a devotee is in conformity with the Divine will, so that he can never commit a sinful or forbidden act. Every dealing of his is naturally straightforward, pure and conducive to public good; for he has no selfish interest in the world, no attachment with anything, no fear.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Not to speak of a God-dedicated devotee, fear and sin forsake even those who really believe in the existence of God. A king or his officials are not bodily present in a lonely retreat at night time; but the very existence of a Government deters people from committing unlawful acts. It is even much more difficult to violate a law in the presence of a Government official. When such is the awe inspired by an earthly Government, how can one who perceives the existence of the Almighty Lord everywhere commit a sin in His august and sacred presence? The all-pervasiveness of God proves that He is present everywhere. Hence one who subscribes to the above view can have no fear. For, when even the presence of a single Government official takes away all fear of thieves, what fear can there be for one who is always and everywhere accompanied by the Lord of the universe? Those who indulge in sinful acts, even though proclaiming themselves devotees, or are haunted by fear of death and other things every moment, do not in reality, believe in the existence of God. Those who believe in God are always free from sin and are fearless.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Constant Remembrance of the Lord<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>The only thing a God-dedicated devotee is afraid of, is forgetting his most beloved Lord. In fact, he </span>can never forget Him; for even a moment’s mental separation from the Lord becomes unbearable to him. It becomes his second nature to remember the Lord constantly, having dedicated all his actions to Him, and to feel extremely uneasy like a serpent robbed of its gem or a fish taken out of water, when put out of mind of the Lord:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तदर्पिताखिलाचारता तद्विस्मरणे परमव्याकुलता।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Nārada-Sµutras)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is the essence of his life, his highest riches, his greatest refuge, his final resort and his ultimate goal. And to think of His names and virtues at every moment, to forget himself in His love, to lose consciousness of the outside world and get intoxicated with love, and to dance in ecstasy becomes his daily routine.</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्वचिद्रुदन्त्यच्युतचिन्तया क्वचि-</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“These blessed devotees sometimes weep in loving memory of the Lord, sometimes they laugh, sometimes rejoice, sometimes they talk marvellous things, sometimes they dance, sometimes they sing, sometimes they imitate the behaviour of the Lord (who is unborn) and sometimes they sit calm and quiet, enjoying Supreme Bliss.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, having realized the secret of surrender of God these devotees become one with the Lord.</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्बुद्धयस्तदात्मानस्तन्निष्ठास्तत्परायणा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">गच्छन्त्यपुनरावृत्तिं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā V. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Those whose mind and intellect are wholly merged in Him, who are constantly established in identity with Him, and are exclusively devoted to Him, their sins being wiped out by wisdom, go to whence there is no return.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is with regard to such people that the Lord has made the following statements:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VII. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For extremely dear am I to the wise man (who knows Me in reality), and he is extremely dear to Me.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am never out of sight of him, nor is he ever out of sight of Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever such a man does through his body is not reckoned as ‘action’ in the ordinary sense of the term. Absorbed in ecstasy, that God-dedicated devotee only imitates the blissful activities of the sportive Lord. Hence his actions, too, are of the nature of sport. The Lord says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 31)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who, established in unity, worships Me as residing in all beings (as their very Self), that Yogī, though engaged in all forms of activities dwells in Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence he treats everyone as his own self, there is no possibility of harm accruing from him to anyone. Of such God-dedicated, God-identified souls, who behold their own self projected everywhere, there are some of the type of śrī śukadeva, who move about in this world as one quite indifferent to its working and with a view to redeeming humanity; there are others of the type of Arjuna who mould their conduct in accordance with the injunctions of the Lord and are engaged in performing their legitimate duties, with their mind always fixed on Him; there are still others of the type of the God-intoxicated cowherd-maids of revered memory, who remain absorbed in ecstasy of Divine Love; while there is a fourth class of blessed beings who conduct themselves in this world as stupid and insane persons like the famous JaÎa Bharata.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Themselves liberated, such God-dedicated devotees turn out to be the saviours of the world. The very sight and touch of these exalted souls, and conversing with them, nay, their every thought has a sanctifying effect. The very atmosphere of the place they visit is purified, and the part of the earth they frequent, becomes sacred and is turned into a place of pilgrimage. The coming into this world of such souls only is worth while, and it is of such noble souls that the following remarks hold good:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कुलं पवित्रं जननी कृतार्था</p>
<p class="Shlok">वसुन्धरा पुण्यवती च तेन।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">“The family of that noble soul is sanctified, his mother is blessed, nay, the whole earth is full of merit in so far as it bears him on its bosom—whose mind has merged in the Supreme Being who is an ocean of limitless knowledge and bliss.”<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 62, 66)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Seek refuge in Him alone with all your being, Arjuna. Through His grace you shall obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode.” “Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone. I shall absolve you of all sins; grieve not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In response to the above summons of the Lord let us all take refuge in Him. Exclusive surrender to the Lord briefly consists in shaking off bashfulness and fear, turning one’s back on honour and praise, and renouncing attachment and the feeling of I-ness and My-ness in respect of one’s body and the world outside; recognizing God alone as one’s supreme shelter and final goal, nay, one’s all-in-all, and constantly dwelling with undivided attention upon His Name, virtues, power and nature with supreme devotion, reverence and love, discharging one’s legitimate duties in a perfectly disinterested way as a behest from the Lord and for the sake of the Lord, and with one’s mind always fixed on Him, and keeping one’s mind well-balanced in pleasure and pain, taking both as a blessing from God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dwelling on the real nature of God in one’s mind, comprehending with one’s intellect the supreme truth that all that exists, is nothing but God; repeating the Divine name with one’s breath (Prāṇa); hearing with reverence the glorification of the virtues, powers and characteristics of the Lord with one’s ears; beholding the images of the Lord and the sacred persons of His loving devotees with one’s eyes; recounting His glories and virtues and chanting His holy name with one’s tongue; and performing disinterested service to the Lord Himself and His devotees with one’s body—all these are included in the act of surrender. It is by thus devoting oneself to His service that one is blessed with Divine love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Everything in this world that we call our own really belongs to God. One foolishly arrogates their ownership to himself and thereby feels happy or miserable. All that is God’s should be made to serve His purpose. One should rejoice in both cases—even if all worldly objects are reduced to dust so as to be able to serve His purpose, or if they remain intact for lending themselves to His use. No one should commit the mistake of looking upon worldly things as one’s own property nor should anyone regard them as something to be enjoyed by himself. For, as we have said before, everything in reality belongs to God; hence one should always conduct himself in the world with this feeling that he is dedicating to God what, in fact, belongs to Him. Such a behaviour will ultimately enable him to attain what is known as surrender to God and which is only another name for Divine love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way, whatever we do should be done as an act of offering to God. This is what they call <span class="char-style-override-7">‘अर्पण’</span> or consecration. Whatever is happening is happening under His dispensation; it is the will of the sportive Lord that is responsible for all this sport. One should not fall a victim to vain rationalization in this connection. Let us merge our will into His and dedicate our life to Him with all our being. When we have thus consecrated our very life to Him and when everyone of our actions will be turned into an offering to the Lord, then alone we should think that we have secured an iota of Divine love, that we are on the way to Self-surrender.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Once we have fully surrendered ourselves to the Lord, nothing remains but the Lord Himself who is all-truth, all-intelligence and all-bliss. That Supreme Being, who is limitless, unthinkable, perfect and all-pervading, fills all space as a compact and endless mass of bliss. This bliss should never be lost sight of. Merging oneself in the all-blissful Lord, one should become all-blissful himself. Whatever meets the eye, wherever it appears and to whomsoever it appears, all is God and God alone. As a matter of fact, the all-blissful Lord lends Himself to the knowledge of no one else but Himself. This in reality constitutes what they call Exclusive Surrender.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-17">Offering of Self to God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The subject of self-offering to God should be critically analysed and examined. The word ‘self’ here means all the three bodies<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> of men together with the soul, and offering means surrender. The things over which we exercise our right of proprietorship, to offer them all unreservedly to God, is self-offering. This is one of the principal items of surrender to God. It may also be described as an essential item of Devotion. There are four states or phases of surrender. The first stage is marked by clinging to God’s Name or His transcendent Form. The second stage is characterized by subordinating one’s will to God, that is, acting in conformity with His will or doing as He may direct him to do. The third phase of surrender consists in cheerfully accepting all the divine decrees; and the fourth stage is that of absolute surrender in which one commits himself to the loving care of God, and surrenders his whole being, his very ‘I’, to God. When ‘I’ myself stand offered to God, all that I possess naturally becomes His property.</p>
<p class="Footnotes">* The three bodies of men are the physical, subtle  and causal bodies.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of the nine stages of Devotion, self-offering represents the final stage. If it is asked where lies the difference between the attitude of a servant towards his master and that of self-offering, it may be answered that apparently there lies no difference, in as much as the devotee who adopts the attitude of a servant of God, will offer himself to God, in the final stage, and the devotee who has offered his self to God, is also a servant of God. But nevertheless the difference between the two positions may be brought out by the following illustration. There are two clerks working in a business firm; they hold all the assets and liabilities as well as the property of the firm to belong to the master of the firm. But whereas one of them <span>takes in return for his services what is barely necessary for his maintenance, viz., food and clothing, the other in addition to this draws a monthly salary as well. While the latter expects something in return for his services, the attitude of the former is absolutely disinterested. The disinterested worker naturally stands at a higher level. Both of them stand in the relation of servant to the firm; but whereas the former  has dedicated his self to the master the latter has not.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In ancient and medieval times there was another class of servants in existence. They were known as slaves or helots. They were born as slaves and died as such. They never received any emoluments for their services and could be given away as dowries. The system is still in vogue in some ancient kingdoms. The surrender of a devotee is even more complete than that of these slaves. In a war between two kings one is vanquished and surrenders himself to the other, addressing the victor he says:—“I am completely at your mercy, you have every right over my person and my kingdom and may do as you like with them. You may either kill me, release me from bondage or even return my kingdom to me.” This is also a form of surrender, but the surrender here is actuated by fear, and not by love or reverence. If the victor king persecutes the vanquished, the latter may feel aggrieved by such treatment, for he has surrendered himself out of a sense of helplessness. Contrary to this, the person who surrenders himself to another out of reverence, devotion and love, will experience a joy even if he is persecuted by the object of his love and devotion. Even slaves feel aggrieved when harassed and persecuted by their master; for the feeling of reverence and love is absent in their surrender. One who offers and surrenders himself through love, reverence and devotion, will not feel aggrieved however much he may be ill-treated. The demon King Bali’s surrender was actuated by love and reverence and not by fear and helplessness. He was warned by his preceptor śukrācārya that the child before him was no ordinary Brāhmaṇa child and that He would strip him of all his possessions, nevertheless, with open eyes and in a spirit of loving devotion Bali offered his all to the Lord. He said to his preceptor, “When it is the Lord Himself who is going to take my all, there can be nothing more delightful to me.” The mind, intellect and body, etc., of the devotee who offers himself to God in a like manner, are no longer his; they now belong to God. He can no longer claim them as his own. Among material objects the puppet may be cited as an illustration of such absolute surrender. The puppet places itself entirely at the disposal of the wire-puller who does whatever he likes with it. He may attire it, make it fight or do anything else with it. It does not do anything on its own initiative. The puppet, however, is an insentient object; it has no consciousness. The person who consciously offers himself to God just as the puppet places itself at the disposal of the wire-puller, automatically develops within himself other phases of surrender as well. I cannot call to mind a better illustration of surrender than the puppet. The juggler’s monkey may also be mentioned in this connection, but it supplies an illustration of obeying the commands of the master. This no doubt is an aspect of surrender, but the main thing is to offer ourselves completely to God. Just as the ownership of a cow which is given over to a priest, is transferred to the priest, one who offers himself to God can no longer exercise any right or authority over himself. A close consideration will show that all things belong to God from the very beginning, and we have wrongly assumed our right of possession over them which should be relinquished. One who realizes this truth remains unperturbed and unshaken under all circumstances. Not only this, he gets absorbed in ecstatic joy; he derives happiness from the happiness of his Master and since his Master is never unhappy, he too is always happy. Whatever he now does he does at the bidding of his Master and in conformity with His wishes; for his mind, intellect and body have been offered to the Lord. Everything now belongs to God, and he no longer exercises his authority over them. Having offered his self to God with devotion, he resigns himself completely to the will of the Lord, so that he never forgets the Paramātmā, and is always immersed in His thoughts.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A devotee who has thrown himself at the mercy of the Lord is sure to attain Him, no matter if he meditates on Him as something apart from him or merges his identity in Him, whether he maintains his separate identity or identifies himself with God. But he has no independent will of his own in the matter. He surrenders all his proprietory right to his Master and will do whatever He bids him do. A devotee who has surrendered himself to God, should never possess a desire <br/>of his own. If any desire ever appears in him, it should be regarded as a defect in his surrender. Yet that is not a vital defect. Did not Bali ask for permission to stay in the lower regions? He did not offer any suggestions of his own accord, but there was no harm in his expressing the desire of his heart when asked by the Lord. He is no doubt a greater devotee who does not accept anything from the Lord, even when He offers it; his, indeed, is a greater surrender than that of Bali. A devotee who has truly surrendered himself to God will address the following words, or something approaching them to the Lord when offered the boon: “O Lord, whom do You offer this boon? Am I not Your own? Do You want to get rid of me by offering this boon? If such is Your desire let it be so, since everything depends on Your will. A father may expel his son from home without giving him a pie, may dismiss him with a paltry hundred or two hundred rupees or make him the master of the whole property. The father asks the son to live apart only when he perceives that the son has a desire to establish himself separately. Otherwise why should he do so? Therefore, O Lord, when You ask me to seek a boon, it is certain that the idea of living apart from You must be lurking somewhere in my mind, else why should You ask me to do so? Surely I must be guilty of misdemeanour and crave Your forgiveness. All that exists in this world belongs to You. If I therefore accept a boon from You, where shall I find a place to keep it apart from You?” This form of surrender can be made even by those who worship God as friend or as their Master. Self-surrender is, therefore, an independent aspect of Bhakti (Devotion). Those who treat the Lord as their friend or Master may adopt this form of Devotion if they choose; and there is no objection if they do not adopt it. It may be argued that friendship will be complete only when there is full surrender to the friend. This is no doubt true; but one can remain a friend even without surrender. The surrender of Vibhīṣaṇa does not appear to be of a very high order. It was the Gopīs who truly surrendered themselves to śrī Kr̥ṣṇa even as friends. They did not regard themselves as independent and treated themselves only as chattel belonging to śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. A devotee may develop all the nine aspects of Devotion or only some of them. One engaged in such forms of Devotion as remembrance of God or meditation, worship or salutation may not surrender himself to God. Of course if one has developed all the other aspects of Devotion, and has not been able to cultivate the spirit of surrender, his Bhakti is no doubt deficient to that extent. One who lacks the spirit of surrender may be a devotee and may be called a devotee, but the glory of a devotee who has made a surrender of himself to God is unique. That is why self-surrender has been recognized as the final stage among the nine different aspects or stages of Devotion. That is the highest form of Devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The first stage of Bhakti is ‘hearing’ (of God’s glory). Without hearing there can be no Bhakti. If any instance of Bhakti without ‘hearing’ comes to notice, past Saṁskāra or association will surely be traceable in that case, which shows that the individual in question must have gone through the process of ‘hearing’ in his previous life. Thus devotion begins. The individual first hears the glory of God and his interest being aroused thereby, he takes to the path of Devotion. Self-offering represents the final stage of Devotion—all other stages are recovered by it. Once self-offering is made, Bhakti becomes exclusive; all the aspects of surrender then manifest themselves of their own accord in the individual. What PataÛjali has described as <span class="char-style-override-7">‘ईश्वरप्रणिधान’</span> (meditation of God) is also achieved, and the fruit of that meditation, viz., attainment of Samādhi (oneness with God) is also realized. He no longer worries about his deliverance, for his deliverance is already an accomplished fact.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee who has surrendered himself to God becomes altogether free from anxiety and care. He is no longer troubled by fear or worry of any sort, whether in relation to this world or to the next. A man of ordinary means who is running a school, troubles himself day and night over thoughts to find the means of conducting the institution. But if a patron possessing sufficient financial strength takes up the work, the former becomes free from all worries. He may now and then attend to that work even now but he no longer feels worried. Similarly, if one goes abroad after entrusting his affairs to a responsible friend or officer, he does not worry about the conduct of his affairs during his absence. Even so, one who has offered himself to God, can have no room for fear and anxiety. On the contrary, his joy will know no bounds. If a millionaire adopts a penniless child as his son, the child will gladly sit on the lap of his adoptive father and leave off all care about his future. He knows that whereas he was a pauper only the other day, he is now heir to property worth crores of rupees. His joy knows no bound now, since his adoption has solved the problem of his food and clothing forever. When such is the joy of a boy who has been adopted by a human father, who can describe the joy of the devotee who has surrendered himself to God? He can have no fear of any sort. When fear leaves the child adopted by even an ordinary man of wealth, how can he who has found shelter in the protecting arms of the Lord, have any fear? One enjoys unbounded and ineffable peace in that state. An adopted child of wealthy father may go to the length of designing against the latter if there is any clash of interests and his own interest is adversely affected; for wealth alone is the pivot of his interest. This will be a height of baseness and ingratitude on his part. No one, however, seeks the protecting arms of the Lord from any selfish motive. He simply rejoices in the fact that  Lord has taken him under His protection. We cannot comprehend the nature of his joy. It is something unique. Suppose the millionaire in question goes to interview the Viceroy accompanied by some of his men including the boy whom he proposes to adopt as his son. Questioned by the Viceroy the boy replies that he is the millionaire’s adopted son, but unless and until the millionaire himself confirms the statement the Viceroy will not accept it. If the boy calls on the Viceroy a second time alone, the Viceroy will refuse to receive him and will insist on his producing a letter from the millionaire inasmuch as the Viceroy knows that it is the boy who says he is the millionaire’s son, the millionaire himself does not acknowledge this fact. Thus the statement of the boy carries no weight. The boy who declares himself as the millionaire’s son does not derive the same pleasure as he does when the millionaire himself acknowledges the fact. Similarly, at present it is we who call ourselves His. But we shall be really His, only when the Lord acknowledges us as His own. Who can describe the joy of the blessed soul whom the Lord takes under His protection? He is actuated by Love and not by any selfish motive. If the father tyrannizes over the adopted son the latter may rebel against the father, because he allows himself to be adopted only out of greed for wealth. But the devotee who offers himself to God through disinterested Love will consider himself blessed even if his body is hacked to pieces. We do not find an apt illustration to describe the condition of this devotee. A visitor approaches a Mahātmā and offers him a piece of cloth. The Mahātmā refuses the offer. Although the visitor makes the offer on his part the gift does not descend to the Mahātmā so long as the latter does not accept it. It descends to the Mahātmā only when at the repeated requests of the visitor the former at last accepts it. He congratulates himself on the Mahātmā having accepted his piece of cloth. When again instead of giving it to his attendants the Mahātmā takes the cloth for his own use how great should be the joy of the giver. Another visitor brings the present of a fan; the day is extremely hot. If the Mahātmā yields to his importunities for being allowed to fan him with his own hands, how great is his joy? The Mahātmā feels inclined to lie down and rest a while. The visitor requests him to place his head on his lap and lie down. If after repeated requests the Mahātmā accepts the offer how great is the joy of the visitor? Now if it be examined whether the object of worship here is a true Mahātmā (great soul) or only a pretender, it will be difficult to ascertain it. It is our high regard for the Mahātmā that gives us such immense joy. Similarly, if God whom innumerable Mahātmās have realized in their lives, condescends to make use of our body or even to hack it to pieces, how great should be our joy? The whole of our body should experience a thrill hitherto unknown. We should deem ourselves blessed if He decided to make a pair of shoes out of the skin of our body and wear it. We should be proud to think that our body is being put to such a use, and shall be filled with gratitude to the Lord. A devoted wife feels happy in the happiness of her husband. She is filled with joy when her husband makes use of the body. Although she worships the husband as the Lord Himself, she knows that he is Nārāyaṇa (God) only to her. Between two intimate friends if the possessions of one are used by another as his own the owner of the articles so used feels highly gratified. All these illustrations have been taken from our ordinary life. Similarly, if God were to make use of our things or of our body, nothing could be a source of greater joy to us. The joy and happiness of the person who thus surrenders himself to God knows no limit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, accompanied by Arjuna and a lion, went to King Mayµuradhwaja in the guise of recluse. He asked for half the body of his son Ratnakumāra for being offered to the lion. The King said he had no objection to this, but it was necessary to consult the Queen as well in the matter. When the Queen too gave her consent, both of them approached the son and wanted to know his pleasure. The Prince readily agreed to the proposal and deemed it a fortune to be of service to the recluse who he knew was none other than God Himself. The King and Queen took the saw in their own hands and began to split the body of the Prince into two. The Prince smiled and beamed with joy; for he knew the recluse to be God Himself. He had reverence and love in his heart and was beaming with joy. The King and the Queen offered their dearest object to God, but Ratnakumāra offered his very self. The King and Queen could not experience the same thrill of joy as the prince did. Observing a tear drop trickle down the cheeks of the Queen, the recluse refused to accept the hospitality of the King. The Queen then explained that she did not lament the death of the son; she regretted that only half the body of the boy came to be of service to the Lord, the other half was not so fortunate. That very instant God revealed Himself before the blessed three. And it was quite natural that He did so. If we can develop the attitude of the Queen, all our possessions will be acceptable to God. Had anyone of the blessed three felt the least regret in the heart, the Lord would not have accepted the offering. An offering should be made with the greatest pleasure. God will manifest Himself the moment we develop the reverence of King Mayµuradhwaja, his Queen and Prince Ratnakumāra. God accepts in His service him alone who offers himself as willingly and cheerfully as Mayµuradhwaja did. He can ill-afford to refuse an offering made with such love as Mayµuradhwaja brought to bear on his offering. Even Mahātmās (great souls) accept, when necessary, a present offered with love. They know that if it is not accepted, the poor soul who makes the offering, will feel disappointed. The Lord on His part has declared in no equivocal terms that He stands pledged to give protection from all creatures to him who surrenders himself only once and seeks His protection.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> Take the illustration of piece of cloth belonging to a particular person: the cloth has surrendered itself to its owner. The owner may tear it to pieces, throw it away, burn it, spread it on the ground, cover himself with it or give it away to someone, it will not murmur: to whatever use the owner may be pleased to put it, it does not raise any objection. Whoever surrenders himself to God like this, will unhesitatingly submit himself to whatever use the Lord makes of him. Such a devotee attains salvation even though living. Although possessing life he <br/>submits to the control of the Lord as though he were dead. He would no more object than a dead body. He alone is a Jīvanmukta (one who is liberated though living) who can, even though living, efficiently play the role of a dead man.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">He who has thus surrendered himself to God, lives only for the good of the people. Just as things which are the common property of a caste or a brotherhood can be used by any member of the brotherhood according to his needs, even so everyone may be said to have a right to derive benefit from that person. Such a person though living for others, will never entertain the idea that he lives and moves for the good of the world, much less will he say so. One who says so in respect to himself is a braggart; he can never be a  liberated soul; virtues like humility, etc., appear in a liberated soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The eyes get sanctified through a sight of such persons, the tongue gets purified through conversing with them and mind gets purified through their thoughts. Thousands and hundreds of thousands of such persons have appeared on the earth from time to time. In the sacred regions of the Himālayas in the extreme north of India many such ¤Rṣis performed their austerities in the past. These sacred spots naturally rouse the spirit of dispassion. One cannot adequately sing the glory of Mahātmās (great souls), who enhance the purity of these spots by their presence. If any boon has to be sought from the Lord, let us pray of him thus: “O Lord, give us strength and wisdom to follow the footsteps of those exalted souls whose glory You Yourself sing.” But what is the need of seeking a boon? One who surrenders himself to God and is accepted by Him can be instrumental in redeeming many souls, to say nothing of his own deliverance. About such souls the Lord says in the Gītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who is alike to friend and foe, and likewise to honour and ignominy, who is alike to heat and cold, pleasure and pain etc., and is free from attachment, he who takes praise and reproach alike, who is given to contemplation and content with whatever comes unasked for, without attachment to home, fixed in mind and full of devotion to Me, that man is dear to me.”<span class="char-style-override-10">* </span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-18">The Duty of Man</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A careful study of the modern mind will make it evident that in the present age people, in general, are in a way opposed to spiritual development. Such men are really few and far between who are in earnest about Self-realization. Even of those few people who strive for it, a large majority know not how to proceed on. Want of faith and devotion has made even real guides rare. Thanks to the times and environment in which we are living and the peculiarity of our nature, some of us are not able to translate our ideas into action in spite of our desire to practise self-discipline. The main cause responsible for this is ignorance combined  with absence of faith in God, the scriptures and the great sages of yore. But nobody can make a gift of this faith or <span class="char-style-override-23">ś</span>raddhā. Association with those possessing this <span class="char-style-override-23">ś</span>raddhā and austerity, sacrifice, charity and worship of God, practised in a disinterested spirit, are some of the means of purifying the heart, and it is only the pure in heart that are blessed  with faith in scriptures and life after death and love for God and God-inspired men. A man is what his <span class="char-style-override-23">ý</span>raddhā is. In this life as well as the next <span class="char-style-override-23">ś</span>raddhā is his only support. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā </span>says :—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्ध: स एव स:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XVII. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, the faith of the each is shaped to his own mental constitution. Faith constitutes the very being of man; therefore, whatever the nature of his faith, that verily he is.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, one should try to acquire true faith.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In whatever name or form of God you repose your faith, you will undoubtedly be considered to have faith in Him; for all names and forms are His. You may repose faith in and follow any religion which appeals to you; any ¡Rṣi, Mahātmā or God-inspired man who is worthy of credence to you. All that is needed is śraddhā or faith. God, religion and life after death etc., or things which can only be believed for the main part. It is after repeated efforts and hard unceasing struggle that one obtain a direct perception of these truths. For the realization of these higher truths one cannot do without reposing faith in someone, at least, in the beginning. If one does not do so, he is sure to turn an atheist and deviate from the path of blessedness. Nay; he will never enter the path of God-realization and will go down in the scale of spiritual evolution.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you do not believe in any particular religion, scripture or the utterances of saints and sages of old, you should certainly believe at least in the teachings of <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmadbhagavadgītā.</span> For the teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> are in harmony with the teachings of almost all the different religions of the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you do not believe even in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>, you should repose faith in God according as you have conceived of Him and, surrendering yourself to Him, apply yourself in right earnest to the work of Self-realization. Supposing you doubt even the existence of God, you should select the best man of the age and arm yourself with sufficient courage to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you cannot repose faith in any saint or great man of the present age, you should pause to consider whether there is no one superior to you in the whole world so far as the knowledge of the path of blessedness is concerned. If you allege that such men do exist but you have not yet come across any such person, it is your duty to find them out; or if you think that there are many people superior to you but people who can ably instruct you in the Law of Higher Life are few and far between and those few who exist are not easily accessible to men lacking in faith and cannot be recognized even if we happen to meet such persons, having not the eyes wherewith to recognize them, it is essential for you to consider whether the sort of life you are leading is conductive to your true well-being. If <br/>you are satisfied with what you are doing, you should at least exert yourself more and more for your advancement day by day. You should cultivate virtues like serenity, self-control, fortitude, forgiveness, composure of mind, contentment, truthfulness and compassion, should practise Japa, austerity, meditation and service, and give up vices like sloth, mendacity, sensuality, duplicity, thieving and adultery. Before undertaking any work one should carefully consider whether what he is going to do is really conducive of good to him and correct at once whatever defect appears to him therein. Human birth is rare gift. Even lacs of rupees cannot prolong one’s life even by a minute. Such a valuable life should never be wasted in sleep, lethargy, idle pursuits and indolence. Any one who passes his time listlessly is bound to come to grief. A Hindi poet has beautifully said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One who takes up any work without due consideration of its pros and cons surely comes to grief. Not only does he spoil the work and become an object of laughter in the eyes of the world, but he loses his peace of mind, and the pleasures of the world lose all charm for him, Giradhara, the poet, says that the laws of Karma are inexorable. A work done without due consideration pricks the heart like a spike.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

Hence one should wake up and be wise enough to devote the rest of his life to work conducive to one’s highest good.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If one does not engage according to his light and knowledge in works which are beneficial to him, here as well as hereafter, it will be nothing short of height of folly, indolence and sloth on his part. He who does not withdraw his mind from idle pursuits, lethargy and enjoyment of sense- objects and put it on the right track and proceed along the downward path, is his own enemy. The <span class="char-style-override-8">śruti </span>says—</p>

Therefore, the only wise thing for him is that he should be vigilant every moment of his life and, exercising self-control, should devote himself whole-heartedly to practices which insure his permanent good here as well as hereafter. Idle pursuits, lethargy, enjoyment of sense-objects and immoral practices ought to be given up as the greatest stumbling-blocks on this path, <span class="char-style-override-8">śruti</span> exhorts as follows—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, to take refuge in God is the foremost duty of those who believe in God. One who completely surrenders himself to Him can never perpetrate anything which is opposed to the will of the Lord. He attains a state which is beyond all fear; he is completely rid of grief and infatuation. He enjoys everlasting peace which nothing can disturb and his bliss knows no bounds. This ineffable state of his, cannot be understood or explained to others through example, words or signs. When even those who have attained such a state are unable to describe it, how can others do it? Mind and speech have no access there. It can only be experienced through one’s purified intellect. This is what the Vedas and the śāstras say—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एष सर्वेषु भूतेषु गूढोत्मा न प्रकाशते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">दृश्यते त्वग्रॺया बुद्धॺा सूक्ष्मया सूक्ष्मदर्शिभि:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Ka¢hopaniṣad 1. iii. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Concealed in all beings, the  tmā does not manifest itself. It can only be perceived through the pointed and subtle intellect, by men of subtle sight”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Himself says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद्‍बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेत्ति यत्र न चैवायं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Nay, in which the soul experiences the eternal and supersensuous joy which can be apprehended only through subtle and acute reason, and wherein established the said Yogī moves not from Truth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Every human being should endeavour to attain this state; it is the paramount duty of all.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-19">Our Duty</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we turn our attention to our duty, in most cases it will be found that we are lacking in diligence in the performance of it. A careful scrutiny will reveal defects at every step. Although all men crave for progress, and consider it desirable to put forth their best effort for the same, an examination will reveal many predisposing causes which stand in the way of their making the effort. Not only so, but being at their wit’s end as to what to do, they fall from the real path to progress.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore at the outset it should be thrashed out what is man’s duty, how he should attempt to carry out the same, and what are the obstacles on account of which he cannot make the best of effort, in spite of his desire to do the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Man’s first and foremost duty is to elevate his Self. The Lord says, “Man should elevate himself by the Self, he should not cause the Self to go down”.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> It should be, therefore, considered what is the self’s elevation, and wherein lies its degradation.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-24">* उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत्।</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Gradual increase, in the present and in the future, within oneself, of (spiritual) knowledge, (supreme) happiness, (unbroken) peace and the spirit of impartial justice is elevation of the self, and contrary to this, turning of the mind towards ignorance, error, unrest and injustice, is degradation of the Self.’ Forming constantly the habit of self-examination, man should devote himself to the effort at self-elevation and restrain himself from act that leads to degradation. In this world, association is the primary cause of the soul’s elevation or degradation. Association with him who has already elevated himself or is established in the path of spiritual elevation, is helpful to the soul’s elevation; and association with him who is already fallen, or is gradually leading towards a spiritual fall, fosters the soul’s degradation. Therefore, it is proper to associate constantly with high and elevated souls.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who is free from selfishness, arrogance, hypocrisy and anger, who does not seek honour, prestige or personal worship, whose conduct is exceptionally pure, whose sight and words lead to the advancement of love for, and faith in God, brings peace to the heart, and developing one’s belief in God, the other world and spiritually pure scriptures inclines one towards blessedness, should be regarded a high and elevated soul. Holding as a model the flawless conducts of such high, saintly souls, whether dead or alive, one should imitate them, and carry out their behests, and regulate one’s life by carrying out what appears to one’s intellect as good and conducive to bliss and peace. The Law-giver Manu says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेद: स्मृति: सदाचार: स्वस्य च प्रियमात्मन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतच्चतुर्विधं प्राहु: साक्षाद्धर्मस्य लक्षणम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The Vedas, Smr̥tis, conduct of saintly souls, and action which brings satisfaction to the heart—these four are said to be direct marks of Dharma.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here the question arises: are there no means for those who do not believe in our śrutis and Smr̥tis? Is it necessary for all to have faith in the śrutis and Smr̥tis? Being a Hindu, though the śrutis and Smr̥tis are extremely dear to me, and I am partial to them, it can never be reasonable if I assert that there can be no standard of right conduct besides the injunctions of the śrutis and Smr̥tis. An impartial consideration of the duty of man as a whole produces the conviction that the Lord and ruler of this universe is one and the same God. Almost all religious sects of the world, and schools of thought, cultivate faith in Him alone, in one form or another, and seek to draw their followers towards Him. Whatever books those sects and schools of thought regard as their holy scriptures, for them those very books are the scriptures, or authoritative books of their religion. For a person following a particular religion, adherence to all practices followed and advocated by the best ancient persons famous for their right conduct according to that religion, would be equivalent to following the scriptures. Such injunctions alone of the scriptures should be actually practised as appear good and beneficial to the intellect, when put to the crucible of reason. A man may be a good man, but we should imitate only such of his conduct as appear to our reasoning as best and highest. Such of his conduct as appear to us to be injurious, unworthy and of doubtful value should not be accepted as the standard of right conduct.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In case the association of a person, who has either already attained blessedness or has advanced towards blessedness, is not gained, or in case the heart recoils from the belief that anyone has attained to that state, one should pray to God for gaining the association of such a saintly soul, in the following strain— “O Lord, O Supreme Soul, O my Master, graciously bring me in contact with such great souls as are merged in Your Love with a sincere and devout heart.” If God is approached repeatedly with such prayer, through His grace the Sādhaka will surely gain contact with a saint favourable to his sentiments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here, again, the question arises that he and he alone who has faith in God, can offer prayers to God. It is possible for believers in God to have faith in saints and in the scriptures. But what is the duty of one who believes neither in God, nor in life after death, nor in the scriptures, nor in the saints ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The answer to this is that though the condition of such people is most deplorable, nevertheless they also can follow the means of their soul’s elevation according to their light. Such people should seek contact with persons who appear to their reason as superior to them. In this world, both among confirmed idiots and the wisest of men, it is almost generally believed that there are people who are superior to them as well as inferior. Therefore holding him as ideal, who appears to one’s reason as noble, highly discriminative, pure-hearted, possessed of right conduct as well as learning, one should disinterestedly imitate his good actions. If due to foolishness, conceit or any other reason, he fails altogether to regard anyone as superior to him, he should carefully put everything to the test of reason, and after proper discrimination what appears to his mind as conducive to blessedness, peace, felicity, public good, justice and righteousness should whole-heartedly accept the same, and act accordingly throwing away all considerations of self-interest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In almost all men there are primarily two types of impulses— one leading upwards, that is tending to elevate the soul, and the second leading downwards, that is tending to bring about the fall of the soul. Between these two impulses, one’s progress towards good induces one to devote oneself to good action, leads upwards; and that impulse of indiscretion which through the ego etc., the repository of pairs of opposites like attraction and repulsion, drives one to commit low and questionable acts, leads downwards. Through discrimination, man wants to elevate himself; but the impulse of indiscretion forcibly dragging him away from the path of good, pushes him along the path of evil. That is why Arjuna put this question to the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अथ केन प्रयुक्तोऽयं पापं चरति पूरुष:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनिच्छन्नपि वार्ष्णेय बलादिव नियोजित:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā III. 36)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Now impelled by what, Kr̥ṣṇa, does this man commit sin even involuntarily, as though driven by force.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In reply to this, the Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भव:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्धॺेनमिह वैरिणम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā III. 37)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is desire, it is wrath, begotten of the element of Rajas, insatiable and grossly wicked; know this to be the enemy in this case.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Proceeding further the Lord pointed out that it is enemies like desire etc., born of attachment in the form of attraction, which have extended their sovereignty over man’s senses and the mind. Therefore, first, releasing the senses and the mind from their bondage, evil impulses like desire should be eradicated. It is within the power of the Sādhaka to do this. That is why the Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियाणि पराण्याहुरिन्द्रियेभ्य: परं मन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्यो बुद्धे: परतस्तु स:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">एवं बुद्धे: परं बुद्‍ध्वा संस्तभ्यात्मानमात्मना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जहि शत्रुं महाबाहो कामरूपं दुरासदम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā III. 42-43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The senses are said to be greater than the body— but greater than the senses is the mind. Greater than the mind is the intellect; and what is greater than the intellect is he (the self). Thus Arjuna, knowing that which is higher than the intellect and subduing the mind by reason, kill this enemy in the form of desire, that is hard to overcome.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to these words of the Lord, man should attempt with greater and greater vigour to redeem his soul. Subduing the impulses of evil associated with the ego, consisting of pairs of opposites like attraction and repulsion, when the conscience or discrimination is awakened, everything is likely to be set right. This is performance of duty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it should be considered that although almost all men attempt to elevate themselves according to their light, their attempt does not meet with success. What are the principal obstacles which always hinder them from advancing along the path of progress? The answer to this is that due to evil association and evil habits they have raised so many obstacles, hence they cannot keep along the path of true progress. The following are the principal among them:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">(1)	Attachment—</span>The tendency of the mind which draws one to enjoyment of worldly things  like food and dress and other objects of luxury, as sweet to the senses, is called attachment. Man understands through reasoning that adultery is an evil, a sin. It is injurious to both the body and intellect to use a particular article of consumption. But desire in the form of sense of enjoyment, clouding his discrimination, drags him to the commission of those evils. Being overcome by this attachment, the senses forcibly drag the mind and drown it in the ocean of worldly enjoyment<br/>(Gītā, II 60). This impulse of desire should certainly be eradicated. To whatever objects the mind may be attracted, analysing their points of virtue as well as evil, one should oppose or renounce with all his strength, or through discrimination, what appears to be evil, or tending to bring suffering in the end, and welcome what appears free from evil and suffering.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">(2)	Hatred—</span>Transforming itself into anger, it destroys the power of reasoning as between right and wrong and forces man to commit whatever evil it likes. Just as when lust is roused, man can commit any form of crime, even so he will not hesitate to commit the greatest of crimes under the impulse of anger. Therefore, hatred should never be allowed to find a place in the heart. Whenever anger is roused against anybody, that very instant one should be forewarned and take recourse to discrimination. Action aken under the impulse or anger brings terrible suffering in future.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">(3)	Greed—</span>Men of discrimination have described greedas the begetter of sin. When greed is roused, thoughts of propriety and impropriety, truth and untruth cannot stand. To deceive and cheat others, to commit the most reprehensible acts for the  sake of money become almost like a habit with the man of greed, it is most difficult for a man of greed, who regards accumulation of wealth as the object of life to earn virtue. Therefore, depending on God and the law of Prārabdha (action which has begun to bear fruit), greed should be renounced. Lust, anger and greed these three have been described in the Gītā as doors leading to hell,destructive of the soul (XVI. 21).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">(4)	Fear—</span>When this appears man gives up fortitude and presently takes to sin. He who fearlessly proceeds along the path of equity and 	does not give up fortitude in the face of even the greatest of difficulties, does never suffer a fall, whether here or elsewhere. If God is visualized everywhere, then, fear can never exist; but through the practice of reasoning, holding fast to fortitude at heart, or even through recourse to heroism and courage, man can be fearless. Realizing this, one should always try to remain fearless. Unnerved by fear, one should never yield to wrong.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">(5)	Hypocrisy—</span>Concealing the evils in oneself out of greed, fear or ignorance, in  the interest of wealth, honour or prestige, to show good points which one actually does not possess, or to make special and impressive exhibition of one’s small merits, is called hypocrisy. This evil is a great obstacle in the path of blessedness. Of all the principal causes which lead to a Sādhaka’s downfall, this is particularly harmful. Evils like untruth, deceit, injustice etc., remain naturally hidden within the womb of hypocrisy. A hypocrite feels that he is cheating others, but as a matter of fact, he himself is cheated. Even meritorious deeds like performance of sacrifice, charities etc., done in a hypocritical spirit, get exhausted; not only so, in particular cases, the doer earns sin, instead of virtue. Therefore, a discerning man should carefully save himself from this evil. The present-day world is widely infected with this evil. It has become difficult to find a single person even among thousands, who 	may be totally free from the evil of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The five evils mentioned above are the primary defects. But besides them we have formed many habits as compel us to fall from the path of good. Though perceived by reason as directly harmful, we do not want to give them up, because they appear pleasant in the beginning due to our insensibility. For instance—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(a)	Depending on another’s support, leading the life of a parasite—He who is not self-dependent, who lives upon the earnings of another, or lives under another’s protection, can never elevate his thoughts. He has to surrender his ideas to the ideas of his protector. There may be occasions when he will commit even the murder of his best thoughts. Through constant suppression of his ideas, the process of germination of new good thoughts stops and like the body, his reason as well as conscience become dependent on another. Therefore, one should try as far as possible, to be self-dependent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(b)	 Ordering others for one’s physical comfort and	enjoyment, or accepting service from others—This habit has made us both worthless and arrogant. It has almost destroyed the spirit of equality. Therefore, one should, as far as possible, never accept service from another for one’s own comfort.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(c)	Spending money lavishly for one’s comfort, enjoyment or self-advertisement—This is such a bad habit that on account of this attempting to earn money by questionable means, man suffers an all-round degradation. What wrong does not one, who is a	slave to wealth, commit? Imitating the ways of men who are wealthier than us, we have so much raised our daily expenses, expenses of food, clothing and social practices like marriage etc., that our life has become full of the greatest sorrow and unrest on account of the same. That is why we have come to egard no means of earning money as illegitimate. Irrespective of whether Dharma is lost, justice is murdered, or sufferings of the country, community or neighbours are aggravated, we must have our pockets filled. In this abnormal growth of the greed for wealth, in which considerations of justice or injustice have no place, the habit of indulging in unnecessary expenditure is a primary cause. He who suffers from greed of wealth cannot easily	devote himself to spiritual discipline or the work of self-elevation. Therefore, man should attempt, as far as possible, to cut down his needs. He should bring down his expenditure, and spend only as much as is necessary for carrying on life. If he has a surplus of	money, he should utilize it in the service of the poor, the indigent and the cripple.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d)	Indolence, lack of diligence or wilful neglect of duty—Postponing the day’s work for the morrow,and doing work in a half-hearted manner only, these are extremely bad habits. For one who is subject to these habits, it is extremely difficult to rise, whether	in this world or the next. Time is short, the path is long. Before death comes, and the body becomes a prey to ailments, one should earnestly devote oneself to the performance of one’s duty. The moment an opportunity presents itself for a virtuous deed, one should be prepared immediately to perform it with	 enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(e)	Disobedience to parents and other elders—This habit is on the increase nowadays, specially among the educated. Continuation of disobedience to the loving behests of experienced elders is a great obstacle in starting one’s march in the path of blessedness.<br/>Through the blessings of elders, longevity, learning, fame and strength are increased. From their words	of advice laden with the wisdom of experience, we come to discern the way of providing for the means	of life. Therefore, as far as possible one should be diligent in carrying out the wishes of the elders.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(f)	Indulgence in backbiting, praise and unnecessary	tittle-tattle—Indulgence in reproach and praise of others, or unnecessary gossip, appears quite sweet to man. Among these scandal and gossip are the dearest. In reproach, praise and gossip loopholes are found for untruth, hatred and hypocrisy. Therefore, backbiting and unnecessary gossip should never be indulged in. Praise of another out of a selfish motive is also extremely bad. Attribution of excessive merits not present in a person, for serving some self-interest, is to deceive him. The praise of a man,  in appropriate words, when it is desirable, does not lead to any harm to the offerer of praise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(g)	 Seeking honour or social prestige, and welcoming the same when received—Like the tickle of the ringworm, it is an extremely agreeable disease, which though appearing pleasant in the beginning is very painful in the end. Nowadays in exchange for the insignificant value of honour and fame, the greatest of our virtues and deeds have all been disposed of. Whatever good deeds man performs, he throws them away by surrendering them to his desire for name and fame. Though he who does good deeds even for honour, fame and prestige is better than the indolent, worldly-minded person, nevertheless in the case of seekers of spiritual good, honour and fame do the greatest injury. Practices which may bring them attainment of the Parmātmā (God), the Gem or incalculable value, they lose in exchange for name and fame. Desire for name and fame is a terrible deep-seated, contagious disease which remains hidden	within the in most recesses of the heart. It is often found even in those who renounce wife, children and riches. Man cannot easily free himself wholly from this disease although he may realize by reason that it is an evil. The germ of this disease is spread over the whole world. Hardly even one among crores of people may be found to be free from this contagion. The total destruction of this craving takes place only when the truth about God is realized; but even before that through persistent effort it can be sufficiently brought under control. Therefore, one should ever persevere in the attempt to bring about its destruction. In this effort also care must be taken	that there may not grow, in return, improper obstinacy	as well as hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Avoiding the main hindrances mentioned above, he who attempts to elevate the soul may attain success in the end. Now, shortly, those chief practices also should be known, from which great help is derived in the uplift of the soul, and which are the main constituent part of duty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1)	Associating with saintly souls, and studying the purest scriptures, their meritorious deeds and teachings should be imitated and adopted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2)	Faith in the existence of God should be cultivated. The more faith in God increases, the more will the defects begin to disappear automatically. The stronger becomes faith in all pervading god the greater will be the elevation of the soul. Just as before the rising of the sun, through his mere distant indication alone, darkness disappears; so, even before one takes refuge in God, through mere development of faith in Him, sin gets uprooted and destroyed. On the growth of 	the belief that God is always and everywhere present, man can never and under no circumstance, be guilty of the commission of sin.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3)	Surrendering oneself to God, Japa of His name should be constantly practised disinterestedly and with spirit of Love, whatever Divine Name appeals to one’s heart, that very name is particularly beneficial to him. From whatever Name a person derived benefit, he sang its glory in the highest of terms. This should not lead one to the error that a certain Divine Name is superior and other Names are inferior. When an impartial view is taken, all Names of God would appear to be equally powerful. That which is the object of one’s worship, or dear to his heart,  is the best so for as he is concerned. Through one’s imagination, and according to sectarian belief, differences may be created, though in reality theyare non-existent. Therefore, those who do not practise Japa of the Divine Name should take to the Japa of whatever Name appears dear to them, and those who already practise Japa of a Name should, without introducing any change, increase, with the spirit of devotion and Love, their practice of Japa of that very Name.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) Meditation on a form of God should be practised. Whatever be the object of one’s worship, or howsoever God may have been perceived through	one’s imagination, one should constantly keep the mind engaged in meditation of that very form or idea of God. This much of belief, however, should be resolutely held in the mind about God that He exists, He is present everywhere, He is knower of every heart, He is Almighty, all-pervading, possessed of all Divine virtues, all knowing, primeval, eternal and the supreme Lover, greatest friend, best, the nearest of relations and the Supreme Teacher. Greater than He in respect of these virtues, or even His equal, there has been, or is none in the world, nor ever can be.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(5)	Through the mind, speech and body such efforts as appear to reason to be highly beneficial for spiritual	good should be constantly made disinterestedly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(6)	Strictness should be observed in carrying out what has been comprehended as duty. There should be no lapse in the performance of duty out of greed, fear, selfishness ignorance or any other reason what so ever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">These six are worthy of being understood as Duty, in the special sense of the term. All these I have written, in short, according to my ordinary understanding. It is possible, they may not appear worthy of consideration, or there may be other ideas superior to them. According to his light everyone should find out what is beneficial to him, and act in conformity with the same. Whatever appears undisputedly good to the intellect should never be renounced under the influence of any attachment whatsoever, beyond this, what else can man do? He who tries to elevate the self with the help of discrimination and reason, generally attains success. And one who surrendering himself to God, takes to the practice of a discipline in search of God, according to his own lights, regarding that to be an inspiration coming from God, is assured of success. Out of twenty-four hours of the day and night, man should generally spend six hours in the practice of Yoga, or performance of spiritual duty, six hours in earning livelihood by legitimate and righteous means, six hours in taking care of the body and six hours in sleep.<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-20">Necessity of Dharma</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The unanimous verdict of the Vedas, śāstras and the Purāṇas is that the universe rests on Dharma (the Divine Law), that Dharma alone fulfils human life. That Dharma alone guards man against sins and ushers him into a higher life; nay, it is Dharma alone which enables the soul to cross the great ocean of pain in this as well as the next world, both of which are full of woes. This is also corroborated by the utterances of saints and godly men as well as by the conduct of great men. The authors of Hindµu śāstras and Hindµu Saints have proclaimed this truth with great emphasis, while other nationalities too have always accorded a high place to religion. All of them have recognized their strength in Dharma alone. So far it has been held in all quarters that without Dharma a man’s life is reduced to the life of a beast. But of late a new current of thought has set in the world. Whereas in the past Dharma was regarded as one of the principal means of edifying our life, some people have now begun to look upon it as a cause of our degeneration.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some years ago it was published in certain newspapers that, pressed by the Anti-God Society of Russia, the Soviet Union issued a proclamation forbidding its members to join any religious function. Prior to this we had never heard of God being thus tabooed by ordinance. Of course, in Purāṇas we come across instances of such open defiance of God by Demon king like HiraṇyakaÜipu who persecuted his own child, Prahlāda, for the latter’s devotion to śrī Hari. Even in the kingdom of Rāvaṇa whose rule has become synonymous with a rule of terror, perhaps there was no such ordinance against belief in God. Otherwise how could a God-loving soul like Vibhīṣaṇa live in that kingdom ! True, from time immemorial there have been people who have denied the existence of God; but they, too never denounced Dharma. The greatest unbelievers have espoused the cause of righteousness and observed the laws of morality even with a view to making the world happy. The conception of Dharma might have differed with the different people at different times, but the canons of Dharma have been followed in every country and by the people of every nationality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This anti-religious movement is not progressing in Russia alone but the seeds of it have been sown even in other parts of Europe, as well as in America, Asia and Africa and among Christians, Buddhists and Mohammedans alike. What is to be regretted all the more is the fact that even in our own country, which has always regarded religion as its very life, some people, who are ignorant about the true nature of God and Religion, have begun to allege that “Dharma alone has brought about our ruin, that it is Dharma which has robbed the country of its independence and made us a subject nation, and that Dharma and Dharma alone is the main obstacle in the path of our all-round progress.” Those who profess and believe like that look upon all believers in God and Religion as deluded fools. They are not able to realize their own mistake and it is rather difficult for them to do so; for, when a man begins to look upon himself as the wisest and most learned of all, he does not appreciate even the best advice offered to him by anyone else, which is conflicting with his own views. One cannot say what will be the result of this anti-religious movement, although scriptural evidence as well as inference and reasoning lead us to conclude that this will land the country into a great woe. A man who does not recognize any Dharma becomes licentious and as the number of such men increases the fire of hatred and animosity blazes forth, and the result is universal suffering.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dharma alone makes a man self-controlled, couragious, forbearing, heroic, dutiful and a master of his senses. Dharma alone teaches us the virtues of compassion, harmlessness, forgiveness, commiseration, service, truthfulness and continence.</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Right para-style-override-9">(Bhumi-kh. 12. 47-48)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, is it possible for any nation or individual to be happy or progressive, who is a slave to mind and senses, lacking in intellect and wisdom, devoid of truth and forgiveness, impure in mind, speech and body, given to bloody acts, lacking in peace of mind, not practising charity, and given to usurping other’s property? Is it not absolutely necessary for every nation or individual seeking advancement to possess these essential characteristics of Dharma? Can a nation lacking in these fundamentals of Dharma prosper in the world? Let those who seek to destroy all traces of religion consider this question calmly as well as seriously and impartially only once and they will come to realize that Dharma is our sole companion and helpmate in this as well as the next world, that Dharma alone transports a man from the region of pain to the abode of bliss, from unreality to reality, and illumines our gloomy hearts. Dharma alone helps us in building character. Dharma alone can enable us to conquer the forces of unrighteousness. Dharma alone can eradicate wrongs and become instrumental in establishing rule of righteousness. The celebrated PāṇÎavas possessed more of righteousness than of man-power, that is why they came out victorious. It was repudiation of Dharma which brought about the downfall of Rāvaṇa even though he was very powerful and owned a huge and finely equipped army. It was repudiation of Dharma again, which brought Kaṁsa into disrepute and precipitated his death.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The names of Mahārāṇā Pratāpa and Chatrapati śivājī have been immortalized in the history of this country simply for their upholding the banner of Dharma. It was for the sake of Dharma that the brave sons of Guru Govind Singh cheerfully agreed to have themselves piled on a wall. It was to vindicate the cause of Dharma that Mīrā Bāī quaffed poison. It was for Dharma alone that Jesus mounted the cross. It was for Dharma and Dharma alone that the Lord Buddha emaciated his body by penance. It was with a view to setting up a lofty ideal of Dharma that king Yudhiṣ¢hira declined to visit the blissful heaven without taking his faithful dog with him. That is why their names are still remembered with reverence, although they cast off their mortal frames hundreds and thousands of years ago. If Dharma is lost, everything is lost. If Dharma leaves us with all its accessories, it will become easier for evil-minded people to loot others’ property and kidnap others’ wives, to persecute the poor and to do whatever they like. The very idea of a world without Dharma is shocking to a thoughtful mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence those who have some regard for Dharma should gird up their loins to do all they can for the preservation of Dharma. They should apply themselves to the task of propagating religious literature, broadcasting pure ideas of Dharma and investigating and preaching the subtle truths of Dharma. At the same time they should gather such moral strength by practising Dharma that they may be able successfully to stem the tide of this anti-religious movement. Our Sanātana Dharma has no quarrel with other religions. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Mahābhārata </span>says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That Dharma which is in conflict with another is Kudharma (bad religion). True Dharma is that which does not oppose any other religion.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">We wonder how does the question arise of abandoning such a universal Dharma. In this connection we should remember the following memorable words of Lord <br/>Manu—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Neither one’s parents nor one’s son, wife or other relations stand him in good stead in the life beyond death. Dharma alone stands by him there. One’s relatives leave his dead body like a log of wood or a clod of earth on the ground and come away to their homes; Dharma alone accompanies him after death. One should, therefore, gradually accumulate merit day by day to serve him in the next world, with Dharma by his side one crosses over even the insurmountable barrier of darkness.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-21">True Happiness and the Means of Its Realization </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Evil of Materialism</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now a days the majority of people, whether educated or uneducated, are engaged only in attempts for their material advancement, regarding worldly enjoyment as true happiness. They have become oblivious of the supreme truth that material enjoyment, derived from contact between the senses and their objects; is perishable, momentary and as its ultimate effect, pain in disguise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Many of our modern western-educated friends who regard themselves as thoughtful, wise and experts in argument, through their association with Englishmen, and at the sight of the latter’s love, for luxury and sensuality, are getting fascinated with the mirage of western civilization, neglecting our ancient, ideal civilization, through lack of understanding of the subtle truths of Dharma enunciated in the Vedas. The faith that the judgement, reasoning and wisdom of our ancient sages who possessed knowledge of the past, present and future were infinitely superior to that of ours, and that whatever means they have laid down for our growth and development were the best means for realizing true happiness, has almost disappeared from their hearts. There is need to convert such friends through argument, and attract them towards the ancient ideal. The welfare of us all lies in  this.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such friends, if they probe into the matter, will realize that in reality western civilization is ruinous to our country, religion, wealth, happiness, nation and our span of life on earth; and that it is due to its contact with this civilization that our country, being led away from its time-honouredreligious path, has taken to the present downward course. That is why our religious nation appears to be moving towards faint-heartedness and luxury, ideals unworthy of ryas. It is nothing but a tragedy to expect true happiness from a civilization which is destroying even our worldly felicity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A nation gets destroyed when it renounces its dress, language, customary food or drink, and standard of right conduct. It is most difficult to annihilate the existence of the nation which, while protecting these four, does not fall from its ideal. Therefore, we should make it a point to imitate the habits, dress and manners followed by our ancient Rṣis or sages only. Renunciation of one’s own Dharma is under no circumstances proper. The Lord said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुण: परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेय: परधर्मो भयावह:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III.35)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One’s own duty, though devoid of merit, is preferable to the duty of another well performed. Even death in the performance of one’s own duty, brings blessedness— another’s duty is fraught with fear.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Hindu nation and the Hindu religion began to deteriorate, when the Hindus, during Muslim rule, began to imitate the habits and manners of their rulers. Within a short time, eight crores of Hindus got converted into Muslims. Men who were once protectors of the cow, Brāhmaṇas and temples now became their enemies. This was nothing but the evil effect of the imitation of Muslim culture and Muslim habits and ideas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Till recently the English have been the rulers of the land. English education has been widely prevalent and still prevails in every corner of the country. Contact with the English has gone on for over a century. That is why English dress, language, food and manners have been rapidly adopted by the people of our nation. Simultaneously Hindu religion and Hindu sentiment have been on the decline and the influence of Christianity has grown and is still growing. We are in the grip of this calamity even now, the statement requires no proof. Renunciation of national culture and sentiments in imitation to others has led to this inevitable result.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, all our people should strongly realize the fact that western culture and its imitation are in no way beneficial to us. They lead to the destruction of our religious sentiments, and making us run after material advancement, compel us to remain deprived of our true welfare.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">True Happiness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Every intelligent person can, if he considers the problem, realize that through the attainment of birth as a human being, some exceptional gain must accrue to us. Food, drink, sleep, the joy of procreation and other forms of worldly enjoyment can be gained even in lower forms of life like that of beasts and insects. If the life of a human being is wasted only in the attainment of this joy, what do we achieve through the human birth? The supreme goal of human life is to gain that incomparable and true happiness, the like of which there is nothing in the world. That happiness is ‘God-realization.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Why Religious Practices are Ignored ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But although this is so, regarding the possession of wealth, women, children and other form of sense-enjoyment only as supreme happiness, the majority of people remain infatuated with them. Dutiful men who strive for real happiness are met with few and far between.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनुष्याणां सहस्त्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VII. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of thousands of men some rare soul strives to realize Me; of those striving Yogīs, again, some rare one (devoting himself exclusively to Me) Knows Me in reality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to this statement of the Lord, nowadays also among the few, who strive for the attainment of true happiness, scarcely any climbs up to the final storey of achievement. The majority of Sādhakas stop after pursuing a little practice. They cannot, therefore, raise themselves to a superior spiritual level. To my understanding, the following may be the cause of their lack of success—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1)	Qualified propagators of this teaching are very few in the world. For men of renunciation, learning, and right conduct, capable of hard labour, and true saints alone, can be the propagators of this teaching.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2)	Being satisfied with slight improvements Sādhakas do not feel any need for great spiritual efforts.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3)	Some Sādhakas get tired after pursuing a little amount of practice. They find themselves at their wit’s end considering their discipline to be of no particular benefit to them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4)	People generally lack faith in the attainment of true happiness, for as in sense-enjoyments, pleasure is not experienced in the initial stages of the spiritual practice. This contributes to lack of diligence in the practice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(5)	Some people regard the attainment of this happiness as beyond their power, and therefore remain sunk in despair.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides these, some other causes also may be mentioned; but among them all, ignorance or lack of diligence alone is the primary cause. Man should, therefore, devote himself to the performance of his duty with care and diligence.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Means of Realization of True Happiness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The śruti says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Arise (strive for religious practice), awake (from the sleep of ignorance), and approaching the saints understand the path which the learned describe as difficult and hard to tread as the sharp edge of a razor.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, not the least delay should be made in taking to the practice which leads to the attainment of supreme blessedness and supreme happiness in the form of God-realization. This is the highest duty of a human being; this is happiness in the greatest and truest form. Describing the glory of this happiness, the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद्बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेत्ति यत्र न चैवायं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वत:॥</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“And having obtained which he does not reckon any other gain as greater than that, and established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तं विद्याद्दु:खसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That state called Yoga, which is free from the contact of pain (in the form of transmigration), should be known. Nay, this Yoga should be resolutely practised with an unwearied mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though the means for the attainment of this true happiness is somewhat difficult, it is not altogether impossible of being accomplished. Even if difficult, it becomes wholly simple, smooth and exceptionally easy, when one takes refuge in God. The Lord makes the definite promise in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्यु: पापयोनय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">किं पुनर्ब्राह्मणा: पुण्या भक्ता राजर्षयस्तथा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनित्यमसुखं लोकमिमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IX. 32-33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, womanfolk, VaiÜyas (members of the trading class), śµudras (those belonging to the labouring class), and even those that are born of the womb of sin (such as the pariah), taking refuge in Me, they too attain the supreme goal. What wonder, then, that the holy Brāhmaṇas (members of the intellectual or priestly class) and devout royal sages should attain it. Therefore, having obtained this joyless and transient human life, devote yourself to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, with firm faith in God, and surrendering himself to God, let the Sādhaka strive to remove the obstacles in the path of his spiritual progress, by adopting the following means—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (1)	Approaching a Mahātmā (saint) whom he considers to be the best from the point of view of conduct, renunciation and knowledge, the Sādhaka should submit himself to the former and begin with energy the practice of a discipline according to the saint’s instruction. He should entertain firm faith in the words of the saint; approaching the latter he should not remain dubious or doubtful; he should not give preference to his own intellectual powers; if he fails to understand the instruction of the saints he should get his doubts removed by putting questions in a humble spirit; and starting the practice of the discipline, if he fails for some time to obtain happiness as a direct experience, he should never turn back from carrying out the instruction of the saint, believing in the supreme good which he will attain in the end.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदशिर्न:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IV.34)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Attain this knowledge by all means. If you prostrate yourself at the feet of the wise, render them all forms of service, and question them with a guileless heart, again and again, those wise seers of truth will unfold that knowledge to you.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (2)	The Sādhaka should never think that a day will come when he will give up his spiritual practice. On the contrary, he should regard it as his best wealth, supreme duty, sweetest nectar, greatest happiness and the best support of the life. Those who think that after attainment of the knowledge of God they do not require to submit themselves to any discipline commit an error. How can they renounce the practice which brings supreme peace to their heart. The condition of the saint after realization of God makes even men of evil conduct feel drawn towards spiritual discipline; his sight compels men without discipline to start the practice of a discipline. How can the saint himself be indifferent to that discipline? When this is so, people who on the realization of very slight spiritual progress begin to consider themselves accomplished are, indeed, in great error. This error creates obstacles in the spiritual path. It brings about their fall. One should, therefore, always safeguard oneself from this error.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (3)	The Sādhaka should entertain the firm faith in his mind that nothing is difficult for one who is dutiful and has taken refuge in God. He can easily accomplish the most difficult task. Every individual is, as a matter of fact, endowed with this capacity. To feel lack of capacity means degrading oneself. To an energetic man, even a hard and difficult task becomes easy of accomplishment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (4)	Every Sādhaka should go on examining himself. Through subtle analysis and examination, even his hidden defects may be made perfectly visible. The Sādhaka should know whether his mind has been brought under control; whether it has been made pure, one-pointed and freed from the entanglements of worldly objects. God-realization is a far cry till complete control over the mind and senses has been attained.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मति:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वश्यात्मना तु यतता शक्योऽवाप्तुमुपायत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI.36)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Yoga is difficult of achievement for one whose mind is not subdued; by him, however, who has the mind under control, and is ceaselessly striving, it can be easily attained through practice; such is My conviction.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, the Sādhaka should, in the first instance, bring his mind under control and make it pure and one-pointed.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> The scriptures primarily lay down two means for attaining this end.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-25">* Methods of mind-control have been discussed in a booklet entitled “Some Methods of Mind-control.”</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">They are—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1)	Practice, and (2) Dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI.35)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The mind is without doubt unsteady and difficult to curb, Arjuna; but it can be controlled through practice (of meditation) and dispassion, O son of Kuntī.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, Maharṣi PataÛjali says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोध:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yoga.I.12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Through Practice and Dispassion that (the mind) is brought under control.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For a detailed explanation of the terms “Practice” and “Dispassion” the reader should refer himself to the <span class="char-style-override-8">Yoga-Sµutras </span>and other books, but the Lord Himself has mainly described “Practice” as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चंचलमस्थिरम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वशं नयेत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 26)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Restraining the restless and fidgety mind from all those objects after which it runs, he should repeatedly concentrate it on God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With regard to “Dispassion”, the Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दु:खयोनय एव ते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आद्यन्तवन्त: कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुध:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā V. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pleasures which are born of sense-contacts are verily sources of pain (though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people). They have a beginning and an end (they come and go). Arjuna, it is for this reason that a wise man does not indulge in them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Thus, through “Practice” and “Dispassion” having made the mind pure, subordinate to self, one-pointed and full of Dispassion, one should take to meditation, with a view to keep it constantly fixed and steady in the form of God. For instance, the Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">संकल्पप्रभवान् कामांस्त्यक्त्वा सर्वानशेषत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनसैवेन्द्रियग्रामं विनियम्य समन्तत:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">शनै: शनैरुपरमेद्‍बुद्धया धृतिगृहीतया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मसंस्थं मन: कृत्वा न किंचिदपि चिन्तयेत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 24-25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Completely giving up all desires arising from thoughts of the world, and fully restraining the senses from all sides by mind, he should through gradual practice attain tranquillity; and having established the mind in God through reason controlled by steadfastness, they should not think of anything else.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When through “Practice” and “Dispassion” the mind has been made pure, free, one-pointed and full of dispassion, it becomes certainly easy to keep it engaged in the meditation of God; but even without fully bringing the above two methods into service, if man, surrendering himself to God, takes seriously to the practice of Japa of the Divine Name and meditation of God, he can gain everything even by this form of meditation. Soon the Sādhaka’s mind becomes pure, one-pointed and subordinate to him, there is not the least doubt about this.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Maharṣi PataÛjali also, while describing the quickest method of attaining Samādhi, said—</p>
<p class="Shlok"> ‘ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद्वा’ (Yogasutras I. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is, “Practice” and “Dispassion” are the undoubted methods of controlling the mind. The greater a Sādhaka cultivates them, the sooner he will attain mind-control. But through meditation of God also, the mind may be very quickly brought to the state of Samādhi.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this it may be concluded that practices like Japa, austerities, vows, charities, service of the masses, Satsaṅga and study of the scriptures, etc., are recommended and observed only for the practice of meditation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, the most direct, simplest and easiest means of attaining true happiness lies in the practice of constant meditation on the Form of God. The scriptural authorities have described it under the names of Dhyāna (Meditation), Smaraṇa (Remembrance) and Nididhyāsana (constant musing). In Karmayoga (Yoga of Action), Saṅkhyayoga (Yoga of Knowledge) and other practices, meditation on God holds the primary place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are many different forms of meditation which Sādhakas can adopt during the state of practice, according to their qualifications. The tastes of all men are not congenial to the same form of practice. There are many paths to reach a destined goal. Even so, though as the fruit of practice the same Supreme Object is gained, there are differences in the method of practice. Establishing identity with God, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, some people meditate on His Formless or Unmanifest State; while others meditate on an all-pervading God in the spirit of servant to a Master. Some meditate on the Lord’s Universal Form, while others on the Form of śrī Viṣṇu, possessed of four arms; some meditate on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa the holder of the flute, enchanter of the heart, while others on the Form of  śrī Rāma, the Best Person, who laid down the standard of propriety. While some others on the Form of śrī śiva, the embodiment of Blessedness.</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानयज्ञेन चाप्यन्ये यजन्तो मामुपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकत्वेन पृथक्त्वेन बहुधा विश्वतोमुखम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IX. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Others (JÛānayogīs) betake themselves to Me through their offering of knowledge, worshipping Me (in My Absolute and Formless aspect); as their very self; while still others worship Me in My Universal Form in many ways, taking Me to be diverse in diverse celestial forms.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, a Sādhaka should constantly meditate on a Form of God which may be more appealing to his heart, and for which he may have greater faith. The final goal is the same for all; there is no need to entertain the least doubt about the goal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sādhakas are generally found divided into two classes— viz., (1) those who worship God in an undivided way, i.e., establishing identity with Him; and (2) those who worship Him in the spirit of Master and servant. Among them, maintenance of constant identity with only one God, the Supreme Brahma, stainless, embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, is the best form of meditation for those who worship in an undivided way. But for the second class, viz., devotees who worship God in the spirit of master and servant, the scriptures have laid down various forms of meditation.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One does not succeed in meditation owing to ignorance about the process of meditation. The Sādhaka desires, indeed, to meditate on God; but, as a matter of fact, he meditates on the world. This defect is very commonly observed and heard. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to know the correct processes of establishing union of mind with God. Our scriptural authorities have attempted by various means, to explain these processes, some of which are being shortly described in the following lines. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Contemplation on God should, no doubt, be constantly carried on all the time, during work and rest, or during taking of food and drink, conversation or in the course of other forms of activity; but when the Sādhaka specially takes his seat for meditation, he should take care that worldly thoughts may not come up in the mind even in a secondary or subordinate sense, and start the practice of meditation seated in solitude and in a pure place.

<p class="TEXT-English">The Sādhaka intending to devote himself in meditation should specially know this fact that so long as consciousness of the body and the world remains, he should without fail carry on Japa of the Divine Name along with the practice of meditation. Without the help of Japa of the Divine Name, the mind cannot remain steady on the form of the Object of the Name, for any length of Time, Sleep, Indolence and various worldly latencies of the mind appear as hindrances and overwhelm the mind. The Name (of God) is the best means for keeping the Object of the Name (God) in mind. It does never allow the mind to forget the Form of its object. Thus the Name affords very strong help in the practice of meditation. Therefore, in the course of meditation, the Japa of the Name should never be stopped till the mind gets completely identified with the object of meditation. These are only some general points. Now, some definite processes of meditation will be placed before the reader.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Rules of Meditation according to the Path of Identity</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Sādhaka who intends to worship God following the path of identity should after taking his seat in the manner mentioned above, and renouncing all other thoughts, revolve these ideas in his mind—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">   (1)	All that exists is full of God, the embodiment of Bliss and Consciousness itself, the Supreme Brahma. Besides Him, there is absolutely nothing, which exists; the knowledge of that Brahma also belongs to Brahma alone. He is Himself the same as knowledge; He is never non-existent. That is why He is described as Truth, constant and eternal; He is boundless, immense and infinite. The mind, intellect, the ego, subject (seer), object (of sight) and the act of seeing, and whatever else is—all are but superimpositions on Brahma, and are the same as Brahma. As a matter of fact, besides God, the Supreme Brahma, nothing exists. The whole of creation like a dream is imagined in God.</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Taittirīya II. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Brahma is of the nature of Truth and Consciousness, and Infinite.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to this śruti, God, the embodiment of Bliss, Truth and Knowledge, exists; “Knowledge” is not a virtue, attribute, or a form of energy (śakti) of His apart from Him. In the same way, Sat (Existence) also is not a virtue, as distinguished from Him. He exists from eternity, and will eternally exist; that is why in common usage and in Vedic idiom, He is called Sat (Existence); but in reality He is beyond both Existence and Non-existence, Sat and Asat—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gītā XIII. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Brahma is said to be neither Sat (being) nor Asat (non-being).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus strongly fixing the thought on the incomprehensible Form of Brahma, let the Sādhaka, in this place of Japa, revolve, again and again, in his mind, in the following way, the attributes of God, and go on uttering the same. In reality, Brahma is beyond both name and form; but these attributes are conceived in order to bring out His Bliss aspect in the mind. Therefore, merging all his thoughts in Brahma who is Bliss itself, and meditating on such attributes of Brahma as ‘Perfect Bliss,’ ‘Unbounded Bliss,’ ‘Undisturbed Bliss,’ ‘Compact Bliss,’ Bliss, which is ‘Consciousness,’ ‘Bliss which is Knowledge,’ ‘Supreme Bliss,’ ‘Eternal Bliss,’ Bliss which is Real,’ ‘Bliss which is Life,’ ‘Bliss Absolute,’ ‘One, all-pervading Bliss’—let him make the thought stronger and stronger that nothing exists but Bliss. Simultaneously, with exceptional speed, entering and submerging the mind in Brahma, the embodiment of Bliss, let him realize these attributes as undifferentiated from God. Through this process repeated many a time, when all his thoughts get merged in God, when besides one God, the embodiment of Knowledge and Bliss, his mind becomes free of the thought of existence of any other thing, he becomes unshakably established in God who is Bliss itself and incomprehensible. When the practice having become ripe, through repeated meditation practised regularly everyday the Sādhaka no longer feels his self and the world at large as separate from God, when Knower, Knowledge and the Object of Knowledge, all become the same as Brahma the embodiment of Knowledge and Bliss, the Sādhaka becomes thoroughly accomplished; In that state, the Sādhaka, practice and the object of practice, all become one, all become the same as Bliss, and that state of the Sādhaka remains absolutely the same for all time. Whether moving about or seated, or engaged in the proper and punctual performance of every other duty, there is not the slightest deviation from his spiritual state. The Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VI. 31)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who, established in unity, worships Me as residing in all beings (as their very self), that Yogī, though engaged in all forms of activities, dwells in Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In reality, at no time he sees either the world or his self as separate from Brahma. That is why he is never reborn after death, and becomes freed for all time to come. In the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> it is said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्‍बुद्धयस्तदात्मानस्तन्निष्ठास्तत्परायणा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">गच्छन्त्यपुनरावृत्तिं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(V.17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Those whose mind and intellect are wholly merged in Him, who are constantly established in identity with Him and are exclusively devoted to Him, their sins being wiped out by wisdom, go to whence there is no return.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the ultimate result of the above form of meditation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Second Form of Meditation in the Path of Identity</p>
<p class="Shlok">यच्छेद्वाङ्मनसी प्राज्ञस्तद्यच्छेज्ज्ञान आत्मनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानमात्मनि महति नियच्छेत्तद्यच्छेच्छान्त आत्मनि॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Ka¢ha. I. iii. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A person endowed with understanding should restrain his speech and all other senses and absorb them in the mind; he should absorb the mind in the intellect, and the intellect in Mahat-Tattva (second Principle), the cosmic intellect; thereafter he should absorb the cosmic intellect in God who is tranquillity itself.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Retiring to a secluded spot, restrain the ten senses from running after their respective objects, in other words, controlling the functions of all the senses to engage the mind repeatedly in remembrance of the Form of God, means “absorbing speech and the other senses in the mind.” Thereafter, renouncing all doubts with regard to the Divine Form meditated upon, and reaching a settled conviction, to bring the mind to a state of calmness, that is, awakening or Knowledge to the total exclusion of all unsteadiness of the mind, means “absorbing of the mind in the intellect”. In this state of meditation, there remains consciousness of distinction between the meditator and his object of meditation, God, but after this stage when the individuality of the intellect, through which is reached a settled conviction about the Form of all-pervading God, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, the Supreme Brahma, gets absorbed in the aggregate intellect; when after cessation of all distinctions between the meditator, meditation and the object of meditation, there remains consciousness of the Form of only one God, the Supreme Brahma, who is Knowledge itself, the state is known as the absorption of the intellect in cosmic intellect.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the above, there arrives another indescribable state when there remains not the least residue of any separate impression of the meditator, meditation and the object of meditation, and one God alone who is Consciousness itself, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, remains, and beyond Him there remains no separate existence in any way—that state is called absorbing of the cosmic intellect in God who is tranquillity itself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is what they call seedless Samādhi, attainment of Brahma, the absolute, and attainment of beatitude. This is the last state of realization. Speech fails to describe this state, the mind cannot conceive of it. For it is a state beyond the mind, speech and intellect. This is final emancipation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching this state, man accomplishes the object of existence; no other duty is, then, left which he has to attend to. It is said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानव:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मन्येव च संतुष्टस्तस्य कार्य न विद्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XIII. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He, however, who takes delight in the Self alone and is gratified with the Self, and is contented in the Self, has no duty.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the path of identity, there are many other methods of meditation on God which cannot be described here because the article has already grown in length. The purport of all is almost the same. For Sādhakas who worship God in the spirit of identity it is extremely profitable to constantly remember the following verse of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सूक्ष्मत्वात्तदविज्ञेयं दूरस्थं चान्तिके च तत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XIII. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is without and within all beings, and constitutes, both animate and inanimate creation. By reason of its subtlety, it is incomprehensible1; It is both at hand and far away.”<span class="char-style-override-10">2</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-6">1. Just as water particles in the rays of the sun, because of their minuteness, cannot be seen by the ordinary people, even so because of His minuteness the All-pervading God cannot be known by the ordinary people.</p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-6">2. Inasmuch as God pervades all space and is the soul of every being, He is nearest to all.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">  Because of their want of Knowledge, He is far, far away from people who are faithless and ignorant.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, the Sādhaka whose heart is inclined towards following the path of Identity—should devote himself to the practice as laid down above without delay.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Meditation on the Universal Form of God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If, after he has sat for meditation with closed eyes in a solitary place, the thought of the illusory world does not leave the mind of the Sādhaka, he should adopt the following line of thought.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever things in the three world, viz. the earth, the intermediate region between earth and heaven and the heaven are observed, heard or conceived by the mind all of them directly constitute the bodily form of God Himself. With the help of His energy called Māyā, It is God Himself, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, who is manifested in this Universal Form. For instance, the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वत:पाणिपादं तत्सर्वतोऽक्षिशिरोमुखम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वत:श्रुतिमल्लोके सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XIII. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It has hands and feet everywhere, eyes, head and face everywhere, ears everywhere. It stands pervading all.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">* Just as ether, being the cause of air, fire, water and earth, exists pervading them all, even so God, being the cause of everything, exists pervading the whole of creation, both animate and inanimate.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अथवा बहुनैतेन किं ज्ञातेन तवार्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विष्टभ्याहमिदं कृत्स्नमेकांशेन स्थितो जगत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(X. 42)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Or, what will you gain by knowing all this in detail, Arjuna? Suffice it to say that I stand holding this entire universe by a fraction of my yogic power—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यच्चापि सर्वभूतानां बीजं तदहमर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न तदस्ति विना यत्स्यान्मया भूतं चराचरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(X. 39)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, I am even that which is the seed of all beings. For there is no creature, animate or inanimate, which exists without Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reflecting thus, again and again, and regarding the whole of creation, as in ultimate analysis, a Form of God, the mind should be fixed on the ascertained Divine Form. This practice quickly removes the unsteadiness of the mind. Thereafter, wherever the mind goes it sees only God. Nothing appears before it except God. Just as one who understands the many varieties of dolls made of ice, as in essence nothing but water, does not fall into error regarding their constituent water, and definitely sees all the dolls as water, even so the Sādhaka who carries on the above form of meditation on God, sees the entire universe as God. In his conception, there exists nothing as the world; his mind becomes calm and free from doubt. This is also an easy method of fixing the mind on God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Meditation of the Four-armed Form of śrī Viṣṇu</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Retiring to a solitary place, and seated in the posture mentioned above, let the Sādhaka close his eyes and intoxicated with joy start the practice of meditation with a strong desire in his heart to meet the Supreme Beloved.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The meditation should be carried on either by fixing the mind on a Image of God seen in a temple or a picture of God, or a Form conceived by the mind of the Sādhaka after hearing from saints, or seeing the Lord in a dream, if he is fortunate enough to go through that experience; in other words, fixing the mind on whatever the Sādhaka may have understood, or whatever notion he may have formed, about God’s Form. Meditation on a Form of God may be ordinarily carried on as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">   (1)	The Lord is present before us in the sky about one and a quarter cubit above the earth. His most beautiful lotus-feet shining like a heap of sapphires look as bright as an infinite number of suns. His soft toes with glittering nails are adorned with gold ornaments studded with gems. Like His lotus-feet, the Lord’s knee and thigh are shining like heaps of blue gems through His yellow robe.  Oh ! how graceful are His four long arms! He holds the conch and His circular weapon (Cakra) with the two upper hands, and the club and lotus with the two lower hands. All the four arms are adorned with armlets and other most beautiful ornaments. Oh ! how broad and supremely beautiful is the chest of the Lord, with marks of śrī Lakṣmī and Bhr̥gu’s foot in the middle of it ! The Lord’s neck possessed of the beautiful colour of a blue lotus is most handsome to look at, and is adorned with a necklace studded with gems, the Kaustubha diamond and many varieties of beautiful garlands made of gold and sweet smelling flowers as well as with the Vaijayantī garland. His chin is graceful, the lips are red, the beautiful aquiline nose is adorned with a pearl hanging from it. Both the eyes of the Lord are as large as lotus leaves, and are similar to the blue lotus in bloom. The ears are adorned with ear-drops shaped like the crocodile, the forehead contains the Tilak mark with a red streak (mark of śrī) in the middle, and the head is adorned with a lovely crown studded with pearls and precious stones. Oh! the incomparable enchanting face of the Lord, putting the full moon into shame, is fascinating the mind! Like the rays of the sun, there is an aura round the Lord’s face whose light has made the gems in His crown and other ornaments a thousand times more brilliant. Oh ! I am blessed today, perfectly blessed, that I have the privilege of meditating of the gently smiling, cheerful Form of śrī Hari.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When through continuous meditation on this line, the Lord’s form becomes firmly established in the mind, Sādhaka overwhelmed with Love, should fix his mind on that enchanting Form. He will attain absorption in the Form of the Lord, when through repeated practice of meditation he will lose consciousness of the self and of the world outside and even of his meditation, and retain the consciousness of God, the enchanter of the heart alone. When it happens, the Sādhaka immediately comes to know the real truth about God, and God becomes compelled through the power of the Sādhaka’s Love to manifest Himself in a definite Form, and grace the Sādhaka with Divine vision.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">There are many other processes of meditation on God in both His aspects, viz., with Form and without Form. In the present article, only some short indications of them have been given. Special knowledge on the subject can be gained when a Sādhaka seriously starts his practice, surrendering himself to God and the grace of saints. With regard to meditation on God’s aspect with Form, only two processes of meditation on śrī Viṣṇu have been described in this article. Following these processes Sādhakas can meditate on the Forms of śrī Rāma, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, śrī śiva and other Forms of God, according to their respective faith and liking. The fruit of all such practice is the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On rising from meditation in solitude, when the Sādhaka enters the field of activity, he should, during all his works and while moving about and resting, try to carry on in the same manner, the Japa of the Name of his chosen deity and meditation on His Form. Not a moment of this invaluable life should be allowed to pass without remembrance of God. One remembers during his last moment whatever is constantly practised by him throughout the life; and his future is determined by the thoughts of the last moment. That is why the Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्मात्  सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII. 7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, Arjuna, think of Me at all times and fight. With mind and reason thus surrendered to Me you will doubtless come to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, through continued meditation on God, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss; the Supreme Brahma, the heart of the Sādhaka grows purer and spotless. All his worries are gone and the heart overflows with unique peace that passes understanding. The mind gets one-pointed, and comes under control. True happiness goes on gradually growing within him, as through intensification of practice, the purity and concentration of his mind increase. When the Sādhaka gains even the slightest experience of this true happiness, he begins to look upon the joy of even sovereignty over the three worlds as quite worthless and insignificant compared to it. In this state, the joy derived from ordinary enjoyments of the world offers not the slightest temptation. On the contrary, all enjoyments begin to appear as perishable, momentary and full of woe. Through this practice, all the impulses of the Sādhaka’s mind get speedily withdrawn from the world and become fixed and established in God. Realizing for all time the true and infinite happiness, the Sādhaka gets satisfied and contented. All his sorrows totally cease. The attainment of this state is the ultimate goal of human existence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dear reader, we should cultivate the firm conviction that the supreme duty of a man’s life is only to realize God, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, the Supreme Brahma, the Almighty Lord, the Bestower of Happiness. In the world and the next, the greatest, the eternal, the truest happiness lies in this. Apart from it, whatever other forms of happiness appear in the world, are in reality no happiness at all. They are all, truly speaking, misery and nothing but misery, The <span class="char-style-override-8">Yoga DarÜana </span>says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परिणामतापसंस्कारदु:खैर्गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दु:खमेव सर्वं विवेकिन:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Therefore, renouncing wholly the transient, perishable and artificial enjoyments of the world, we should speedily devote ourselves, with energy and determination to the practice leading to realization of God, the embodiment of true happiness.<span></span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The mind of who has taken refuge in God prays to the Lord—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Lord! O Sustainer of the Universe! O Kind-hearted Protector of the distressed! O Ocean of Mercy ! O Knower of the heart! O Saviour of the fallen! O Almighty Lord! O Friend of the poor! O Nārāyaṇa! O Hari! Have pity on me, have pity on me! O Lord ! O Reader of man’s thoughts! You are famous throughout the world as ‘Ocean of Mercy’ and ‘Almighty,’ therefore it is Your Nature to show compassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Lord, If Your Name is ‘Purifier of the fallen,’ please come, and grant me Your vision. Bowing, again and again, to Your feet, I beseech You humbly, O Lord, bless me with Your sight. O Lord, except You I have none in the world whom I can call as my own. Please grant me once the privilege of Your sight, do not tantalise me any more. You are called ‘Sustainer of the Universe,’ then why do You not satisfy my heartfelt desire? O Embodiment of mercy! O Ocean of grace! Show me Your compassion. Being an Ocean of compassion, a little shower of compassion will bring no diminution of the quality in You. Through only a slight expression of Your grace; the whole of this universe may be saved. Then, what does it cost You to save this insignificant soul? O Lord, if You look to my doings, there is absolutely no hope for me. Therefore, paying attention to Your Name as ‘Saviour of the fallen,’ grant to this insignificant soul the privilege of Your sight. I know neither devotion, nor Yoga, nor any other practices, that I may claim the privilege by virtue of my performances. Being the knower of man’s thoughts, if You had not been an Ocean of mercy, none would have called You by the latter name in this world; and being an Ocean of mercy if You could not read the anguish of the heart, none would have called You as the ‘Knower of the heart.’ Though possessed of the above two virtues, if You had lacked in power, none would have called You Almighty, and possessed of all powers. If You had been only a Lover of devotees, none would have called You as ‘Saviour of the fallen.’ O Lord! O Ocean of mercy! Have pity on me, and grant me once Your sight. (1) </p>

<p class="Shlok">ये भजन्ति तु मां भक्त्या मयि ते तेषु चाप्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IX. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“They, however, who devoutly worship Me abide in Me, and I also stand revealed in them.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-4">* Just as subtle, all-pervading Fire becomes manifest, only when a fire is made through the lighting up of combustible matter; even so God, who pervades everywhere, is revealed in the heart of one who practises Bhajana with a devoted heart.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O mind, though being the Ocean of compassion, if śrī Hari (God) does not show compassion, there is nothing to worry; you should go on performing your duty. God is a Lover, He recognizes love; the subject matter of Love is known only to the Lover. Can God, the knower of heart, grant you His vision, drawn by your pretended Love ? When the strings of Pure Love, Reverence and Faith are ready, bound by them, God will Himself come to you. O stupid mind, can false prayers produce any effect ? Is not God the reader of hearts ?<br/>O mind, good-bye to you; your habit is to wander about the world, please go wherever you like. Being associated with you, I have roamed these years in this unsubstantial world. Now, having taken refuge at the feet of God, your entire fraud stands revealed to me. For my sake, you deceitfully offer prayers to God in humble and beseeching words, but you do not know that God is a reader of the heart. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Yogavāsiṣ¢ha</span> truly says that God cannot be realized till the mind is transcended, in other words, till it is destroyed. Exhaustion of desires, destruction of the mind and God-realization—these three processes take place simultaneously. Therefore, I entreat you to retire from here gracefully; this bird will no longer be caught in the net of your phantasms, for it has taken refuge at the feet of śrī Hari (God). What Do you mean to leave after swallowing the bitter pill? Oh! Where is that phantasy? Where are the enemies—anger, lust and others? Your entire army is now going to be destroyed. Therefore, giving up the hope of exerting your influence, go wherever you please. (2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind, again, prays to God—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Lord, have pity on me; O Master, I surrender myself to You, O Protector of the refugee, save the honour of one who has taken refuge in You. O Lord, help me, help me; come, and grace me with Your sight, I have no support in this world except You; therefore, I bow You, again and again; I make obeisance to You. Please make no delay, quickly come and give me the privilege of Your sight. O Lord, O Ocean of mercy, come once and take care of this bond-slave. In Your absence, I find no support to my life, O Lord, have pity on this slave; I have surrendered myself to You, please cast but once Your kind look on me. O Lord, O Friend and Protector of the helpless, do not balk me any more, have pity on me. Without looking at my wickedness, reveal Yourself as the saviour of the fallen. (3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The individual soul, addressing the mind again, <br/>says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O mind, take heed! Be careful! why do you indulge in these idle talks. God does not want your false humility. Your deceit will not be successful here; why do you offer to God these hypocritical prayers for my sake? I do not want you to make such prayers; you may go wherever you like.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If God is the knower of the heart, where is the need to offer any prayer? If He is a Lover, what is the need to call Him? If He is the sustainer of the Universe, what is the need to beg of Him? Good-bye to you, go hence; go. (4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The individual soul, addressing the intellect and <br/>senses says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O sense! Good-bye to you, you also, please, leave me. Where there are desires, there you have the ground to stand upon. I have taken refuge at the lotus-feet of God; therefore, your stratagem will make no impression on me. O intellect! Good-bye also to you. Where did you leave your wisdom, when you used to prompt me to dive into the ocean of the world ? Is that teaching of any use now? (5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The individual soul says to God—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> O Lord, You are the knower of the heart, therefore I do not say that You should grant me Your vision. If I have possessed full love, could You tarry! Could even Lakṣmī detain You at Vaikuṇ¢ha? If I had possessed full faith in You, could You wait ? Could my love and faith leave You? Oh! Falsely have I assumed in the world the roles of disinterestedness and desirelessness and in vain do I regard myself as a refugee at Your feet, but I need not worry; whatever I obtain, I should feel delighted in the same. For, that is Your instruction in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span><span class="char-style-override-10">*</span>. </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, while merged in Your love, if I attain even hell, it will be superior to heaven. Why should I, then, worry? If I gain love for You, will You not develop the same for me? When absence of Your sight will become unbearable to me, will You, then, be able to tarry?

<p class="TEXT-English">Gaining the vision in meditation of the wonderful Saguṇa Form of the Lord (Form with attributes), the individual soul mentally describes the beauty of that Form—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Oh! How beautiful are the lotus-feet of the Lord, which, sparkling like a heap of blue gem, shine like an infinite number of suns. The soft toes containing glittering nails are adorned with gold anklets studded with gems.

In the upper two hands, there are the conch and His circular weapon Cakra, and in the two lower, the club and the lotus. All the four arms are adorned with armlets and other beautiful ornaments. Oh! How beautiful is the bosom of the Lord, the middle of which contains the marks of śrī Lakṣmī (Goddess of Wealth) and Bhr̥gu’s foot. How charming, again, is the neck of the Lord coloured like a blue lotus, containing a necklace studded with gems, the Kaustubha diamond, and adorned with necklace of pearl and gold, the Vaijayantī garland and other garlands of many varieties of flowers. His lips are beautiful and red. His nose containing a pearl hanging below is exceptionally charming. The Lord’s two eyes are as large as leaves of the lotus, and bloom like the blue-lotus. His ears are adorned with beautiful crocodile-shaped ear-drops studded with gems, the forehead contains the Tilak mark with a red streak in the middle, and the head is adorned with a crown studded with gems. Oh! How charming is the round face of the Lord looking like the full moon containing an aura emiting rays like that of the sun, which sparkle through the gems in His crown and all other ornaments. Oh! I am blessed today, indeed, truly blessed that I see before me God, the embodiment of bliss, mildly smiling through His lips. (8)</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-23">The Path of Devotion in the Gītā</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span> is an incomparable book of spiritual lore, a store-house of the principles of Action, Devotion and Knowledge. It cannot be said that the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> deals primarily with this or that particular path or discipline. Although it is a small book in which the various topics have been touched upon only briefly, the treatment of none of these is incomplete. It has, therefore, been truly said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या किमन्यै: शास्त्रविस्तरै:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">या स्वयं पद्मनाभस्य मुखपद्माद्विनि:सृता॥<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is needless to traverse the vast field of spiritual literature, the <span class="char-style-override-8">G</span><span class="char-style-override-8">ītā</span> alone should be read and reread with care, the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> which proceeded from the lotus-like lips of Padmanābha (Mahāviṣṇu, from whose navel sprang the lotus, the place of origin of the Creator, Brahmā) Himself.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The intention of the above verse is not to discourage the study of the other scriptures, but only to bring out the real worth of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>. One who has realized the truths contained in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> has nothing more to know. The different disciplines of Action, Worship and Knowledge have been dealt with in their respective places thoroughly and clearly. It cannot, therefore, be said that one is the main, and others are subsidiary themes of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>. Whatever point of view is dear to one, whatever doctrine he may believe in, finds its support in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>. That is the reason why different commentators have offered different interpretations of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>. None of them can, however, be pronounced to be incorrect. Just as the Vedas represent the breath of the Paramātmā even so the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> representing as it does the words uttered by God is nothing but God Himself manifested in that Form. That is why like God Himself the teaching of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>, too, appear in different lights to different devotees according to their respective mental constitution. Making the spiritual need of His dear friend and devotee Arjuna on an occasion, the Lord delivered His incomparable message of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> for the good of entire humanity. To discourse or write on any point mentioned in that book is nothing but a puerile attempt on the part of a person like me. I am fully conscious of my incompetence to deal with present subject. It is therefore, my humble prayer that learned and devoted souls who may happen to read these lines will kindly excuse me for this childish attempt.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Although each of the paths of Action, Devotion and Knowledge has its own importance in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> it may nevertheless be stated that devotion is the main theme of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>, that there is hardly any chapter which contains no reference to Bhakti. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> begins with Devotion and ends with Devotion too. At the very commencement of the discourse, Arjuna surrenders himself to the Lord saying <span class="char-style-override-7">‘शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्’</span> (pray instruct me; I take refuge in Thee). Similarly, at the conclusion of the discourse the Lord lends His fullest support to, nay, enjoins, the attitude of complete surrender to and dependence on God, i.e., Himself when He says <span class="char-style-override-7">‘सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज’. </span> (Relinquishing dependence on all other virtues take refuse in Me alone), and further takes upon Himself the responsibility of absolving Arjuna from all sins. It is agreed on all hands that attitude of surrender represents a form of Devotion. Of course, the devotion taught by the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> is not a blind faith devoid of discrimination or an ignorant relinquishment of duty through sloth or inertia; it is an active form of devotion based on discrimination. This devotion can be properly practised by aspirants who have approached the perfection of God, the fullest embodiment of perfection. The Lord Himself has described the character of this Devotion in the twelfth chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>. In devotion as taught by the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> there is no room for sin. How can it be possible for a devotee who has made God his sole refuge in life, who sees and feels the presence of God on all sides and in every object, to commit any act of sin even in secret? How can devotee who having surrendered himself entirely at the feet of the Lord desires to make himself completely subservient to His will be capable of any sinful act ? How can a devotee who, realizing the creation to be a manifestation of the Lord, considers it his duty to render service to all, be indolent or lethargic ? How can he who possesses the light of true knowledge of the Paramātmā find himself in the region of Darkness or Ignorance?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was therefore, that the Lord gave the following express command to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम्॥<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VIII. 7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, Arjuna think of Me at all times and fight with mind and reason thus surrendered to Me, you will doubtless come to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This represents what they call Devotion accompanied by disinterested action which is a sure way to realize God. Similar injunctions were uttered by the Lord in IX. 27, XVIII. 57, and some other verses of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This does not mean that the Lord did not say anything separately and exclusively either about Karmayoga (Action) or about Bhaktiyoga (Devotion). Verses like <span class="char-style-override-7">‘कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते’</span> (the right is only to action), <span class="char-style-override-7">‘योगस्थ: कुरु कर्माणि’</span> (perform action while established in Yoga) refer only to Karma (action); and verses like <span class="char-style-override-7">‘मन्मना भव’</span> (fix thy mind in Me) refer only to Bhakti (devotion). But in these statements also the dependence of Karma on Bhakti, and of Bhakti on Karma may be detected though not expressly stated. One who engages in action while established in Yoga through internal equilibrium and knowing the result of action to lie in God’s hands indirectly practises devotion through remembrance of God, and a devotee engaged in devotional practices like worship, obeisance etc., may be similarly said to be doing some action through those practices. The difference between him and an ordinary person who performs action through attachment lies in this that while the latter engages in action for the fulfilment of his own worldly desires the former does so only for the pleasure of God. The <span class="char-style-override-8">G</span><span class="char-style-override-8">ītā</span> has denounced renunciation of action for its own sake, and has characterized such renunciation as Tāmasic in character (<span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> XVIII. 7). And stating in verse 4 of chapter III., that perfection cannot be attained by renunciation of action, it has been pointed out in the next śloka that complete and absolute renunciation of action is impossible. Therefore, according to the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> Devotion lies in pursuing through body and mind all kinds of action appropriate to the caste in which a person is born, for the sake of God, taking the performance of such action as being enjoined by God, fixing the mind completely and whole-heartedly in God Salvation in the form of supreme perfection is attainable by this devotion. The Lord says<span class="char-style-override-7">:</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत: प्रवृत्तिर्भूतानां येन सर्वमिदं ततम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानव:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 46)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He from whom is the emanation of all beings, by whom all this is pervaded—by worshipping Him through the performance of his own duty, man attains perfection.” This form of action instead of being the source and cause of bondage brings salvation, there is no danger of a fall through its pursuit. God has enjoined all spiritual aspirants to take up and pursue the path of action for God-realization and citing His own example has advised even the liberated soul to engage in action for the good of the people, for guiding them along the right path, although, personally speaking, he has no more duties to perform—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते’।</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Moreover, Arjuna was a Kṣatriya, a family man and a man of action; that is the reason why he was specially advised to follow a path in which there is combination of Devotion and Action. Truly speaking this is what is necessary for the good of the people. There is predominance of Tamoguṇa (ignorance and darkness) in the present-day world. It is on account of this Tamoguṇa that people who retire into seclusion are debarred from attaining divine knowledge and though outwardly engaged in prayer and meditation, they fall a pray to sleep, sloth and inaction. It is found in many cases that people who give up work saying they would henceforward live in seclusion, spend their time in devotional practices and meditation alone, soon get disgusted with their life of seclusion. Some of them begin to spend their time in sleep, while others are found to complain that they do not find any zest in meditation. Thus some of them turn out to be idlers, while others begin to indulge themselves through enjoyment of the senses. Persons who truly and sincerely devote themselves to prayer and meditation are very rare. To engage oneself wholly in devotional practices and meditation, while living in seclusion, is not undesirable, but it is not so easy as we imagine it to be. Long and sustained practice is necessary to reach this stage and the practice may be developed and made more intense by a gradual process even while performing the ordinary duties of one’s life. It is, therefore, that the Lord has enjoined us to perform action in a spirit of detachment constantly meditating on Him, taking such action as a behest from Him and solely for cultivating His pleasure. Engagement in or withdrawal from action is neither a hindrance nor a help in reaching a state of deep meditation of the Lord. Genuine faith, reverence or Love is the main factor helpful to meditation. Where there is faith, where there is love, action cannot be a hindrance; on the contrary, every single action of such a person being performed for God’s pleasure is converted into devotion in its purest form. This, too, does not prove the necessity of renunciation of action. Nor is it my intention to discourage the constant practice of devotion in seclusion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> For those who are qualified, “living in seclusion” <span class="char-style-override-7">(विविक्तदेशसेवित्वम्)</span> and “absence of enjoyment in the company of men <span class="char-style-override-7">(अरतिर्जनसंसदि)</span> are no doubt the proper course, but in the world as it is constituted the majority is found to consist of those who are qualified to follow only the discipline of Action. He alone is really qualified to live in seclusion who is completely absorbed in the devotion of God, whose heart overflows with undivided love for God, who begins to feel uneasy when he forgets the Lord even for a moment, who cannot properly perform his worldly duties having lost all consciousness of the outside world through ecstasy of divine love and to whom the very sight or mention of enjoyments of the world is tormenting. For persons possessing these qualifications it is certainly more beneficial to remain aloof from society and keep themselves constantly engaged in spiritual practices in sequestered places. They do not give up work, it is work that takes leave of them. Such men when they retire to secluded places never yield to laziness nor do they indulge in worldly thoughts or desires. On the contrary, seclusion steadily swells the stream of their devotion which unites them in no time with the great ocean of Divinity and enables them to merge their individual existence into the infinite, illimitable expanse of that ocean. But those who are troubled by worldly impulses and distractions while living in seclusion are not qualified to suspend their activity for any length of time and lead a life of devotion in seclusion. The vast majority of people in this world belong to this last category. The practice followed by wise men is to suggest those methods alone which are suitable for the majority. Special efforts should, therefore, be made to turn the course of one’s activities approved of by the śāstras, towards God, and not to renounce them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been stated above that Arjuna was a family man, a Kṣatriya (one belonging to the warrior class) and a man of action, therefore, he was enjoined to stick to the path of Action. This, however, does not mean that the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> is intended for family men, Kṣatriyas and men of action only. There is no doubt that this nectar-like milk in the form of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> has been available to the world only through the medium of Arjuna who acted as a calf to cause the milk to flow. It is so sweet, so universally useful that people of all countries, all communities, all classes, and all  Üramas (orders) can drink it without let or hindrance, and attain immortality. Just as God is within the reach of all, even so the teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> are open to all. Of course, it is necessary that he who seeks to derive benefit from the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>, should have an unimpeachable conduct and should be endowed with faith, devotion and love. For the Lord has warned us not to propagate its message among irreverent and unwilling persons and among those who have fallen from the path of virtue or who lack the spirit of devotion (<span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā </span>XVIII. 67). Any one who has taken refuge in God, to whatever race or class he may belong, is qualified to drink this nectar (<span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> IX. 32).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">There are, it may be urged, only two paths of spiritual discipline in the Gītā, the path of Knowledge and the path of Action, there being no mention of a third discipline like Devotion how can it, therefore, be said that Devotion forms the main theme of the Gītā? The answer to this is that though Devotion has not been mentioned as a distinct path or discipline, we should first try to understand what is actually meant by a discipline, and whether the path of Action or even that of Knowledge can be followed without cultivation of the spirit of worship or devotion. Action without the spirit of worship degenerates into a lifeless action, hence it cannot lead to emancipation, nor is Knowledge without Devotion commendable. According to the Gītā Devotion should form an integral part of the both the disciplines of Action and Knowledge. The word Niṣ¢hā indicating a discipline, etymologically means ‘being established in the Paramātmā.’ One gets established in God in two ways—as distinct from God and as identical with Him. In the former state he recognizes God as the whole (<span class="char-style-override-7">अंशी</span>) and himself as a part (<span class="char-style-override-7">अंश</span>), God as the object of worship, and himself the worshipper. Work which is done with the above recognition and with the motive of pleasing God, in accordance with the injunctions of God, without attachment to the result of such work constitutes what is known as Karmayoga or disinterested action. And the latter state or the state of identity with Brahma, which is consolidated truth, knowledge and bliss, is that in which all action taking place in Prakr̥ti (Nature), is recognized only as play of Prakr̥ti, as nothing but illusion, and all existence is resolved into a unity— the unity of Brahma beyond which there is nothing. The state of unity or identity is called Sāṅkhyayoga (Yoga of knowledge). Devotion permeates both these forms of spiritual discipline. Thus it is seen that there was no necessity to mention Devotion as a separate discipline. It may be urged here that if such is the case, realization of God will not be possible through Devotion alone without recourse to Karmayoga or JÛānayoga. This, however, is not correct. For the Lord has stated at several places in the Gītā that realization of God is possible through Devotion alone. As regards direct vision of God, He has gone so far as to say that there is no other means to it besides exclusive devotion to God (Gītā XI. 54). The point has been further elucidated in verse 24 of chapter XIII, wherein Devotion in the form of Meditation has been expressly stated as a means of Self-realization—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">ध्यानेनात्मनि</span> <span class="char-style-override-7">पश्यन्ति</span>’. The practice of the form of Devotion, viz., meditation can be carried on along with the two forms of discipline stated above or as a separate discipline. The discipline of Devotion or worship is the easiest and best of all disciplines. The aspirant on this path is backed by God Who is a source of ever-increasing strength to him. Let, therefore, all of us adopt the discipline of pure and exclusive devotion to God without any ulterior or worldly motive and perform our ordinary duties of life with the only motive of pleasing God.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-24">Devotion consists in Exclusive Love for God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no easier path to the attainment of the ineffable bliss arising from absorption into Brahma than Devotion to God. This is true of all ages and specially of the Kali Age. It should, however, be ascertained at the very outset what Devotion is. Devotion is as easy to talk of as it is difficult to practise. It does not consist in mere outward show, it is not something to be displayed; it is, on the contrary, something which should be treasured in the heart and guarded most scrupulously against publicity. The more secret it is kept, the more precious it is held to be. It is very difficult to understand the philosophy of Devotion. Of course, those blessed beings who have dedicated themselves to the All-merciful Lord, do not find it so difficult. The Lord Himself unfolds the secret of Bhakti to those who are exclusively devoted to Him. He rids them of all fears, who betake themselves to the Lord with a guileless heart. Such is His vow.</p>
<p class="Shlok">सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो ददाम्येतद् व्रतं मम॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa VI. xviii. 33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dedication to the Lord is a valuable discipline, indeed; but it should be exclusive. Total and exclusive dependence immediately elicits the desired response from the Lord. Vibhīṣaṇa sought the shelter of śrī Rāma with a sore heart, depending exclusively on His protection, and the Lord unhesitatingly extended His protection to him. No sooner did Princess Draupadī, in the court of the Kauravas, remember Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the refuge of the helpless, having despaired of relief from all other quarters, than the cloth which she was wrapped in was extended in length <span class="char-style-override-8">ad infinitum.</span> These are instances of exclusive surrender. The surrender in both these cases, however, had relief from worldly afflictions as its motive. A devotee should betake himself to the Lord in the same spirit of total dependence for the sake of the Lord Himself. Attainment of true knowledge will then be within easy reach.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Although the supreme idea of Devotion can be understood only by thus surrendering oneself to the Lord. I take the liberty of writing a few lines on this subject on the basis of the scriptures and the utterances of saints merely with a view to amusing myself, even though I do not deem myself competent to wield my pen on this subject, I would crave the indulgence of the blessed devotees of the Lord for this audacity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Supreme, exclusive and motiveless love for God constitutes what is known as Bhakti or Devotion. <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span> speaks of this at several places. For instance—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मयि चानन्ययोगेन भक्तिरव्यभिचारिणी।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XIII. 10)</p>
<p class="Shlok">मां च योऽव्यभिचारेण भक्तियोगेन सेवते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XIV. 26) etc., etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Unflinching devotion to Me through exclusive attachment of mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“And he who constantly worships Me through the Yoga of exclusive devotion.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same idea is found echoed in the Aphorisms of Nārada and śāṇÎilya. Exclusive love is generally characterized by permanent absence of attachment to anything else than God, insensibility to everything else than God in the ecstasy of love and a vision of the Lord in everything that the mind perceives. In this way, as time goes on and the habit of perceiving God everywhere develops, the devotee forgets his own self and the Lord alone remains. This is what constitutes motiveless, exclusive love. The love for God should have God alone or His love as its motive. He should be loved for the sake of love, and not with any ulterior motive. The aspirant should not retain in his mind even the ghost of a desire for honour, applause, high status, or for any other object of this or the next world. Nay, he should not be tempted even by the kingdom of the three worlds. Even if God Himself be pleased to offer him objects of worldly enjoyment with importunity, he should not accept them, and if his refusal displeases the Lord (although He is never displeased with anyone), he should not mind it. The very talk of personal gain should fill him with extreme disgust and abhorrence. Should the Lord make tempting offers of worldly enjoyments to him, he should be filled with remorse and feel that surely there is something wrong with his love; had it been genuine and unadulterated, and had such talk of personal gain really pricked him, the Lord would not have thought fit to tempt him with such offers. In no circumstances should he accept anything else than love of God, not even under pressure of solicitations, importunities and intimidations; he should remain firm and unmoved in his insistence on love. He should continue to believe that so long as the Lord thinks fit to tempt him with offers of variousworldly enjoyments and thus put his devotion to test, attachment to worldly pleasures surely exists in his mind. Had he possessed genuine love, he should not have heard anything else than the talk of his beloved Lord. The very fact that he is still able to see, hear of, and put up with the presence of objects of enjoyment show that he is not yet eligible for true love. That is why the Lord still persists in tempting him. The ideal thing for him would have been that he should have fainted at the very mention of worldly enjoyment. Since this does not happen, a craving for worldly enjoyments surely lurks somewhere in his heart. Such is the form of the higher mental discipline for attaining pure and unadulterated love of God.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The joy which results from the attainment of such faultless love can better be imagined than described. The real value of such love can be appraised only by one who is exclusively devoted to the Lord. Love is ordinarily classified under three heads; secondary, primary and exclusive. For instance, a cow goes into the woods for grazing, leaving the young calf behind, and grazes there. The cow’s love for grass is only secondary, that for the calf is of first importance and that for her own life is exclusive. She can give up grass for the sake of her calf and abandon even the latter for the sake of her own life. Similarly, aspirants of the highest class have their mind exclusively fixed on God even while engaged in their worldly duties. The ordinary type of lovers of God endeavour to concentrate their mind on God; but due to habit and attachment their mind wanders away in spite of themselves to worldly objects, even while they are sitting in meditation or saying their prayers. Those who have God as the main object of their love perform all their worldly duties with their mind constantly fixed on Him, while those who have God as the exclusive object of their love find their Beloved pervading the whole creation, animate as well as inanimate. Such exalted souls are, however, rarely to be seen. (<span class="char-style-override-8">vide Gītā</span> VII. 19)<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* वासुदेव: सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ:।<span class="char-style-override-28"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some of these blessed devotees, the exclusive object of whose love is God, are so deeply immersed in divine love that they appear like madmen in the eyes of the world, while others behave like children. They are no longer able to perform their worldly duties. There are still others who, though equally immersed in divine love, are yet always ready to carry out the behests of their Lord like the great devotee Bharata and Hanumān, the Prince among devotees. All activities of such devotees are directed towards the good of humanity. Such blessed souls do not forget the Lord even for a moment, nor can the Lord ever forget them. He has proclaimed this truth in the following memorable couplet.</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-25">What is God ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is God? All that I propose to say on this subject is my own conviction; it is not unlikely that this may be wrong. I do not assert that the conclusion arrived at by others on the subject is wrong. But I have no doubt in my mind about the conviction I have formed; I am not a doubting soul on the subject, though I have no right to pronounce the opinion of others as fallacious.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is God ? Of this question, the proper answer is that God alone knows what He is. Besides this, the God-realized  soul who has known the reality about Him may give some indication of what is approximate to the reality. As a matter of fact, the reality about God is known only by God Himself; realizers of the truth may give some description of Him in the form of hints or suggestions, but whatever is known and described about Him, He is actually far different from that. The Vedas, the scriptures, the saints and sages have gone on describing Him from time immemorial but their descriptions have not yet come to an end. If anyone attempts to describe that reality either by synthesizing those statements or analysing them, a complete description will not be possible even by him. It will remain incomplete and unfinished. From these observations it is clear that God certainly exists; there is not the slightest doubt about His existence; this conclusion is quite unshakable. Therefore, when a person has taken to the practice of a discipline by forming a certain conviction about God in his mind, there is no need to alter the same, but some improvement in the conviction should, of course, be made. Truly speaking; none of those, who are engaged in the practice of a discipline, is in error; and from another point of view, all are in error. He who starts the practice of a discipline for the realization of God follows a path which leads to God therefore, he is not in error; and yet he is in error, because whatever conception he has formed in the mind about the object of attainment or goal of the practice, the reality is far, far different from it. That which is known, conceived of, and for which a practice is undertaken, is nothing but a hint or gesture to point at the object, God. Therefore so long as that object is not gained, all are said to be merged in error; but this should not lead one to the conclusion that, first of all, the error should be removed, and then a discipline undertaken. None can ever remove the error first; after true realization it gets automatically removed. What transpires before this is a subject of mere inference, and whatever is practised according to inference, is the proper way of realization of the goal. For instance, one has seen the moon on the second day of the lunar fortnight, he now points to it through gesture to another person who has not seen it by saying, “May you look through my eyes, there is the moon above that tree, at a height of four finger’s breadth from the tree.” This statement leads the observer’s gaze through the tree to the moon, and he succeeds in seeing the moon. As a matter of fact, the observer neither sees entering the eyes of the instructor, nor is the moon actually at a height of four finger’s breadth from the tree, nor is the disc of the moon as small as it appears to him. But the eye being directed to the object, he succeeds in seeing it. In order to point out the moon of the second day of the lunar fortnight, some furnish an idea hereof with the help of a reed, and some to make it clearer draw lines with lime or make a pencil sketch of it; but, in reality, none of these has any actual affinity with the moon. They contain neither the brightness of the moon, nor are they as large as it is, nor possess its other virtues. Even so, God may be seen or realized when observed with the help of symbols. But the difference between the symbol and the reality of God is as great as the difference between the moon and the symbols used to indicate it. It may, indeed, be possible for a Yogī to acquaint us with the actual nature of the moon, but none can describe the reality about God, for it is not a thing which can be made subject to speech. It, is known only when actually realized. He also who realizes it, is not able to explain it. This is so far as the Reality is concerned.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it is proposed to explain what should be the object of meditation of the Sādhaka, and how it can be comprehended. What I heard on this subject from saints, or gathered from a study and hearing on the scriptures, and what conviction has got firmly rooted in me through actual experience, will be placed before the reader. Whoever desires may put them into practice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meditation on the real form of God is not actually possible. So long as the eyes, mind and the intellect have no direct experience of God, whatever meditation is practised is based only on inference. But when this is done according to the instruction of saints or the scriptures, of taking a picture or image as model, it is possible for a Sādhaka to realize God. It has already been pointed out that there is no need to introduce any change in the form of meditation one may have chosen for himself. But there is certainly some scope for improvement.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">How Meditation should be Practised</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some Sādhakas meditate on the Unmanifest Pure Brahma, some on His manifested two-armed form and some others on the four-armed form of Bhagavān Viṣṇu. As a matter of fact, just as Bhagavān Viṣṇu, Rāma and Kr̥ṣṇa are one and the same, even so the Goddess or the Female Form of the Supreme Deity, śiva, GaṇeÜa and Sµurya (the sun-god) are not different from Him. It appears that śrī Vedavyāsa composed eighteen Purāṇas in order to portray one God  according to the various conception of the people. The Purāṇa bearing the name of a particular Deity gives precedence to that Deity by declaring him to be the Supreme God, the Creator, possesssed of all virtues. In reality, however, one and the same God has been described through all those different names and forms. The Sādhaka may select the name and form according to his liking. If a person meditates on a pillar regarding it as God, it will be a meditation on God, provided his heart is fully fixed on the thought of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As between meditation on the Manifest and Unmanifest aspects of God, the latter is somewhat more difficult than the former. The result of both is the same; differences lie only in the procedure of practice. Sādhakas should, therefore, meditate on either the Unmanifest or Manifest aspect, according to their inclination or liking.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If worshippers of the Unmanifest aspect of God meditate on the Unmanifest without carrying in their mind the idea of the Manifest, there can be no objection; but if they carry on meditation on the Unmanifest, thoroughly realizing the truth about the Manifest, regarding Him as all-pervading and all-formed, their efforts will more quickly bear fruit. Success will be somewhat delayed if there is want of realization of the truth about the Manifest aspect of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, there is need for the worshipper<span class="char-style-override-10">* </span>of the Manifest aspect to know the truth about the Unmanifest, all-pervading Brahma. This will make his success easier and quicker. In the Gītā, the Lord has extolled the practice of meditation done with a knowledge of his Glory.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-26">* That is to say, those who constantly worship ‘Me’ (Personal God) on the lines laid down in the Gītā chapter XI verse 55.</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यावेश्य मनो ये मां नित्ययुक्ता उपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धया परयोपेतास्ते मे युक्ततमा मता:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XII. 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I consider them to be the best Yogīs who, endowed with supreme faith, and ever united through meditation with Me, worship Me with the mind centred on Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As a matter of fact, meditation done on the Manifest aspect, realizing the glory of the Unmanifest, is the best and easiest discipline for the quick realization of God. The reality about God is, however, different from both those aspects, and cannot be meditated upon. There are several processes of meditation on the Unmanifest. The Sādhaka should adopt for himself whatever process appears easy for him. The result of all is the same. Some of these processes are being described below.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Following the directions given in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>, chapter VI. verses 11 to 13, the Sādhaka should spend at least three hours regularly every day in the practice of meditation in a solitary place, taking his seat either in the Swastika or Siddha posture, fixing his gaze on the tip of the nose, or closing the eyes (as it suits him). If he cannot devote three hours to the practice, let him devote two hours; if he cannot devote two hours, let him devote at least one hour without fail. In the beginning, if his mind runs away from the practice, he may start with fifteen or twenty minutes, and gradually increase the time. Practice of meditation for three hours is indispensable for Sādhakas who desire God-realization quickly. Practice of Japa of the Divine Name renders exceptional help during meditation. All Names of God are equally efficacious— but in the path of meditation on the Unmanifest aspect, precedenc is given to Om. Maharṣi PataÛjali says in his <span class="char-style-override-8">Yoga-DarÜana</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok"><span>तस्य वाचक: प्रणव:।</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(1.27-28)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Om is synonymous with Him. Japa of this should be performed and its meaning (God) should be meditated upon.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These two aphorisms are based on the aphorism <span class="char-style-override-7">‘ईश्वरप्रणिधानाद्वा’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-8">Yoga-DarÜana</span> 1.23) which inculcates surrender to God. The first aphorism quoted above declares the Name of God, and the second advises practice of Japa of the Name and meditation on the Divine Form.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I do not propose here to enter on a discussion on the other views of Maharṣi PataÛjali on God. My intention is only to point out that, according to PataÛjali, meditation on the Form should be carried on together with Japa of the Divine Name, in order to fix the mind on the object of meditation. If any Sādhaka utters ‘nandamaya’ (Embodiment of Bliss), or ‘VijÛānāndaghana’ (Solid Form of Knowledge and Bliss) in the place of Om, there is nothing to object. Differences lie only in the Names; there is no difference in the result.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The best type of Japa is that which is performed by the mind, and which does not require the tongue to move, or the lips to utter any word. During the performance of this type of Japa the processes of meditation and Japa may proceed together with the four aspects of the Anta¬karaṇa (internal organ of perception and cognition). The mind and intellect are the chief determining; first, through the intellect, the Form of God, let the intellect be steadied on it and then let the mind repeat, again and again, the name of ‘ nandamaya’ the all-pervading embodiment of Bliss. This is Japa and meditation, both combined. As a matter of fact; there is no special difference between the Japa of ‘ nandamaya’ and meditation on the same. Both Japa and meditation may be carried on simultaneously. The second process is practice of Japa with the breath. In this process, Japa of the Name is performed through the throat in rhythm with ingoing and outgoing breath. In other words, the Name is repeated with the breath, stopping the tongue and lips altogether. This is Japa through the Prāṇa, or vital air, it is also called worship through the vital air. This form of Japa also is of a superior type. If this practice does not become possible, let the mind be devoted to meditation, and the tongue to utterance of the Name; but in my opinion practice of Japa through the breath will be both easier and more profitable to the Sādhaka. This is so far as Japa is concerned; strictly speaking Japa should be practised during both the types of meditation, viz., meditation on the Unmanifest as well as on the Manifest. Now we shall deal with meditation on the Unmanifest aspect of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Retiring to a solitary place, and steadying himself in his seat, let the Sādhaka practise as follows with a concentrated mind, regarding all things appearing to his sense and mind as illusory, let him go on renouncing the same. Whatever appears to him, let him regard the same as non-existent. Let him feel that the gross physical body, the sense of perception, mind and intellect, all are non-existent; thus negating everything, finally the faculty of negation of the negativing subject, that is, the faculty which negatives objects will also become silent and still. That faculty of negation is also called Knowledge, discrimination and cognition or Pratyaya; there are all functions of the pure Intellect. The Intellect which meditates on God, and negatives all other objects, by saying ‘Not this, Not this’ is its substratum and this is what is meant by <span class="char-style-override-7">‘नेति, नेति’</span> in the Vedas. That faculty does not require to be renounced, it becomes quite automatically. For in the act of renunciation, the three dimensional experience between the subject, object and act of renunciation is bound to appear. That is why active renunciation is not possible in that state, and it takes place automatically. Just as want of fuel will make the fire still, even so in the absence of object, the faculties of cognition will get wholly still. Then, whatever remains as residue is God in His reality. This is called seedless Samādhi.</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्यापि निरोधे सर्वनिरोधान्निर्बीज: समाधि:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yoga 1.5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here it may be urged that after renunciation, the subject, or the renouncer, remains. He is small and God is great. How can that residue be described as God? The question is, no doubt, relevant; but the residue is small, so long as regarding itself as confined to a limited space, it regards the whole space external to it as full of others. When all other objects are fully negatived, what remains as the final residue is nothing but God and God alone. When the objective world is pulled up by the roots and thrown away (from consciousness) automatically God alone remains. When the limitations are destroyed, all differences and divisions cease to exist, and one infinite God is left as remainder who fills up everywhere, and pervades all time and space, In reality, time and space also are fancied in Him. He is the one substance, standing by Himself indescribable and inconceivable. When all thoughts are wholly renounced, it is then that the hidden store of inconceivable Brahma reveals itself, and the Sādhaka gets mingled with it. So long as under the shelter of Ignorance, other objects remained, that store remained hidden from view. With the cessation of Ignorance one substance alone is left behind; under the circumstance, absorption in that substance, in other words, the existence of one object, after all thoughts are stilled, is incontrovertible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sky within the pot is separated from the broad external sky, so long as the pot is not broken, the breaking of the pot is synonymous with the destruction of Ignorance; but this example also does not wholly cover the point. For when the pot is broken to pieces, its broken parts cover some portion of the sky, but when ignorance is destroyed, nothing is left to screen even the least part of Knowledge. With the removal of error, the world wholly ceases to be. Then, what is left as remainder is Brahma. The sky within the pot, in this example, is the Jīva, or individual soul, and the wide, external sky is God. When the limitation in the form of the pot is broken, the two become one. They were one even before, but appeared as different owing to the barriers created by the limitations.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Really speaking, the example of the sky is not entirely applicable in the case of God. The sky is inert; God is not inert. The sky is an object of sight; God is no such object. The sky is subject to change, God is changeless. The sky is not everlasting; it is destroyed during final Dissolution (Mahāpralaya); God is everlasting, eternal. The sky is void, it contains every other thing; God is compact and solid, other things, can have no place in Him. Thus, God is wholly different from the sky. In a part of Brahma lies Māyā, which is called unmanifest Prakr̥ti; in a part of Māyā lies Mahat-Tattva (Universal Intellect) from which is derived the intellect of others. In a part of that Intellect is the Ego, in a part of the Ego is the sky (ether), in a part of the sky (ether) is air, in air is fire, in fire water and in water the earth. From this process of creation it is proved that the whole universe lies in a part of Māyā, and Māyā lies in a part of God. According to this reasoning, in comparison with God, the sky is extremely small; but this knowledge of its insignificance is gained only after the realization of God. For instance, a person is going through the experience of a dream. In the state of dream, he sees the quarters, time, sky, air, fire, sun, moon, day, night and all other things; they appear very extensive; but immediately his eyes are open, the whole of that creation vanishes. Thereafter he realizes that creation of his thought was within him. What was within him was certainly smaller than him, and he is greater than that creation of thought. As a matter of fact, it had no real existence, it was nothing but a thought; but if it had existence it was extremely small and lay in a part of him. And because it was his thought, it was not separate from him. This knowledge comes when the eyes are opened, that is, after awakening. Even so, when the soul gets awakened in the reality of God, the creation ceases to exist.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is regarded to exist anywhere, then according to the statements of saints, it exists in a mere fractional part of God, only in His thought.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is why the example of the sky cannot be fully applied in the case of God. It is true only to this extent, that just as the sky appears formless to the eye of man, even so Brahma is really formless or Unmanifest. Just as the sky appears infinite to the eye of man, even so Brahma is True and Infinite. The example of the sky is cited in order to make these ideas conform to the human intellect. When all those things are negatived, what is left as the remainder; none can describe its character; it is an exceptional, extraordinary thing, Saints possessed of subtle vision, who have realized the subtle nature of things, call it as <span class="char-style-override-7">‘सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म’</span>—“Brahma, who is Truth, Consciousness and Infinity.” He is boundless, unlimited, Self-conscious, the Knower, compact embodiment of Bliss, Happiness itself, true and eternal. These are the attributes to indicate that extraordinary thing. When He is realized, man gets over the risk of any fall. Misery, pain, evil, grief, limitation, distraction, ignorance and sin—all these impurities cease entirely for all time. There is full dawning of one Brahma who is Truth, Knowledge, Consciousness and Bliss. The word “dawning” is used only to convey a faint impression. What actually happens cannot be, as a matter of fact, expressed in words.</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनादिमत्परं ब्रह्म न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XIII. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That beginningless supreme Brahma is said to be neither Sat (being) nor Asat (non-being).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we describe Him as the Enjoyer of Knowledge, then there is no object of enjoyment. If we call Him Knowledge and Happiness itself, then there is no Enjoyer. Enjoyer, enjoyment and the object of enjoyment all are reduced to one. In Him, all triangular experiences (Tripu¢i) cease. This is one method of meditation on the Unmanifest.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Second Process</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seated in a solitary place, and closing his eyes, let the Sādhaka reflect that a flood has come in the ocean of Sat, Cit and  nanda (Truth, Knowledge and Bliss), and that he is sinking deep in that flood; that he is merged in the ocean of infinite Knowledge and Bliss. The whole universe existed in the thought of God. He has renounced the thought, therefore the world including me being annihilated, everywhere one God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss remains. Being engaged in the meditation on God, he (the Sādhaka) is in the thought of God, except Him every other object has been negatived. When God will give up the thought of the Sādhaka, he also will cease to exist, and God alone will remain. If instead of giving up his thought, God keeps him in mind, even then it is a matter of gratification and delight. Let the Sādhaka thus worship the Unmanifest, maintaining his separate individuality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this process, separateness remains during the period of practice, and at the stage of realization identity with God is established, God gives up His thought, therefore He alone remains. This is one process. Besides this, there are other processes of meditation on the Unmanifest, two of which have been described in the chapter on “Means of Realization of True Happiness” to which the reader is referred. In short, there are two methods of meditation on the Unmanifest viz., through the conceptions of separateness and identity. The fruit of both the methods is God-realization in identity. Those who regarding the Jīva (individual soul) as finite do not conceive it as ever identical with God; attain liberation of a limited type. They do not attain eternal liberation. After Universal Dissolution, they have to return. According to this theory of Liberation, they remain separate even after the attainment of Brahma.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, the subject of meditation on the Manifest will be dealt with. The fruit of worship of the Manifest may be of both the types. If the Sādhaka seeks immediate Liberation, or complete union with Pure Brahma, he may attain such union, or immediate Liberation. But if he wants that becoming a servant, associate or friend, he should enjoy Divine Love by living near God, or maintaining his separate individuality serve God by preaching in the world the message of Divine Love, in that case he may attain, according to his desire, any of the types of liberation known as Sālokya (residence with God), Sārµupya (attainment of God’s Form), Sāmīpya (nearness to God), Sāyujya (Identity with God), etc., and after death pass on to the Eternal Supreme Abode of God. Living in that eternal region till final Dissolution, he ultimately gets united with God, or may also take birth as a Kāraka Puruṣa for the redemption of the world, but birth does not cause him any entanglement. Māyā can inflict no misery or suffering on him, and he remains eternally liberated. The Eternal Abode, where such a Sādhaka goes, is above all regions and is the best of regions. Beyond it, there is nothing else but Unmanifest Pure Brahma, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. It eternally exists; in other words, when other regions are destroyed, it remains. What is the character of that region is known to him alone who reaches that region, when all the different imaginary conception about it are transformed into the real truth. Mahātmās say that devotees who reach that region attain almost all the powers and Siddhis possessed by God, but they never make use of them as against the process of God’s creation. He who becoming the servant, friend or associate of the glorious Lord, constantly lives near Him in His Supreme Abode, always acts following His behests. Verse 24 of chapter VIII of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> speaks referring to Sādhakas who go to this Supreme Abode. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Br̥hadāraṇyaka</span> and <span class="char-style-override-8">Chāndogya</span> Upaniṣads contain detailed descriptions of this luminous path; it is this eternal Abode which is perhaps called as Goloka by the worshippers of Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, and as Sāketaloka by the worshippers of Bhagavān śrī Rāma. The Vedas describe it as Satyaloka or Brahmaloka. (It is not the Brahmaloka in which Brahmā resides, and which has been described in the first line of verse 16 of chapter VIII of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>.) In His Manifest Form, God resides in this Eternal Abode. Lack of faith in the Eternal Abode, while having faith in the Manifest aspect of God, is, indeed, a great error.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">How God assumes the Manifest Form for the sake of Devotees</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God, the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, in His eternal, boundless aspect pervades everywhere. Fire may be mentioned as an analogous example in its unmanifest state. Fire is present everywhere, and becomes manifest when effort is made towards it, with the help of materials which can bring it into manifestation. When manifested, the form of the Fire appears equal in length and breadth to the wood through which it is manifested. Even so, according to the wish of the devotee, all-pervading, invisible, subtle and formless God reveals Himself by assuming a Form. In reality, the example of the pervasiveness of Fire also is imperfect; for where there is only ether and air, Fire does not exist, but God is present everywhere completely. Therefore, the pervasiveness of God is superior to all, and most extraordinary. There is no place where God is not. And in the whole of creation, there is no such spot where God’s Māyā is not present. Where there are time and space, Māyā is there. God can, therefore, reveal Himself anywhere He likes through this material in the form of Māyā. Where there is water as well as cold, ice may be formed. Where there is earth and the potter; a pot may be formed. Water and earth may, perhaps, be unobtainable at places; but God and His Māyā are present everywhere throughout creation. Under the circumstances, where lies the difficulty in His manifesting Himself ? What is wanted is only the devotee’s Love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Hari (God) pervades everywhere equally;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through Love, He is manifested; this I have known,”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* हरि ब्यापक सर्वत्र समाना।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">प्रेम तें प्रगट होहिं मैं जाना॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All people can reason about the pervasiveness of the Unmanifest, but in His Manifest Form, God can be seen only by the devotee. God is all-powerful, and can do whatever He pleases. To one, to many, or to all people at once, He can vouchsafe His vision; this depends on His will. True, like the play of a child, that will of His is not tainted with defect. His will is ever perfect. The wish of the devotee also follows the will of God. The Lord said that He resides in the heart of the devotee. This is true. Just as Fire in its unmanifest state is present in our bodies, even so God in His Unmanifest form of Sat, Cit and  nanda is present in every heart, but the heart of the devotee being pure, He can be directly seen there. This is the speciality of the devotee’s heart. The reflection of the sun falls equally on wood, stone and a mirror, but it is not seen in stone. Even so, God though present in every heart cannot be seen in the wood-like impure heart of the man without devotion, and can be directly observed in the transparent, mirror-like spotless heart of the devotee. What may be the devotee’s conception during meditation, in that Form does He lodge Himself in the devotee’s heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Mahātmās say that where Kīrtana is performed, God Himself remains present there in His manifest form. The devotee also engaged in Kīrtana sees Him in that manifest form. This should not be regarded as a mere projection of the mind of the devotee. He sees the Lord truly, and as a matter of fact, what is seen only as an appearance in an act of Māyā. God is, however the Lord of Māyā. The belief of the saint is true that——</p>

<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-8">* “O Nārada, I am present where My devotees sing and chant.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is possible that though present in Kīrtana in His Manifest Form, God is not actually seen by a person; nevertheless it is conducive to spiritual good to cultivate the faith that He is Himself present there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God can manifest Himself when He likes, wherever He likes, and in whatever Form He likes, according to the wish of the devotee; therefore whatever Form the devotee meditates upon, the result is the same. He may meditate either on Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the embodiment of blue-coloured Beauty, adorned with a crown containing the peacock’s feather, or on Bhagavān śrī Rāma armed with the bow and arrow the Best Person who established propriety of conduct. He may meditate either on Bhagavān śrī Viṣṇu, holding the conch, the circular weapon Cakra, the club and the lotus, or on the Universal Form of God. It is all the same. Whatever Form one meditates upon should be regarded as the fullest manifestation of God. Similarly, Japa also may be performed, according to one’s taste and liking, of Om, Rāma, Kr̥ṣṇa, Hari, Nārāyaṇa, śiva, or any other Divine Name; the result of all is the same. Some processes of meditation on God’s Form with attributes have been described in the chapter on “Lessons in Devotion and Divine Love” and “True Happiness and the Means of its Realization.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> The attention of the reader is drawn to them.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-26">* The original of those two articles in Hindi have been reprinted as booklets and may had from the Gītā Press.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it is proposed to say something about the Universal Form of God. The Form which the Lord revealed before Arjuna was no doubt His Universal Form. And this Universe itself described in the Vedas as Bhµu¬, Bhuva¬, Swa¬ (the earth, the intermediate region and the heaven) is also the Lord’s Universal Form. Both are the same. The entire Universe itself is God’s Form. In everything movable and immovable, God is present. To respect and serve the Universe regarding it as God’s Form, means offering of respect and service to God Himself in His Universal Form. The imperfections and impurities of the Universe are not present in God. These are mere sports like the play of the magician. The name and form—all are sports. God ever exists in His own state of being. Like water in the ice, He in His unmanifest state fills everywhere. The water itself is seen as the solid mass of ice; in reality it is nothing. Even so, the Universe is seen in pure Brahma; as a matter of fact, it does not exist.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In his Saguṇa aspect, like the Fire, even though unmanifest, He is all-pervading; He can manifest Himself wherever He likes. This is what has been stated above. This all-pervading God is called Viṣṇu. The word Viṣṇu itself means all-pervading.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">God is above the Guṇas, is endowed with all Guṇas good and bad, and is possessed of only virtuous Guṇas</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No Guṇa exists in God, He is above the Guṇas; all Guṇas good and bad, exist in Him; again He is possessed only of virtues, there is no trace of vice in Him—all these three statements may be made with reference to God. This subject should be properly understood.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The reality about pure Brahma, Unmanifest, Conscious, embodiment of Knowledge and Bliss, and all-pervading God, is wholly beyond all the Guṇas. All virtues and vices in the world originate from Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas—these three Guṇas are included in Māyā, that is why the latter is called Māyā, consisting of the three Guṇas. Among them Sattva is the best, Rajas is intermediate and Tamas is lowest. God is exceptionally different from this Māyā, wholly beyond and free from the Guṇas; that is why He is called Pure. Therefore, He is above the Guṇas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Māyā does not exist in reality; when her existence is conceived of, it is only an imagination. She is fancied to exist in a part of God, virtues and vices all take place in Māyā. According to this reasoning, the entire world consisting of virtues like truth, compassion, renunciation, discrimination etc., and vices like lust, anger, greed, infatuation etc., is superimposed on God. That is why all virtues and vices may be regarded as established in Him. Under the circumstance, He may be described as endowed with all Guṇas, good and bad.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God, the Creator, or Brahma qualified by Māyā, in whom this Universe is included, is not different from Pure Brahma; He manifests Himself subordinating Māyā and incarnates Himself on earth from time to time. That is why He is called ‘qualified by Māyā’. In the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> it is stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IV. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Though unborn and immortal, and also the Lord of all beings, I manifest Myself through My own Yogamāyā (divine potency) keeping My Nature (Prakr̥ti) under control.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as God incarnates Himself on earth, even so He manifests Himself in the beginning of creation, subordinating Māyā to Himself. That manifestation is called Viṣṇu. That Primeval Being, Viṣṇu, is possessed of all the Sāttvic qualities. He is the very embodiment of Sattva. He is adorned with Sāttvic energy, glory, power, majesty etc. The divine qualities are the same as Sattvaguṇa. Pure Sattva is His Form. Vices exist in Rajas and Tamas. Love takes place between those who resemble one another in nature and are equals. That is why, devotees who possess the divine virtues, are said to be the proper persons to gain the vision of God. The Saguṇa aspect of God, qualified by Māyā, comes down on earth from time to time together with Māyā. He is possessed of all virtues. He is pure, free, Lord and all-powerful. There is nothing which He cannot perform. That is why, though in reality Rajas and Tamas do not exist in that embodiment of pure Sattva, the Saguṇa, Manifest Form of God, nevertheless, He can perform acts which are expressions of Rajas and Tamas. Bhagavān Viṣṇu is observed to perform act of violence in the course of chastisement of the wicked. From the human standpoint, this may appear as violence or a manifestation of Tamas; but as a matter of fact violence has no place in Him. Being the dispenser of justice, He has to act according to the circumstance. King Janaka was a liberated soul and was exceptionally Sāttvic in nature, but being a ruler, administration of justice was his function. He had even to inflict punishment on thieves. There is nothing objectionable in this. The mother in order to train up her dear child threatens it, and now and then, when she finds it necessary, gives a slap or two, with a heart full of thoughts of the child’s welfare, but the act is an expression of her compassion for the child. Even so, the chastisement of God, the Ocean of mercy, the Executor of Justice, is also full of compassion. The Kāma or desire sanctioned by Dharma is also God. The Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">धर्माविरूद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ।<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sexual desire not conflicting with virtues is He, not the sinful desire. God is Sat (good); He is Sāttvic. He is pure Sattva. He is imbued with the pure, Sāttvic Vidyā (Knowledge), The Jīva is imbued with Avidyā or Ignorance. In Vidyā, there is Knowledge and Light. How can vice and darkness find any place there ? Vice lies with Avidyā or Ignorance. According to this reasoning, God is imbued with pure, unadulterated virtue.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above discussion proves that God may be described as beyond the Guṇas, as imbued with both virtue and vice, and also as imbued with pure, unadulterated Sattvaguṇa.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Reality about God or Union of the Unmanifest and Manifest Forms</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are three states of the body—the gross, subtle and causal. The body which is seen through the eyes is the gross body, that which goes to the other world after death is the subtle body, and that which gets absorbed in Māyā is the causal body. These three divisions of the body can be seen even everyday. In the waking state, the gross body functions. In the dream state, the subtle body, and in deep sleep, the causal body remains. Similarly, God also may be described to possess three states. That which remains during Final Dissolution is the causal body of God; the whole universe gets dissolved into it and remains there. At that time God and His Prakr̥ti alone remain; all Jīvas get absorbed into Prakr̥ti. In Jīvas also there are parts of both Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa. Consciousness is the part of God, and ignorance is the part of Prakr̥ti. Owing to identification with Māyā, Jīvas do not get liberated even during Final Dissolution. After that, in the beginning of a new creation, they wake up according to their respective Karmas, like men waking up from sleep. In this way, the form of God during Final Dissolution may be described as His causal form.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The subtle form of God is present everywhere; He is called the First or Primal Person. He is the original cause of Creation. His name is Puruṣottama, the Best Person, and God, the Creator.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In his gross form, God eternally exists in His Supreme Abode as Bhagavān Viṣṇu, the holder of the conch, the circular weapon Cakra, the club and lotus.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the very conception of the devotee God assumes His Form. The whole of this Universe is God’s Body, and our bodies are included in that Body. According to this argument we all exist in Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is another truth which should be properly understood. When the sky is clear and the sun is up nothing is observed in the sky between the sun and us, nevertheless there is existence of water there. It will have to be agreed that between the sun and us, the region is full of water, but that water cannot be seen because it exists in the subtle or atomic state. When it becomes thicker, it begins to manifest itself. Vapour is produced by the heat of the sun, when that vapour becomes thicker it is transformed into cloud and the cloud is transformed into water. When the cloud passes a high hill, the visitor to the hill gets his clothes wet even though there may be no rain. When water particles become thicker in the cloud, drops are formed, and when thicker still, hails are formed and rained down on earth. That very hail or ice when touched by heat gets dissolved into water, and greater heat reduces it to vapour, which rising to the sky gets out of sight. Thus, finally, water is reduced to its atomic, unmanifest state. These very subtle atoms of water cannot be seen even with the help of a powerful lens that magnifies objects a thousand times, but water certainly exists in that state; if it did not, wherefrom does it come ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The reality about God should be understood with the help of this example. It is said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अक्षरं ब्रह्म परमं स्वभावोऽध्यात्ममुच्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भूतभावोद्भवकरो विसर्ग: कर्मसंज्ञित:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">अधिभूतं क्षरो भाव: पुरुषश्चाधिदैवतम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अधियज्ञोऽहमेवात्र देहे देहभृतां वर॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII. 3-4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of the seven questions of Arjuna, the sixth was this— What is Brahma? What is Adhyātma? What is Karma? What is Adhibhµuta ? What is Adhidaiva? And What is AdhiyajÛa? In the above verses, the Lord has given His reply to the questions. He said the supreme Indestructible is Brahma, one’s own self (the Jīvātmā) is Adhyātma, the discharge of spirits (Visarga) which brings forth the existence of beings is Karma, all perishable objects are Adhibhµuta, Hiraṇyagarbha, or the Second Puruṣa (Brahmā) as Universal Life is the Adhidaiva, and AdhiyajÛa in the form of the unmanifest, all-pervading Viṣṇu am Myself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This may be understood as follows with the help of the above example.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) In the place of the atomic state of water—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God as pure Existence, Knowledge and Bliss; beyond the Guṇas in Whom this universe was neither ever created, nor exists; who is absolute, transcendent, supreme, indestructible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) Water in the form of vapour—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That very pure Brahma in the form of AdhiyajÛa, unmanifest, all-pervading God, possessed of Māyā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) Cloud</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is Adhidaiva, the life of every being, Hiraṇyagarbha or Brahmā. The collection of seventeen Tattvas is called subtle; among these Tattvas Prāṇa, or vital air, is the chief. The Prāṇas of all beings combined make the Universal Prāṇa; this Universal Prāṇa remains during Pralaya, of partial destruction, but not during final dissolution. The aggregate of seventeen Tattvas make the subtle body of Hiraṇyagarbha Brahmā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) The drops of water in lakhs and crores—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Jīvas of the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(5) Rain—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The action of the Jīvas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(6) Hail or Ice—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The grossest form of the five elements.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The state of this creation is so very gross and transient that the slightest heat will immediately dissolve it, like hail dissolved into water. Heat, in this example, is that luminous flame of wisdom which when produced dissolves the gross creation in the form of hail.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ignorance is the same as cloud Whatever the amount of ignorance, such is grossness; whatever the amount of Knowledge, such is subtlety. The greater the weight of a thing, the lower it falls; the lighter it is, the higher it rises. Ignorance is weight; when water is extremely gross and becomes ice it has to go down; even so the Jīva becoming gross through the weight of Ignorance has to go down.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As soon as the heat of Knowledge is obtained, the weight of the world goes down one’s back. Just as when greater heat is applied to water, it becomes vapour and goes up, even so the Jīva goes up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Jīvātmā (individual soul) is identical with God Himself, but when it comes gross through inertia and Ignorance, it suffers a fall. Ignorance is the cause of descent, and Knowledge is the cause of ascent. When it once rises to the last limit of ascent, the Jīvātmā does not, again, suffer a fall. In its conception, everything becomes God Himself; and in reality, all is but one. Atom, vapour, cloud, drop of rain and hail—all this is nothing but water.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to this argument, all objects, are in reality God; that is why, God manifests Himself in whatever manner He likes, whenever He likes, wherever and in whatever form He likes. When this Knowledge is gained, the Sādhaka sees God alone everywhere. Water is seen everywhere, when the truth about water is known; in the atom it is water, in the hail it is so. In the subtlest state it is water, as well as in the grossest. Even so, one God alone exists in all subtle and gross objects.</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘अणोरणीयान् महतो महीयान्।’<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is union between the Unmanifest and the Manifest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Egoism grows through ignorance, the more there is of Egoism, the more will one take to objects of the world. The more there is the weight of worldly possession, the more will one go down. There are three Guṇas, among them, Tamoguṇa is the heaviest; that is why the person possessed of Tamoguṇa falls low. Rajoguṇa is of medium weight, that is why the being possessed of Rajoguṇa remains among men, in the middle. Sattvaguṇa is light, and the person possessed of Sattvaguṇa goes up towards God.</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्था:’</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘मध्ये तिष्ठन्ति राजसा:’</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘अधो गच्छन्ति तामसा:’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Light things float on the surface, heavy things get submerged. The demoniac qualities are the marks of Tamoguṇa, that is why they take one down. Sattvaguṇa being light takes one up. The divine qualities are the marks of Sattvaguṇa, they are the possession of God. The more these possessions increase, the more the Sādhaka goes up nearer to God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way, one and the same God should be regarded as pervading all gross and subtle objects.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In His all-pervading aspect, God sees all and knows all.</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वत:पाणिपादं तत्सर्वतोऽक्षिशिरोमुखम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वत:श्रुतिमल्लोके सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XIII. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is the character of that object of Knowledge? He is possessed of hands and feet on all sides, eyes on all sides, head, face and ears on all sides. There is no place where He is not, no sound which He does not hear, no sight which He does not see, no object which He does not take, and no region where He has no access.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We offer Him eatables and he immediately eats them. We offer Him praises, and He hears them. He sees everyone of our acts, but we cannot see Him. With reference to this the question arises, how do all the senses of the same Person remain everywhere ? How does the nose remain where the ears are. In reply, it may be said that the objection is no doubt relevant, but the case of God is different from this. His is a transcendent power, and everything is possible in His case. Imagine a heap of gold in which rings, bracelets, necklaces and other ornaments are everywhere present, and all those things can be obtained from whatever points one likes. Even so, God alone is such in whom all things are everywhere present, and everything can proceed from Him. Who can hear, all at once, words uttered at all places by everyone and who can see everyone, all at once.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the state of dream, though there are no eyes, ears, nose etc., the mind itself does every act, and itself sees and hears. It itself acts as the seer, seeing and the object of sight. Even so, the power of God is most extraordinary. It is capable in every way of doing everything at every place. This constitutes His Divinity and Universality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This Universe constitutes the Body of God in His Manifest aspect. Just as ice is the solid form of water but not essentially different from it, is the Universe also just like that? Is God also the physical body ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The reply to this may be given by saying both ‘yes’ and ‘no’. If anyone serves this body and gives comfort to it, I regard it as my service and my comfort, but as a matter of fact I am not the body; I am the soul. But so long as I call this body of three and a half cubits as ‘I’ I am the body. Under the circumstance, the whole of animate and inanimate creation is God, all should render it service, its service is the service of God, and to make the world happy is bringing happiness to God.And when I am not the physical body, the Universe, as the body, also is not God. So long as this body is mine, that Body is God’s. So long as we are His parts, He is the whole. But, really, in the end, it is proved that we are the soul, and not the body. But till it is not so, we should proceed precisely as above. When true Knowledge is gained, one, taintless Brahma alone will remain.<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this point of view, the Unmanifest and Manifest aspect of God are one and the same. The world is a superimposition on God. The Mahātmās say that it is like the conception of the snake in the rope; in reality it does not exist. The world in the dream state appears within us; the water in the mirage is only an appearance. Even so, the world is an appearance in God. The Mahātmās alone know the truth about it. After awakening, it is the awakened soul which truly realizes the falsity of the dreamworlds. So long as this is not realized, means should be adopted. The Means is this—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Through meditation of either the Unmanifest or Manifest form, whatever one and only one supreme object is realized, surrendering oneself to that God, from every point of view, service should be rendered to Him through the senses and the body. Remembrance of Him through the minds, utterance on His Name through the breath, hearing of His glory through the ears, making the body act according to His dictates— these are His service; the practice of this is true Devotion; and through this alone the soul’s redemption may be quickly gained.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-26">Means of Attaining Kalyāṇa (Blessedness)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The state of salvation (Mukti) is called Kalyāṇa (blessedness). It signifies attainment of the supreme state or supreme condition. To attain blessedness, three means are primary— Disinterested Action (Karmayoga), Knowledge (JÛāna or Sāṅkhyayoga), and Devotion (Bhakti or Dhyānyoga). Among them, Devotion may be practised both as a separate discipline as well as with the practices of Disinterested Action (Karmayoga) and Knowledge (Sāṅkhyayoga).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Karmayoga has been described in detail in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā </span>Chap. II, verse 39 to 53, and the marks of the person who has attained perfection through its practice have been described in verses 54 to 72 of the same chapter.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">JÛānayoga has been described at length in chapter II, verse 11 to 30; and, according to it, in chapter III, verse 28, chapter V, verses 8 and 9, and chapter XIV, verse 19—the mode of action of the JÛānayogi has been given. Besides this, chapter V, verses 13 to 26 describe JÛāna (Knowledge), and chapter XVIII, verses 49 to 55 describe the practice of JÛānayoga together with Devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Chapter V verses 27—29, Chapter VI verses 11—32, chapter VIII verses 5—22, chapter IX verses 30—34, chapter X verses 8—12, chapter XI verses 35—55, and chapter XII verses 2—8 deal with Dhyānayoga or Bhaktiyoga. Both these forms of Yoga are essentially one. In other verses of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> also these three disciplines have been described in different ways. Among them, in the present age, the easiest and best means of attaining blessedness is the practice of disinterested Karmayoga together with Devotion. This has been very beautifully laid down in the following eleven verses of chapter XVIII of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">With your mind thus fixed on Me, you shall get over all difficulties by My grace. And if out of pride you will not listen to Me, you will be utterly destroyed.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone. I shall absolve you of all sins, grieve not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a divine teaching! Besides, among books on Dhyānayoga and Bhaktiyoga, <span class="char-style-override-8">YogadarÜana</span> by PataÛjali is the principal book on Dhyānayoga, and the Aphorisms of Nārada and śāṇÎilya are the principal books on Bhaktiyoga.

<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Instead of writing at length, I have only given some hints to the reader by quoting some verses of the Gītā, and giving only the numbers of certain other verses.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-27">The Philosophy of Blessedness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Everlasting freedom from all sorts of pains, passions, qualities and actions and consequent realization of God Who is an embodiment of Supreme Knowledge and Bliss and is Blessedness personified, constitute the highest blessing. It is variously termed as Mukti (emancipation), attainment of the Highest Pedestal of Glory <span class="char-style-override-29">(परमपदप्राप्ति)</span>, attainment of Eternal Peace <span class="char-style-override-29">(निर्वाणपदप्राप्ति)</span> and liberation <span class="char-style-override-29">(मोक्ष)</span>. Every human being is eligible for this state of perfection. The Lord has made the following reassuring proclamation in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्यु: पापयोनय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IX. 32)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, womanfolk, VaiÜyas (members of the trading class), śudras (those belonging to the labouring class), and even those that are born of the womb of sin (such as the pariah), taking refuge in Me, they too, attain the supreme goal.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence he alone realizes the goal of human existence who is freed from the round of birth and death by practising devotion to God and meditating on Him; and attains the highest abode of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A number of misguided statements are made with regard to salvation, of which the following three are more remarkable—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (1)	That, it is not possible to attain salvation in the present age and on this globe and that, householders and low-born classes are not eligible for liberation;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (2)	That, liberated souls are reborn into this world after enjoying beatitude for a considerable length of time;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (3)	That liberation is an offspring of enlightenment (<span class="char-style-override-7">ज्ञान</span>). One can be liberated during his lifetime after such wisdom has dawned on him, even though his mind may continue to be swayed by passions such as lust, anger and vices like mendacity, thievish intent and an inclination to practise adultery. The aforesaid evil tendencies are essential properties of the mind and they must inevitably persist so long as the mind is there, as a result of the force of past actions that have begun to fructify.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All these theories are neither correct nor beneficial and reasonable. On the contrary, they are very harmful and give rise to misconceptions. Hence we shall discuss these points seriatim.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) Mukti (liberation) is brought about by Self-realization <span class="char-style-override-29">(आत्मज्ञान)</span> and the Vedas and other scriptures have prescribed various methods for attaining it, such as Disinterested Action <span class="char-style-override-29">(निष्काम कर्मयोग)</span>, Meditation <span class="char-style-override-29">(ध्यानयोग)</span> and Knowledge of Self <span class="char-style-override-29">(ज्ञानयोग)</span>, etc., which can be easily practised at all times and in all climes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Attainment of liberation has not been restricted to a particular age, clime, caste or order, Mukti can be attained at all times and in all climes and is open to all classes and orders, provided one is endowed with certain equipments <span class="char-style-override-29">(साधनसम्पन्न)</span>. The above-quoted verse of <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā </span>also corroborates this statement. Nowhere in the śrutis or Smr̥tis has the Kali Age or this land of ours or any particular caste or order been declared as debarred from Mukti. The lives of saints and holy men that have flourished upto the recent times also prove that Mukti can be attained with necessary efforts by aspirants belonging to every land, age, class and order. We read in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Viṣṇu-Purāṇa</span>—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once upon a time there was a great controversy among the ¡Rṣis or seers of old as to the period when even a little practice of virtue would bring forth immense wholesome results. At last they all approached the sage Vedavyāsa in a body for obtaining a categorical reply to this question. The sage was at that time having his ablution in the sacred river Bhāgīrathī (Gaṅgā) and the other sages waited for him under the shade of trees on the bank of the river. Shortly afterwards the sage came out of water and made the following utterances within the hearing of the seers—“The Kali Age is truly blessed. O śµudras, you are blessed indeed. Women, you are the most blessed of all, there is no one more blessed than you.” The sages were greatly astonished to hear this and they out of curiosity enquired of Vyāsadeva the meaning of this strange utterance. The sage replied that this was in reply to the question which had been engaging their minds at that moment. Mukti can be attained with very little exertion in the Kali Age as well as by śµudras and the womanfolk. In other ages and among other classes and men, very little is accomplished through great efforts, whereas—</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वल्पेन हि प्रयत्नेन धर्म: सिद्धॺति वै कलौ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नरैरात्मगुणाम्भोभि: क्षालिताखिलकिल्बिषै:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">शूद्रैश्च द्विजशुश्रूषातत्परैर्मुनिसत्तमा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तथा स्त्रीभिरनायासात्  पतिशुश्रूषयैव हि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">ततस्त्रितयमप्येतन्मम धन्यतमं मतम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-8">Viṣṇu-Purāṇa</span> VI.II.34—36)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O sages, in this Kali Age one is absolved of all sins with a little effort only by resorting to good behaviour and attain the object of Dharma. A śµudra can easily attain the highest state by merely serving the three twice-born classes (Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and VaiÜyas), and women by serving their husbands. Hence I look upon all these three as the most blessed.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus it is proved that in the present age and for women and śµudras the path of salvation is easier still.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if it be granted for a moment that Mukti cannot be attained in the present age and is not within the reach of every class and order and that those who are zealously striving for Mukti are under a delusion, one cannot persuade himself to believe that the delusion under which they are labouring is in any way harmful to them. Even if they do not succeed in securing liberation their efforts are sure to be rewarded with good results. They will at least have their Sattva element increased and their heart purified and their divine virtues unfolded. If Mukti is impossible of achievement, it will come neither to one who strives for it nor to him who makes no effort to attain it; but the former will have his noble qualities developed through practice whereas the one who makes no effort will remain where he is. If, on the other hand, it were possible for everyone to secure liberation even in the present age, the one who strives for it will get it, whereas, the one who makes no endeavour to attain it will be shut out of it. How will he be able to attain liberation when he does not strive for it. Thus he will be debarred from this supreme gain through a misconception and will be repeatedly thrown into the whirlpool of birth and death. Hence according to this argument as well, it is but reasonable, profitable and logical to believe that Mukti can be easily attained at every time and in every clime and is open to every class and order.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2)  Nowhere in the śrutis, Smr̥tis, Upaniṣads and other scriptures do we find a statement supporting the theory that even liberated souls return to this world. Only those noble souls who perform meritorious deeds with some object in view and attain heavenly bliss by virtue of their meritorious deeds return to this mortal world. The Lord has said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Those who perform action with some interested motive as laid down in the three Vedas and drink the sap of Soma plant, and have thus been purged of sin, worshipping Me through sacrifices, seek access to heaven; attaining Indra’s paradise as the result of their good deeds, they enjoy the celestial pleasures in heaven.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Having enjoyed the extensive heaven-world, they return to this world of mortals on the stock of their merits being exhausted. Thus taking recourse to action with interested motive enjoyed by the three Vedas (as the means of attaining heavenly bliss), and seeking worldly enjoyments, they repeatedly come and go (i.e., ascend heaven by virtue of their meritorious deeds and return to earth when their fruit has been enjoyed).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are numerous evidences in the śrutis and Smr̥tis to show that liberated souls do not return to this world. The Lord has said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोका: पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII.16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, all the world from Brahmaloka (the abode of Brahmā) downwards are subject to appearance and disappearance. But, O son of Kuntī on attaining Me there is no rebirth. (For I am beyond Time and regions like Brahmaloka, being subject to time, are impermanent.)”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The following śrutis are also very well-known—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘‘न स पुनरावर्तते, न स पुनरावर्तते।’’</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘‘तेषामिह न पुनरावृत्ति:॥’’<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above scriptural texts clearly prove that liberated souls never return to this world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All sorts of actions appear as being duly performed by liberated souls in the eyes of the world; but in reality they have nothing to do with those actions—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्य सर्वे समारम्भा: कामसंकल्पवर्जिता:।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He whose undertakings are all free from desire and thoughts of the world, and whose actions are burnt up by the fire of wisdom, him even the wise call a sage.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He whose mind is free from the notion of doership and whose reason is not affected by worldly objects and worldly activities, even though he may kill all these people, he does not kill nor is he bound (by sin).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Moreover, nothing remains in the eyes of that liberated soul besides one pure Divine Substance which is a mass of Intelligence and Bliss—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वासुदेव: सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā VII. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the very last of all births, the man of realization worships Me, realizing that all this is God. Such a great soul is very rare.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He believes that everything is Vāsudeva. Hence he is called Mukta (liberated). Such a person never comes in contact with this illusory world again; for in his eyes the world no longer exists. How can he, under such circumstances, return to this world ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Should anyone urge that if liberated souls do not return to this world, a time will come when all the creatures of the world will be liberated, with the result that there will be a complete cessation of the universe once for all. In reply to this we say that in the first place this is not possible; for the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span> says—-</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनुष्याणां सहस्त्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VII.3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of thousands of men some rare soul strives to realize Me; of those striving Yogīs, again, some rare one (devoting himself exclusively to Me) knows Me in reality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Under such circumstances it is impossible for all living beings to be emancipated; for they are countless in number. Nevertheless, if a day ever comes when all living beings of the entire universe may get liberated, where lies the harm? A number of exalted souls have striven for this end in ancient times. Saints are still exerting themselves to accomplish this and will continue their efforts in future as well. Should their endeavours come out successful at any time and the totality of living beings inhabiting the universe be liberated, there can be nothing like it. There is nothing in our doctrines to preclude such a possibility.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if we grant for argument’s sake that even liberated souls have to return to this world and that those who believe otherwise are in the wrong, no harm can come to those who entertain such an erroneous belief; for, according to the above doctrine those who believe that liberated souls return to this world as well as those who do not believe like that, both will have to come back to this world. The result will be the same for both. If, however, the theory that liberated souls do not return turns out to be correct, he who believes otherwise will be a great loser, since he will be shut out from that salvation which is immune from rebirth. The poor fellow will, as a result of his erroneous belief, be debarred from this highest gain while those who hold the contrary belief will be emancipated. “From this consideration as well, it is reasonable, profitable and best to believe that liberated souls do not return to this  world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None of the authoritative scriptures such as the śrutis, Smr̥tis, Upaniṣads etc., establish that one can attain liberation during one’s lifetime even though his mind may continue to be swayed by passions such as lust, anger etc., <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmadBhagavadgītā</span> has in unequivocal terms declared lust, anger and avarice to be the triple gate of hell—</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्रिविधं नरकस्येदं द्वारं नाशनमात्मन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">काम: क्रोधस्तथा लोभस्तस्मादेतत्त्रयं त्यजेत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XVI.21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The dialogue between Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa and Arjuna in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span> makes it clear that “desire” is the seed of all sins and that an aspirant can attain liberation only by destroying it by means of spiritual knowledge. Verses 36 to 43 of Chapter III of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span> treat of this subject in detail. How can one attain liberation so long as he is not freed from passions like lust and anger, joy and sorrow. A liberated soul will have really nothing to do with this world. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानव:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मन्येव च संतुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“He, however, who takes delight in the Self alone and is gratified with Self, and is contented in the Self, has no duty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this world that great soul has no use whatsoever for things done, nor for things not done— nor has he selfish dependence of any kind on any creature.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind of a liberated soul is completely rid of all impurities and unsteadiness and stripped of the veil of ignorance and becomes pure. How can under such circumstances passions like lust and anger, joy and sorrow persist in him? The Lord has said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषय: क्षीणकल्मषा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">छिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मान: सर्वभूतहिते रता:॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">अभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā V.25-26)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The seers whose sins have been washed away, whose doubts have been dispelled by Knowledge, whose mind is firmly established in God and who are actively engaged in promoting the welfare of all beings, attain Brahma, who is all Peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To those wise men, who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued their mind and have realized God, Brahma, the abode of eternal peace, is present all round.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śruti texts <span class="char-style-override-7">‘हर्षशोकौ जहाति’</span> (He sheds joy and sorrow) <span class="char-style-override-7">‘तरति शोकमात्मवित्’</span> (one who has realized his Self overcomes grief) and so on are also well-known in this connection. The śāstras are unanimous on this point. God-realization eradicates attachment <span class="char-style-override-29">(</span><span class="char-style-override-7">आसक्त</span><span class="char-style-override-29">)</span>, which is the very root of all passions; how can under such circumstances passions which are the outcome of attachment persist ? These scriptural texts prove that it is never reasonable to believe that passions linger even in the pure heart of a liberated soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is believed that traces of passions such as lust and anger linger even after one has attained liberation during his lifetime and that those who do not believe like that are erroneously engaged in eradicating them, it should be considered whether such a wrong belief leads to any harm. If we consider this question dispassionately, we would arrive at the conclusion that those who strive to eradicate lust, anger etc., are wiser than those who do not engage in such efforts; for those who strive for it will succeed in having greater control over them and thus they will be classed as superior in the rank of Jīvanmuktas. Suppose a man is very much given to lust and anger while another is altogether free from them and both of them are Jīvanmuktas according to the theory enunciated above. Under such circumstances it is natural that the Jīvanmukta who is free from lust, anger etc., is more adorable than the one who is given to lust and anger. Even from this point of view it is advisable to eradicate lust, anger etc. And if it be true that   no trace of a passion is left in the mind of a Jīvanmukta, the one who believes otherwise will not only be shut out from liberation but he will be a great loser in other ways; for (according to <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> XVIII, 22) he will wrongly believe himself to be a JÛānī (enlightened soul) and Mukta (liberated) and will be debarred from the sacred work of mending his character and entangled in the delusive web of lust, anger etc., will be repeatedly thrown into the whirlpool of birth and death, suffering hellish tortures of various kind (<span class="char-style-override-8">vide</span> verses from 16 to 20 of Chapter XVI of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>). Hence one should recognize it as the supreme doctrine that in the mind of a Jīvanmukta passions such as lust and anger, joy and sorrow do not persist. People raise many more kinds of doubts about Mukti; but considerations of space do not allow us to discuss the question any further.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above exposition should have enabled the reader to understand that a liberated soul is altogether free from the three Guṇas or qualities (<span class="char-style-override-8">vide Gītā</span> Chapter XIV verses 19, 22—25).  Hence no passion or seed of action lingers in his mind and hence he is not reborn (in this world). It is attachment to the qualities that is responsible for rebirth. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">पुरुष: प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्‍क्ते प्रकृतिजान्गुणान्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कारणं गुणसंगोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XIII. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The readers must have also understood that Mukti is not something impossible to achieve in the present age. Hence we should wake up soon and apply ourselves to our duty. We have up till now wasted most of our precious time in sloth and inertia and should be wide awake now. One should not waste a single moment of his life. Time lost cannot be retrieved in any way. Hence one should chalk out the path of salvation for himself by means of association with holy men and tread it in right earnest. This is the philosophy of beatitude! </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-28">God-realization through Practice of Renunciation</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासंगं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किंचित्करोति स:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">न हि देहभृता शक्यं त्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते॥<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Living even the life of a householder, man can realize God through the practice of renunciation. Indeed, ‘renunciation’ is the principal means for attaining God. Therefore, dividing them into seven classes, the marks of renunciation are being briefly enunciated below.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(1) Total Renunciation of Prohibited Acts</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is non-performance, in any way whatsoever, through mind, speech and the body, low acts prohibited by the scriptures, such as theft, adultery, falsehood, deception, fraud, oppression, violence, taking of interdicted food and wrong-doing, etc.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(2) Renunciation of Acts Performed for the Satisfaction of Worldly Desires</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is refraining from sacrifices, charities, austerities, worship and other desire-born actions, with a selfish motive,<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> for gaining objects of enjoyments, e.g., wife, progeny and wealth etc., or with the object of curing diseases and terminating other forms of suffering. This is the second type of renunciation.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-26">* If under the pressure of circumstances, one is compelled to do an act sanctioned by tradition and the scriptures, which is by nature rooted in desire, but non-performance of which causes pain to anybody or adversely affects the traditional ways of Action and Worship, performing it disinterestedly, and only for general good, is not an act for the satisfaction of desire.</span></p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(3) Total Renunciation of worldly Thirst</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Honour, fame, social prestige, wife, progeny, wealth, and whatever other transient object are automatically gained by the force of Prārabdha (Karma which has begun to bear fruit), the desire for their increase should be regarded as an obstacle in God-realization, and renounced. This is the third type of renunciation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(4) Renunciation of the Habit of Extracting Service from others with a Selfish Motive</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Asking for money, or demanding service from another for personal gratification, and acceptance of articles and service given without one’s asking for the same, or entertaining any desire in the mind for getting by any means, one’s self-interest served by another— all these and similar ideas of getting service from another for the satisfaction of self should be renounced.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> This is the fourth type of renunciation.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-26">* If non-acceptance of physical service from another, or offer of eatables by another, where one is entitled to accept such service or offer, causes pain to anyone, or in any way disturbs the social order, acceptance of service, abandoning selfishness, and only for the pleasure of the offerer of service, is not harmful. For non-acceptance of service done by one’s wife, son or servant or of eatables offered by friends and relatives, is likely to cause them pain and may prove harmful so far as propriety of social conduct is concerned.</span></p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(5) Total Renunciation of Indolence <br/>and Desire for Fruit in the Performance of Duties</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever duties there are, e.g., cultivation of devotion to God, worship of the celestials, service of the parents and other elders, performance of sacrifices, charities and austerities, maintenance of the household through the earning of livelihood by means of works assigned according to the VarṇāÜrama system and taking of food and drink etc., for the maintenance of the body— in the performance of these indolence and every form of desire should be renounced.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(A) Renunciation of Indolence in the <br/>Practice of Devotion to God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Regarding it as the supreme duty of one’s life, one should hear, reflect on, read and discourse on the sublime stories of the virtue, glory and Love of God, who is extremely compassionate, friend of all, the best of Lovers, the Knower of the heart, and renouncing idleness practise constant Japa, together with meditation of His extremely hallowed Name.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(B) Renunciation of Desire in the Practice <br/>of Devotion to God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Regarding all enjoyments of this world and the next as transient and perishable and hindrances in the path of Devotion to God, no prayer should be offered to God for obtaining any object whatsoever, nor should any desire be entertained in the mind for the same. Also, prayer should not be offered to God for the removal of any trouble even when one is overtaken by it, in other words the thought should be cultivated in the mind that to sacrifice life is preferable to bringing stain on the purity of Bhakti for the sake of this false existence. For instance, Prahlāda, even though intensely persecuted by his father; never offered any prayer to God for the removal of his distress.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Curses with harsh expressions, such as “Let the chastisement of God be on you,” etc., should not be pronounced even against the persecutor or one who does any injury, and no thought of counter-injury should be entertained against him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Out of pride of attainment in the path of Devotion, benedictions should not be pronounced in words, such as “May God restore you to health,” “May God remove your distress,” “May God grant you a long life,” etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In correspondence also, words of worldly interest should not be used. In Mārwārī society, there is a general custom of writing such words of worldly import in the form of prayer to God for obtaining worldly objects, e.g. “God is our helper here and elsewhere.” “God will advance our sales,” “God will bring a good monsoon,” “God will remove the ailment” etc. Instead of this , auspicious, disinterested words, such as “God in His state of Bliss exists everywhere,” “Performance of Bhajana is the only essential duty,” etc., should be employed and other than these no word of worldly interest should be written or uttered.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(C) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire in Connection with the Worship of Celestials</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is God’s injunction to offer worship to the celestials, who are worthy of being worshipped during the time appointed for such worship, according to the scriptures as well as tradition. Regarding the carrying out of God’s behest as one’s supreme duty, such worship should be offered to a celestial with enthusiasm, according to the prescribed rules, without expression of any desire for the satisfaction of any worldly interest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With the object of such worship, words implying worldly interest should not be written on the cash-book, and other account books. For instance in Mārwārī society it is customary on the New Year or Dewali day, subsequent to the worship of Goddess Lakṣmī, to write many words implying worldly desire, such as “Goddess Lakṣmī will bring profit,” “The store will be kept full,” “Prosperity and success will be brought,” “Under the protection of Goddess Kālī ” “Under the protection of Goddess Gaṅgā,” etc. These should be substituted by unselfish, auspicious words, such as, “śrī Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa in the form of Bliss, is present everywhere,” or “Goddess Lakṣmī has been worshipped with great delight and enthusiasm.” Similarly, while making entries on the daily cash-book, this procedure should be followed.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(D) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire in the Service of Parents and other Elders</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is man’s supreme duty to render daily services, in all possible ways to parents, the preceptor and other persons who are one’s superiors in Varṇa,  Ürama, Age, Qualifications, or in whatever other respect it may be, and daily offer them obeisances. Cultivating this thought in the mind, and abandoning all idleness, disinterested and enthusiastic services should be rendered to them, according to God’s behests.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(E) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire in the Performance of Sacrifices, Charities, Austerities and other Auspicious Deeds</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sacrifices, e.g.,the daily obligatory five Great Sacrifices,<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> and other occasional sacrifices, should be performed. Through gifts of food, clothing, learning, medicine and wealth etc., attempt should be made, according to one’s capacity, to make all creatures happy, through mind, speech and the body. Similarly, all forms of bodily suffering should be undergone for the preservation of Dharma. These duties enjoined by the scriptures should be performed with faith and enthusiasm, according to God’s behests, regarding them as supremely important, wholly renouncing the desire for all kinds of enjoyment of this world and the next.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-26">* The five Great Sacrifices are as follows— (1) Sacrifice to gods (performance of Agnihotra etc.); ( 2 ) Sacrifice to Rṣis (study of the Vedas, performance of Sandhyā and Japa of Gāyatrī etc.); ( 3 ) Sacrifice to the Manes (performance of Tarpaṇa, śrāddha etc.); ( 4 ) Sacrifice to men (entertainment of guests); ( 5 ) Sacrifice to all created beings (performance of BalivaiÜwadeva).</span></p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(F) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire in the Performance of Proper Works for the Maintenance of one’s Family through earning of Livelihood</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is God’s injunction that the family should be maintained through service to the world by performing duties laid down in the scriptures for the respective Varṇas and  Üramas, even as agriculture, cattle-breeding and trade have been laid down as the means of livelihood for the VaiÜya. Therefore, regarding them as duties, treating profit and loss as equal, and renouncing all forms of desire, such works should be enthusiastically performed.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-8">* Works performed by a person in the above spirit, being free from greed, cannot be trainted by evil in any way, for in works of livelihood greed is the principal cause which leads one to the commission of sin. Therefore, men should renounce all forms of evil connected with their respective duties as laid down by the VarṇāÜrama system, and perform all their duties for God’s sake, disinterestedly, regarding them as injunction of God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(G) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire in Works for the Preservation of the Body</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In works undertaken for the preservation of the body, according to the scriptures, e.g., partaking of food, medicines, etc., the desire for enjoyment should be renounced. They should be performed, according to the needs of the occasion, only with the object of God-realization, regarding pleasure and pain, profit and loss, life and death as equal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Together with the four types of renunciation stated above, when according to the fifth type of renunciation, all evils and all forms of desire are destroyed, and there remains the one strong desire for God-realization, it should be regarded as the mark of the person who has attained ripeness in the first stage of wisdom.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(6) Total Renunciation of the sense of Meum and Attachment with regard to all Worldly Objects and Activities</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All worldly objects like wealth, house, clothes etc., all relations like the wife, child, friends etc., and all forms of enjoyment of this world and the next like honour, fame, prestige etc., being transient and perishable and regarding them as impermanent, the sense of meum and attachment with regard to them should be renounced. Similarly, having developed pure, exclusive Love for God alone, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, all sense of meum and attachment should be renounced for all works done through the mind, speech and body, and even for the body itself. This is sixth type of renunciation.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-8">* The renunciation of thirst for all objects, and the renunciation of desire for the fruit of all activities have been described above as the third and fifth type of renunciation, but even after such renunciation the sense of meum and attachment for them are left as residues; just as even though Bharata Muni through practices of Bhajana and meditation and association with holy men, had renounced all thirst for worldly objects and desire for the fruit of the activities, his sense of meum in respect of the deer and attachment to the duty of protecting of the deer lingered. That is why renunciation of the sense of meum and attachment for all objects and activities has been described as the sixth type of renunciation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Men who reach the stage of this sixth form of renunciation, developing dispassion for all things of the world, attain exclusive Love for God alone, the supreme embodiment of Love. Therefore, retiring to a solitary place, they like only to hear and relate the stories of God’s spotless Love, which reveal the virtues, glory, and mysteries of God, and reflect on the same, and practise Bhajana, meditation and study of the scriptures. They develop an abhorrence for wasting even a moment of their valuable time in the company of man attached to the world and indulging in fun, luxury, wrong-doing, backbiting, enjoyments and idle gossip. They perform all their duties reflecting on God’s Form and Name, only for God’s sake, and without any worldly attachment.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">(7) Total Renunciation of Subtle Desire and Egoism with regard to the World,<br/>the Body and all Actions</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All objects of the world being projections of Māyā, are wholly transient, and God alone, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, is equally present everywhere—this idea having been firmly established, all subtle desires for the objects of the world, including the body, and for every form of activity have to be totally renounced. In other words, there should be no thought of them left in the mind in the form of impressions. And due to total lack of identification with the body, there should be no trace of any sense of doership with regard to actions done through the mind, speech and body. This is the seventh type of renunciation.<span class="char-style-override-30">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-8">* Even when there is total negation of thirst, of the desire for fruit, of the sense of meum and attachment with regard to all objects of the world and all forms of activity, desire in its subtle form and the feeling of doership persist. That is why, renunciation of subtle desire and egoism has been described as the seventh type of renunciation.</p>

That is why in Chapter XIII of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> (verses 7 to 11) Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa enumerated most of these virtues as Knowledge and in Chapter XVI (verses 1 to 3) mentions them as the divine qualities.</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Conclusion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3"> In this article it has been said that God may be realized through seven types of renunciation. Among them, it has been pointed out, the first five types of renunciation indicate the first stage of wisdom, those upto the sixth type indicate the marks of the second stage of wisdom, and renunciation upto the seventh type indicate the marks of the third stage of wisdom. He who attains ripeness in the third stage of wisdom indicated above immediately realizes God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss. Thereafter he ceases to have any connection with this transient, perishable and impermanent world. Just as the person awakened from a dream ceases to have any connection with the dream-world, even so the person awakened from the dream of ignorance ceases to have any connection with the impermanent world, the creation of Māyā. Though from the point of view of the world all forms of activities are observed as taking place through the body of that person under the force of Prārabdha, and the world gains a lot by such activities, (for being freed from desires, attachment and the sense of doership, whatever the Mahātmā does through his mind, speech and body is accepted as the standard of right conduct in the world, and from the ideas of such a Mahātmā scriptures are formed) yet that person who has realized God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss lives wholly beyond Māyā, consisting of the three Guṇas. Therefore, he during illumination, activity and sleep etc., which are the effects of the Guṇas, does not abhor them nor, when they cease, desires for them. For he views pleasure and pain, gain and loss, honour and ignominy, praise and blame etc., as also earth, stone and gold etc., alike. Therefore, that Mahātmā does not feel delighted on obtaining a desirable object or on the removal of what is undesirable nor does he grieve when obtaining an undesirable object or over the loss of what is desirable.<br/>If for any reason, his body is cut with a weapon, or he is faced with any other form of extreme suffering, that man of wisdom, established exclusively in God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, is not shaken from that state. For, to his mind, the whole world appears as a mirage, and nothing exists beyond the one God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss. What more can we say about him, the mental state of that soul who has realized God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, is in reality known to him alone. None can reveal it through mind, intellect or the senses. Therefore, waking as soon as possible from the sleep of ignorance, and surrendering oneself at the feet of a saint and abiding by his instructions, one should earnestly take to some spiritual discipline for realizing God through the seven types of renunciation stated above. For, this extremely rare gift of a human life is attained only through the grace of God, at the end of many births. Therefore, the invaluable time allotted to this life should not be wasted in indulging in the perishable, transient, impermanent enjoyments of this world.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-29">The Unmanifest and Manifest Divinity</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Beyond the one Eternal Existence which is untainted by Māyā whatever meets the eye is unreal and imaginary like an object seen in a dream. This is the highest teaching of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads and the Vedānta philosophy. This, again, the theory propounded by śaṅkara; nay, this is the only doctrine that stands the test of reason. But the truth is so sublime and esoteric that it is not advisable to lay it open to all and sundry in the natural course at once. There are very few people who can talk and hear of it. He alone is entitled to speak on the subject who has realized this truth and lives upto it, and he alone is eligible for being initiated into it who is ripe for its realization and realizes it the moment it is communicated to him. Those who do not belong to this category are neither allowed to talk of it nor to hear it talked of. Nay, this sort of teaching can even have an adverse effect on those who have likes and dislikes, who rejoice in earthly gains and are upset by losses, who experience joy and sorrow as distinct from each other and who have a zest for worldly enjoyments and are given to the gratification of their senses. They are led into the erroneous belief that , the world itself being a mere dream, sins like mendacity, adultery, violence, fraudulence and chicanery etc., are also unreal, so that no harm can come to a man whatever he may do. Armed with this belief they give up virtuous actions which are difficult to perform and require some effort, whereas it is much easier to give up such actions and to indulge in sinful deeds. Hence it is prohibited in the śāstras to preach this doctrine to those who are unqualified. For, the latter are unable to grasp this teaching in its true spirit, and abandon virtuous actions, while they cannot obtain illumination and are thus losers in both ways. The following Hindi couplet is often quoted in this connection and is very significant—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्रह्मग्यान उपज्यो नहीं, कर्म दिये छिटकाय।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तुलसी ऐसी आतमा, सहज नरकमें जाय॥<span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One who has not obtained enlightenment and has abandoned his legitimate duties paves his way to hell.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसंगिनाम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान्युक्त: समाचरन्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. 26)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“ A wise man established in Me should not unsettle the mind of the ignorant attached to action, but should get them to perform all their duties, duly performing them himself.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The only difference between the actions of a wise and those of an ignorant person is that those of the former are naturally free from attachment while those of the latter are performed with attachment. The <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> says——</p>
<p class="Shlok">सक्ता: कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथासक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसंग्रहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. 25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“ Arjuna, as the unwise act with attachment, so should the wise man, seeking maintenance of the world order, act without attachment.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The long and short of it is that one should not talk of Brahma untainted by Māyā before unqualified persons.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be urged here that when there is nothing beyond the one Eternal Existence untainted by Māyā the existence of the universe as also of its Creator is out of the question. And if this is the case, what will happen to the scriptures that treat of these subjects and the creation as it appears to us ? Our reply to this is that, to take a familiar instance, the sky is devoid of form but sometimes a strip of cloud makes its appearance therein. Now, such strips of cloud spring up in the sky; appear in the sky as well as melt away in the sky; but all these changes make no difference in the substance of the sky. The part of the sky which is covered by clouds, however, assumes a distinctive shape and is the seat of phenomena like rain, etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, that aspect of the one Eternal, Pure and Infinite Existence which appears to be screened by Māyā is known as Qualified or Personal God. In fact, this Qualified or personal God is not something different from the Impersonal Divinity, although He is regarded as different simply because of His contact with Māyā which makes Him appear as such. This Personal or Qualified aspect of Consciousness, which appears as different from the Impersonal aspect, is the Creator of the universe. He is also known by other names such as  dipuruṣa (the Primal Being), Puruṣottama (the Supreme Being and MāyāviÜiṣ¢a ºÜwara (God qualified by Māyā). The universe which appears as subsisting in this Qualified aspect of Consciousness as clouds in a fraction of the sky, is an effect of Māyā (illusion). Māyā is only another name for the śakti or power of the Creator. This power of God inheres in Him in the same way as the burning power subsists in fire. This is also known by the name of Prakr̥ti (Nature) and AjÛāna (Ignorance).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, what is this Māyā and how does it come into being ? This is a different topic and will lead us into digression. We would therefore refrain from discussing the question and revert to our original topic. From the foregoing exposition it should have been clear that the formless, all-pervading, infinite consciousness, which has been likened to the sky, is termed as śuddha Brahma (Divinity untainted by Māyā). In fact, the analogy of the sky, too, is not appropriate and conveys only a partial idea of Brahma. For, the sky has got a limit and, even though formless, it is endowed with an attribute, viz. sound; whereas śuddha Brahma is limitless (infinite), unqualified, absolute and one. Hence it has been styled as Indescribable <span class="char-style-override-29">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">अनिर्वचनीय)</span> and that is why this profound truth can be preached only to those qualified persons who can assimilate it, so much about śuddha Brahma.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-4">Now, that aspect of Brahma which (like the part of the sky which is covered by cloud) appears as differentiated represents the personal God who is qualified by Māyā and is the Creator of the universe. And the whole universe subsists in a fraction of that God—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विष्टभ्याहमिदं कृत्स्नमेकांशेन स्थितो जगत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā X. 4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This naturally leads us to discussion of the embodied or manifest Divinity known by the name of Avatāra or Incarnation. Whenever He finds it necessary, this Personal God harnesses His Māyā and manifests Himself in a form suitable for His mission. He is incarnated sometimes in the human form, sometimes in the form of a boar, sometimes in the form of man-lion, sometimes in the form of a fish or tortoise and sometimes in the form of a swan or a horse, according to the exigencies of the situation, and blesses those with whom He comes in contact with His much coveted vision. But He is never born in this world like ordinary creatures. The Lord has stated the occasion and motive of His incarnation in the following couplets of <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā—</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IV. 7-8)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, whenever there is decline of righteousness, and unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For the protection of the virtuous, for the destruction of evil-doers, and for establishing Dharma (righteousness ) on a firm footing, I am born from age to age.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At this moment I find no such Incarnation of God who may come forward and say that he has bodied himself forth for the deliverance of righteous men. Virtuous men can be had in a good number, but we find none who has come down to this earth to liberate such virtuous souls. Nor do we find anyone who may proclaim like śrī Kr̥ṣṇa—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā XVIII. 66)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone. I shall absolve you of all sins; grieve not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is nobody in world at present who can undertake to absolve anyone from sins through sheer dependence on him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A few days ago a certain gentleman approached me, saying that sins had multiplied in the world and asked me whether the time had not yet come for the Lord to body Himself forth and, if the time had arrived, why did He not incarnate Himself ? I pleaded ignorance in this matter. As a matter of fact, I do not claim to know anything and everything. The Lord alone knows why He tarries. Of course, if anyone asks me whether I shall be pleased in the event of the Lord incarnating Himself I should say I shall be only too glad if the Lord bodies Himself forth, for in that case even I can obtain His vision. If anyone innocently asks me whether in my opinion the time for the Lord incarnating Himself has come. I can say from surmise that the time has probably not yet arrived. For, had the time come the Lord would undoubtedly have bodied Himself forth. Things are not yet so bad as they should be in the Kali Age. Atrocities have not yet grown so rampant, and righteousness and righteous men have not yet suffered so much as they did during the time of other incarnations. During the time of Bhagavān śrī Rāma alone, for instance, so many sages and seers were killed by demons that heaps of their bones had been piled up here and there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Q.—Were not the ancient Rṣis powerful enough to kill the demons ? If they were, why did they not kill the demons?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ans.—The Rṣis did possess the power of killing the Rākṣasas, but they were not willing to expend the spiritual energy which they had acquired and stored up through lifelong practice of religious austerities <span class="char-style-override-29">(तपोबल)</span>. When the sage ViÜwāmitra approached King DaÜaratha and begged him to hand over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to him, he said to him, “Even though I can kill the Rākṣasas myself, I shall thereby be exhausting the store of spiritual energy that I have accumulated through the practice of austere penances, which I am loath to do. On their death at the hands of śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa the performance of my religious rites will be secured against sacrilegious encroachments, and the store of my spiritual energy remain intact. śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa can easily make short work of the demons; it is I who know this and not you.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King DaÜaratha out of ignorance took śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to be ordinary boys, and out of parental affection said to ViÜwāmitra, “Your Holiness, I am prepared to accompany you myself and can kill any Rākṣasas excepting Rāvaṇa, of course; I beseech you, therefore, to let Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa alone and take me with you.” Seeing the Emperor under the clutches of infatuation, the sage Vasiṣ¢ha who recognized the real greatness of śrī Rāma intervened and pleaded with the Emperor thus—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Your Majesty need not be afraid— they are not ordinary boys and no harm can come to them. You may therefore gladly send them with the sage.” This narrative will show that the sages of yore were powerful, no doubt, but they did not want to exercise their power which they had accumulated through austere penances.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kali Age has not yet advanced so far as to necessitate the Lord’s incarnating Himself. Moreover, the Lord does not body Himself forth so easily on every occasion. In the first instance, He deputes His accredited representatives, known as Kāraka Puruṣas, investing them with His own authority, just as the proprietor of a firm sends his trusted agent to look after his business. But when he feels that the deputation of a representative would not serve the desired end and that things would not be set right unless he goes in person, he himself proceeds to that place. In the same way, when the Lord feels it necessary to body Himself forth even after He has deputed a representative, He appears personally in our midst. The privileged class known as Kāraka Puruṣas includes those God-attained souls who after casting off their mortal frame are escorted to the higher regions by celestial beings and ultimately reach the region called Satyaloka, according to the process mentioned in the following couplet of <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अग्निर्ज्योतिरह: शुक्ल: षण्मासा उत्तरायणम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्र प्रयाता गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जना:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII. 24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such blessed being as are destined for the Satyaloka are received in advance by the attendants <span class="char-style-override-29">(पार्षद)</span> of the Lord who are also known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-29">(अमानव पुरुष)</span>  (superhuman or angelic beings), who take them to the highest abode of the Lord with great honour. That abode or region, known as Parama Dhāma, does not perish at the time of universal destruction <span class="char-style-override-29">(प्रलय)</span> and is perfectly immune from affliction and sorrow. One who finds his way into this region once, is never reborn in this mortal world with the bonds of Karma or action. Probably it is this region which is designated as Vaikuṇ¢ha by the devotees of śrī Viṣṇu, and Goloka by the devotees of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa and as Sāketa by the devotees of śrī Rāma. The holy persons who find their admittance into this place remain there in an ecstatic state until final dissolution <span class="char-style-override-29">(महाप्रलय )</span> and are ultimately merged in Eternity or pure Existence <span class="char-style-override-29">(शुद्ध बह्म)</span>. Of these emancipated souls, if anyone comes into this world again at the bidding of the Lord who is the Creator of this universe, or of his own free will simply with a view to work for the welfare of the universe, he is known as a Kāraka Puruṣa (authorised agent or representative). Believing souls can be redeemed merely by seeing them, touching them and thinking of them. Sages like śrī Vasiṣ¢ha, śrī Vedavyāsa and so on belonged to this type of exalted beings. Redemption of mankind is the only motive of their incarnation in this world. We find that the representatives of a ruler sometimes visit the state gaol on some special occasion with the royal commission to release the prisoners confined there and return of their own free will, after carrying out the behests of their ruler. Prisoners as well as state officers visit the gaol, the difference being that whereas prisoners have to go there under compulsion in order to serve the sentences awarded to them for their crimes, the officials go there of their own free will and out of compassion, in order to release the prisoners in bondage. Similarly, the Kāraka Puruṣas, too, make their appearance in the world simply in order to liberate the souls that are bound by the shackles of Karma. The only difference between an Avatāra and a Kāraka Puruṣa is that the former was never a Jīva (a soul in bondage) whereas a Kāraka Puruṣa was a Jīva before and attained liberation by gradual stage through his own efforts coupled with Divine Grace. An Avatāra or even a Kāraka Puruṣa is not to be found anywhere in this world at the present day; of course, Jīvanmukta saints can be found.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mukti (Liberation) is of two kinds— Sadyomukti (direct or immediate liberation) and Kramamukti (liberation by gradual stages). Those who are absolutely freed from ignorance in this very life and are merged in the one eternal, true, blissful and intelligent principle, the whole stock of whose actions has been consumed by the fire of wisdom and in whose eyes nothing remains except the one infinite and endless Divine Existence are called Jīvanmuktas (those who are liberated while living) and are said to have attained what is known as Sadyomukti, while those who reach the highest abode of God through different Lokas or regions are known as Kramamukta. This Kramamukti, again, is of four kinds, viz., Sāmīpya, Sārµupya, Sālokya and Sāyujya. Sāmīpya means living in close proximity with the Lord; Sārµupya means being endowed with a form similar to that of the Lord; Sālokya means residing in the same Loka with the Lord and Sāyujya means oneness with or merging in the Lord. Those who have the attitude of a servant or wife towards the Lord and treat Him as their master or husband are blessed with Sāmīpyamukti; those who look upon Him as a friend and treat Him as such are blessed with Sārµupyamukti; those again, who love Him as a child are blessed with Sālokyamukti and those who think of Him as an enemy or worship Him with devotion mixed with JÛāna (knowledge) are blessed with Sāyujyamukti.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such exalted souls can be found in the world even today. A Jīvanmukta is one who was a Jīva before and was liberated afterwards through his individual efforts, King Janaka and śrī śukadeva are instances of this type.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Among the Jīvas the foremost are those who have been freed from Jīvahood. Next in order are those who have embraced divine virtues and are treading the path of liberation and have very nearly approached their destination. It is very probable that they may be liberated in this very life or they may have to be reborn once again. Such people can be found even now. Like Jīvanmuktas even they are generally not subject to lust and anger, or even to the feelings of joy and sorrow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Q.—The scriptures tell us that there have been sages and holy men, too, in the past who manifested joy and sorrow. How is this to be accounted for ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ans.—Those who are affected by joy and sorrow as resulting from attachment and repulsion cannot be regarded as Jīvanmuktas. But if they occasionally exhibit joy and sorrow by way of duty and in order to preserve a time- honoured practice there can be no objection to their doing so. Lord śrī Rāma Himself wept bitterly on the abduction of Sītā and on Lakṣmaṇa having been hurt with a śakti (dart or spear) hurled by Meghanāda and that, too, in such a way as to confound many important personages. But that constituted an ideal behaviour on the part of śrī Rāma. Moreover, there was one more secret underlying this behaviour. By weeping piteously for Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa he taught the world the lesson of supreme love and tenderness of heart. The Lord has described His nature in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span> as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IV. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, howsoever men approach Me, even so do I seek them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was in consonance with this principle that śrī Rāma accosted even inanimate objects such as trees, boughs and leaves and so on and enquired of them the whereabouts of Sītā and thus proved that just as Sītā who was at that time in the clutches of Rāvaṇa was loudly repeating His name in the ecstasy of love, even so was, He loudly repeating her name with a heart full of love. Similarly, by weeping for Lakṣmaṇa, śrī Rāma proved that His heart was as sore for Lakṣmaṇa as the latter’s could be for Him. From these incidents we should learn that the Lord is prepared to reciprocate our feeling and attitude towards Him. Not to speak of the Lord, even sages and seers can manifest outward signs of joy and sorrow in their worldly behaviour.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So for we have talked of Jīvanmuktas and those who have very nearly approached the stage of liberation. Besides these, there are pious Yogīs who betake themselves to <br/>the Lord with an ulterior motive and who are led by various gods, as mentioned in the following couplet of the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span>,  through the lunar effulgence to paradise, and, having enjoyed the fruit of their noble actions there, return to the mortal world—-</p>
<p class="Shlok">धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्ण: षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII. 25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In former times there were Yogīs who had acquired the eightfold accomplishment <span class="char-style-override-29">(अष्टसिद्धि)</span> or at least some of them. The knowledge of this science has now very nearly disappeared. As a matter of fact, mere acquisition of these Siddhis is not conducive of the highest good <span class="char-style-override-29">(नि:श्रेयस)</span>. One can derive worldly enjoyments and amenities of life from such Siddhis but not Mokṣa or liberation. That is why, the śāstras have recognized these Siddhis as mere stumbling-blocks in the path of liberation and instrumental in securing earthly pleasures alone. The Yogīs who acquire Siddhis generally do not go beyond them, whereas the other class of Yogīs who tread the path of liberation acquire Mokṣa which is the highest accomplishment. Hence they rank higher than the former.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Q.—What are the eight Siddhis? How are they acquired and what is their utility ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Ans.</span>—The eight Siddhis are Aṇimā, Garimā, Mahimā Laghimā, Prāpti, Prākāmya, ºÜitva and VaÜitva. These are attained by following the eightfold path of Yoga, and their utility is as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (1)	Aṇimā consists in making one’s body as minute as an atom <span class="char-style-override-29">(अणु)</span> as śrī Hanumān did while entering the portals of Laṅkā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (2)	Garimā consists in increasing the weight of one’s body to abnormal limits as Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa did during the encounter of Arjuna with Karṇa, when He is said to have brought the chariot along with the horses to the level of the earth under pressure of His body as a device to dodge the deadly dart hurled by Karṇa against Arjuna, for whom He was acting as a charioteer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (3)	Mahimā consists in swelling the size of one’s body at will as Lord Vāmana did while trying to divest the demon king Bali of his kingdom.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (4)	Laghimā consists in making the body exceedingly light.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (5)	Prāpti consists in securing the object of one’s desire as the sage Bharadwāja did at the time of entertaining Bharata who was going to bring his elder brother back to Ayodhyā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (6)	Prākāmya means infallibility of desire.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (7)	ºÜitva consists in acquiring the power of creating the universe, similar to that possessed by God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  (8)	VaÜitva consists in winning over anyone through one’s magnetic influence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These are the eightfold accomplishment. Yogīs possessing these powers are not to be found at the present day. Persons having acquired minor accomplishments <span class="char-style-override-29">(उपसिद्धि)</span>, such as infallibility of speech <span class="char-style-override-29">(वचनसिद्धि)</span>, which can be acquired by the practice of absolute truthfulness, can be found even now.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Q.—It is a fact that whatever escapes the lips of one who practises absolute truthfulness comes out to be true ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">Ans</span>.—Of course, there are instances of this sort mentioned in the Upaniṣads and the Purāṇas which show that such things were of common occurrence in the days of yore. We read in <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> how a young hermit boy cursed Emperor Parīkṣit the grandson of Arjuna, and how the curse came out to be literally true and the snake called Takṣaka bit the Emperor just at the moment predicted by the boy. When king Nahuṣa mentioned in the Purāṇas ascended the throne of Indra (the Ruler of the celestial kingdom ) and, blinded with passion, rode on a palanquin carried by holy men to win over the consort of Indra, and in the heat of the moment kicked one of the sages who bore his palanquin, while asking him to proceed apace <span class="char-style-override-29">(शीघ्रं सर्प)</span> the wise man cursed that haughty monarch should be transformed into a serpent <span class="char-style-override-29">(सर्प)</span> and accordingly the king was Instantaneously changed into a serpent, on being supplicated he predicted that in the Dwāpara Age when the snake happened to catch Bhīma in his coils he would meet Yudhiṣ¢hira and be delivered from the effects of the imprecation. This prediction also came to be true. These incidents prove that every word that comes from the lips of a truthful man invariably comes out to be true. Of course, should such a truthful person ever tell a deliberate lie, that would not come true. Yudhiṣ¢hira, for example, deliberately stated the fact of AÜwatthāmā’s death in a doubtful way; hence the latter did not die. But if one always speaks the truth, there can be no doubt about his words coming true.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">We can also find such men in this age as have brought their mind and senses almost completely under control, who are never overcome by lust, who are never tempted to taste the daintiest dishes with which they may be served and who never gives way to anger and sorrow even in the presence of strong causes. But I have not yet had occasion to see a noble soul whose very sight, touch, speech or thought alone may redeem creatures. For instance, the very sight and utterances of the sage Nārada redeemed millions of creatures, the teachings of śrī śukadeva saved millions, the very thought of Jīvanmukta  cāryas succeeded in liberating several of their disciples and the sight, touch and teaching of śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered thousands. Of course I can say this much that one can acquire such efficacy if he likes, as to redeem others by one’s very sight, touch, speech and thought.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-30">The Philosophy of Worship</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The scriptures as well as the experience of exalted souls prove that the worshippers of both the Manifest and Unmanifest aspects of God can attain salvation. Worshippers of the Manifest aspect can also behold His personal Form, whereas those who worship His Unmanifest aspect are not able to visualize Him, as they do not care to do so. Worship of the Manifest aspect of God comes to fruition speedily when it is accompanied by knowledge of His comprehensive nature. In other words, the worshipper should realize that the God whom he worships is omnipresent and omnipotent. A votary of śiva or Viṣṇu, for instance, should not conceive his Deity to be present in the image only and nowhere else, such a narrow conception of God partakes of the Tāmasa element and has been deprecated in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> (<span class="char-style-override-8">vide</span> Chapter XVIII. 22).<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> This does not mean that one should not practise idol-worship or that one who conceives his God as existing in the Image only and naively worship Him as such without comprehending His true nature should desist from that worship. To engage in worship of any kind, whatsoever, is better than no worship at all. Of course, worship of this latter type; proceeding as it does from a narrow conception of God, bears fruit after a long time. The only disadvantage it has is that it bears fruit after a long time, which is due to the fact that the worshipper belittles his own God by conceiving Him as confined to a particular image only.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* यत्तु कृत्स्नवदेकस्मिन्कार्ये सक्तमहैतुकम्।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">अतात्त्वर्थवदल्पं च तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a worshipper of fire who kindles fire for the sake of performing a sacrifice believes that fire is limited to that place alone and does not recognize its presence elsewhere, he thereby minimizes its all pervasiveness within narrow limits. On the other hand, he who comprehends the real nature of fire knows that it is present everywhere, though in a latent form, which accounts for its invisibility; that it is perceived the moment it is kindled and it can be kindled by ordinary effort. Had it been non-existent elsewhere, how could it be produced anywhere and everywhere? Just as fire, though patent in the sacrificial pit alone, is present everywhere in a latent form, similarly, God as well is equally present everywhere in His Unmanifest form and is visualized by the devotee by dint of his love. It is the Unmanifest which becomes Manifest in a particular place, and the Manifest is present everywhere in an Unmanifest form, the two are really one, or, in other words, they are the two aspects of one and the same entity. One who worships the Manifest aspect of God while recognizing this fundamental unity underlying the two aspects is able to attain this goal speedily. As a matter of fact, God cannot be likened to fire. The analogy of fire has been adopted only by way of illustration; for fire is not omnipresent to the same extent as God. Five omnipresent substances cannot co-exist. Earth, water, fire, air etc., subsist in their respective forms; the main characteristic of earth is odour, while that of fire is colour and so on. God, on the other hand, is omnipresent and the Supreme cause of all causes, and therefore subsists everywhere. An effect can never be comprehensive, the cause alone is comprehensive. Prakr̥ti (Primordial Matter) is the cause of the universe, while God is the cause of Prakr̥ti itself. Hence it is called the Supreme Cause <span class="char-style-override-29">(महाकारण)</span>. Prakr̥ti which is inconscient can be the cause of the inconscient universe; it cannot be the cause of God who is a conscious Principle. He alone is the Supreme cause of everything— He alone pervades sentient and insentient being alike at all times. He does not perish even when all else perishes.<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span> He is eternal and without a beginning.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* य: स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Unmanifest aspect of God is characterized as all existence <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">सत्</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, all-knowledge <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">विज्ञान</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, infinite <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">अनन्त</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span> and a compact mass of bliss <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">आनन्दमय</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>. Sat means that which never ceases to be and never undergoes change, that which is immutable and which is always uniform. VijÛāna signifies wisdom, pure conscious and illumination. Ananta implies that which has no limit, no magnitude which can neither be weighed nor measured, which does not admit of extremes, which is the subtlest of the subtle and the hugest of the huge, and which contains the whole universe in one fraction of it.  nandaghana conveys the idea of Absolute bliss, bliss and bliss alone. Ghana denotes that there is no room in it for anything else than bliss. Just as ice is consolidated water, similarly, God is consolidated bliss. The difference between the two is that while ice has a form and is inconscient and hard, God is formless, conscious and knowledge personified. Such a formless God is present everywhere and fills all space.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The blissful nature of God is beyond description. It is simply ineffable. Have you ever been transported with joy due to some earthly cause? That is nothing when compared to the raptures one enjoys in the company of saints approached with genuine faith, in the remembrance of God or in meditating upon Him, and to which the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> refers in XVIII, 36-37. Sensual pleasure pales into insignificance before this ecstatic joy. And even this joy is a small drop of that ocean of bliss which is known by the name of Brahma (God); any other joy is not absolute, it is limited and can be adulterated.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All that exists is a projection of God who is all bliss incarnate. The whole universe is contained in God just as the reflection is contained in a mirror. Strictly speaking, it is not contained in Him; it is only reflected in Him. Whereas a mirror is inconscient and hard, God is an embodiment of Supreme Bliss and conscious at the same time. He is present everywhere in a compact form and cannot be compared with anything else. His compactness is not analogous to that of stone or ice. These can be penetrated by other substances, but God cannot be penetrated by anything else. The Self (‘I’) in us is so subtle and compact that it cannot be penetrated by anything foreign. The body, the mind, the intellect and so on can be entered into, but the Self cannot. God in His universal and unmanifest aspect is likewise impenetrable.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">His consciousness, too, is of a singular type. Everything that exists in our body is inconscient, and the principle that knows them alone is conscious. That which is knowable is inconscient, objective; it cannot know the Self. Hands and feet, for instance, know not the Self; the Self, however, knows them. It is the Self that knows everything; knowledge is its very essence. That knowledge itself is God who is omnipresent. Every inch of space is occupied by Him. There is no nook or corner which is devoid of Him. That is why the śruti describes Him as “<span class="char-style-override-29">सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्मा</span>”—“Brahma (God) is Truth Absolute, Knowledge Absolute, and Infinite.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Attracted by the love of His devotees and with a view to redeeming them, the Self-same Brahma manifests Itself as an embodied Being and appears before them. It is something beyond the range of human intellect to describe the manifest forms of the Lord which are innumerable. He manifests Himself in the same form in which a devotee likes to see Him. The Lord is not independent in the matter of assuming a particular form— it is His loving devotee who is responsible for His manifestation. Arjuna, for example, expressed a desire to behold His celestial form in the first instance, then His celestial form endowed with four arms, and last of all His human form with two arms only. The Blessed Lord, in order to fulfil the desire of His beloved devotee, appeared before him in all these forms, successively within a short time and also divulged to him the Secret of His unmanifest aspect. In this way the devotee can visualize Him in whatever form he may be worshipping.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence it is not necessary to change the form of worship. In whatever form we worship Him, whether in that of Rāma, Kr̥ṣṇa, Viṣṇu, śiva, Nr̥siṁha (Man-lion), śakti, GaṇeÜa or any other form, the object of worship is the self-same God. Nor is it necessary to make any alteration in the form of prayer. The only thing which requires to be changed is our conception of God, if it is narrow. A devotee should always remember that the God whom he worships pervades the whole universe, consisting of moving and motionless beings, in His unmanifest form; that He is omniscient and the overseer of all that is happening. He is all-wise, all-pervading, all-virtuous, all-powerful, the witness of all, all-existence, all-intelligence and Bliss personified. It is He who assumes different forms and plays different roles as a mere sport in conformity with the desires of His devotees and with a view to redeeming them. God is never invisible to such souls who have understood His true nature, nor does He ever lose sight of them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Himself has said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Bhagavadgītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VI.30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all beings, and sees all beings existing in Me, I am never out of sight of him, nor is he ever out of sight of Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no material difference between the Manifest and Unmanifest aspects of God. It is the Unmanifest that becomes Manifest. The Lord says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IV.6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Though unborn and immortal, and also the Lord of all beings, I manifest Myself through My own Yogamāyā (divine potency), keeping my Nature (Prakr̥ti) under control.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One may ask why He takes a body. An answer to this question is furnished by the Lord Himself in the following words:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IV. 7-8)<span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, whenever there is decline of righteousness, and unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For the protection of the virtuous, for the destruction of evil-doers, and for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I am born form age to age.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way the Lord who is imperishable and immutable, is born in this world of His own free will, attracted by the love of His devotees and with a view to redeming the world. He is an embodiment of love; every activity of His is inspired by love and compassion. He delivers those whom He slays. Even death at His hands is a token of His all-embracing love But the ignorant world which does not realize the true significance of His mysterious incarnations and activities, entertains all sorts of doubts about Him. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IV.9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, My birth and activities are divine. He who knows this in reality does not take birth again on leaving his body, but attains Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God Almighty who is Truth, Knowledge and Bliss personified, is unborn and imperishable, the ultimate goal and the supreme asylum of all beings; it is only with a view to the rehabilitation of the Divine Law and the deliverance of the world that He takes a personal form through His Yogamāyā. Hence there is no one so benevolent, so loving and such a reclaimer of the fallen as God. He alone who realizes this and thinking of Him constantly and with undivided love fares in this world free from attachment, knows Him in essence. Such an enlightened soul never returns to this mortal world, this “vale of tears.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He alone is truly blessed who has come to realize the divine <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">दिव्य</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span> nature of His incarnations and activities. The word ‘Divya’ in Sanskrit is variously rendered as ‘transparent’ <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">उज्ज्वल</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, ‘illuminating’ <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">प्रकाशमय</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, ‘transcendental’ <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">अलौकिक</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, ‘pure’ <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">विशुद्ध</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span> and so on. All these virtues can be predicated of the incarnations and activities of the Lord. Stories of His activities gain currency in the world and impress every heart. They spread their lustre throughout the universe; nay, the hearts of even those who remember and recite them get purified and become transparent like crystal. Hence the activities of the Lord are termed as transparent <span class="char-style-override-29">(उज्ज्वल)</span>. The more they are broadcast the more effective they are in dispelling the darkness of ignorance. Where the exploits of the Lord are recounted daily, the whole atmosphere gets illumined by the rays of knowledge, and the darkness of sins and afflictions disappears. Hence it is that they are called illuminating. The activities of the Lord, again, are not actuated by any selfish motive or self-interest or desire; they are free from all tinge of sin and all impurities. Hence they are called pure. No one can emulate His activities; even gods like Brahmā and Indra are infatuated by His actions. He brings within the region of possibility even that which cannot be conceived by the world at large, that which is impossible. He sometimes accomplishes even that which is improbable. He transcends even Jīvanmuktas (those who have been liberated from the trammels of birth and death even during their life-time) and Kāraka Puruṣas (representatives of God incarnated in the world like God Himself). Hence He is characterized as transcendent. His incarnations are pure in every respect. He manifests Himself by way of sport. He assumes a personal form which is an embodiment of love. Love constitutes His glorious form; hence those alone who are of a loving nature can recognize Him. Those fortunate beings who having realized this truth, worship Him with love are blessed with a sight of the loving countenance of Him who is all-love. Hence we should surrender our all—body, mind, intellect, nay, our very soul—at His lotus-like feet and remain absorbed in His thought day and night. We should always remember His loving command and assurance—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, fix your mind on Me and establish your reason in Me alone; thereafter you will abide in Me. There is no doubt about it.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-31">Rarity of Divine Knowledge</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not possible for an enlightened soul to tell in right earnest even those who look upon him with reverence that he is enlightened for such an admission on the part of an enlightened soul would betray his ignorance. As a matter of fact, one who has got full faith in him would never ask him whether he is enlightened or not. One who asks such a question, should be regarded as lacking in faith, nay, such a question would surely bring harm to the questioner. For, should the enlightened soul declare that he is not enlightened or if he admits that he is enlightened, the faith of the questioner would be shaken in either case. Really speaking, no enlightened soul can make either of these assertions. For, if he says he is not enlightened, he will be guilty of making a false statement; and, if he says he is, he would be admitting plurality and thus betraying his lack of wisdom. He would therefore refuse to make any statement whatsoever on this point and would rather remain silent. This, however, does not mean that he does not really know God for, the<br/>śruti says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नाहं मन्ये सुवेदेति नो न वेदेति वेद च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो नस्तद्वेद तद्वेद नो न वेदेति वेद च॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्यामतं तस्य मतं मतं यस्य न वेद स:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अविज्ञातं विजानतां विज्ञातमविजानताम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Kenopaniṣad II. 2-3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I do not believe that I know God fully, not that I do not know Him, since I know Him. Whoever of us knows Him also knows that neither do I know nor do I know Him not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“God has been thought out by him who takes Him as unthought out whereas he who takes Him as thought out does not know Him. He is unknown to those who presume to know Him and is known to those who deny His knowledge.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence the position of an enlightened soul has been characterized as something indescribable <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">अनिर्वचनीय</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span>, hence it is that both kinds of statements as indicated above are found in the Vedas, and it is for this very reason that enlightened souls do not admit their having attained Divine Knowledge. Instead of offering their own remarks on the question, they simply refer the questioner to the verdict given on this point by the Vedas and other scriptures. They do not at the same time deny their having attained spiritual wisdom. It is hardly advisable even on the part of religious heads and spiritual leaders of mankind having an exemplary conduct, to make such disavowal inasmuch as it may lead their followers to despair of God-realization as something impossible of achievement. Suppose someone who is held in great esteem by the people today declares that he has not been able to realize God and that he himself hankers after that consummation, his followers will conclude that God-realization is something too high for them to attempt or hope to attain, or they may be led to believe that the assertion of the leader is either a deliberate misstatement of facts or at best is intended to disguise the truth. Both these suppositions may lower the leader in their estimation and weaken their faith in him. Hence silence is the only advisable course in such cases. A careful consideration of all these facts proves that an enlightened person can neither call himself wise nor not wise. Notwithstanding all this, should such an enlightened soul, while administering spiritual knowledge to an aspirant to wisdom, assume himself to be wise in accordance with the latter’s conception of himself and even call himself such, just in order to elucidate that point, no harm can accrue from such a behaviour on his part. Even such an assertion on his part is from the point of view of the aspirant only and he can take into confidence in such matters only one who has implicit faith in him and is supremely credulous, nay, who can assimilate the truth as soon as it is taught to him and readily place himself in the mental state which is held up to him as the ideal to be attained. Suppose someone has got the necessary amount of faith and credulity but nevertheless he does not reach the mental state he is expected to reach. It may be urged in such cases that the blame does not lie with the aspirant. Quite so; but at least this much is essential for the aspirant that he should have exclusive faith in one God, the one of whom he has heard from his Guru, and make up his mind to attain Him at all costs and not to rest content till he has done so. Just as one who is apprised of the existence of a treasure trove in his house through one who knows of it, is impatient to dig it out and, if some outsiders happen to be there, he sincerely wishes them gone and is anxious to take the earliest opportunity to obtain possession of the hidden treasure, similarly, a true aspirant is impatient to get rid of faults like attachment, ignorance etc., which hinder his spiritual progress, and is anxious to be brought face to face with God, who is his Supreme wealth, at the earliest moment. The more it is delayed the more impatient and restless he grows till he cannot brook any further delay. If an enlightened soul admits before such an aspirant even in unequivocal terms that he is enlightened no harm can come to the aspirant. But, he does so before an aspirant of an inferior type or before one who does not love him fully, no harm can befall the enlightened soul himself who is immune from all harm, but spiritual harm is likely to come to the listener who is not yet qualified to be taken into confidence in such matters. Had such things been meant to be disclosed to anyone and everyone without distinction, they would not have been termed as secret in the scriptures, nor would they have been allowed to be communicated only to those who were qualified to receive them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be asked here as to what is the test of an enlightened soul; since, if we recognize as unqualified person as our spiritual guide or teacher without duly testing him, this may lead to unfavourable results, according to the scriptures. The question is quite reasonable as also the note of warning sounded by the scriptures; but we can safely treat as our Guru or preceptor one whose company may induce faith in God, in that person himself as well as in the scriptures. Even if he has not attained perfection, he can surely lead us at least to the stage which he has himself attained (when considered from this point of view, intercourse with even those aspirants who live in the company of enlightened souls is desirable and profitable) and during the rest of the journey God Himself comes to his help and sees him through. The only thing that an aspirant is required to do is to betake himself solely and wholly to God. Everything can be accomplished by taking refuge in God. The Lord Himself says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gītā IX.22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Those devotees however who knowing no one else constantly think of Me, and worship Me in a disinterested way, to those ever-united in thought with Me, I bring full security and personally attend to their needs.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Even in our worldly affairs we find that one who solely depends on another is looked after in every way by the latter, just as a child so long as it is entirely dependent on its mother is cared for and guarded against all dangers by the mother. So long as the child does not attain maturity and assert its independence, it is solely dependent on its parents; and so long as it depends on its parents the whole responsibility in respect of it rests with the parents. Even so everything can be accomplished by solely depending on God. Of course, the act of surrender has to be performed by the aspirant. Once he has surrendered himself to the Lord the latter assumes the whole responsibility in respect of him. Hence everyone who aspires after his spiritual welfare must take refuge in God.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-32">The Ineffable State of a JÛānī</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as the mind does not withdraw from lying, violence, sexual indulgence and so on even after they have been decried by reason, even so the mind refuses to submit to the verdict of intellect, reached through analytical reasoning, declaring the world to be merely conceptual or ideal. There is a stage in the life of a Sādhaka when such a thing happens. The Sādhaka describes such a mood by saying that the world is a mere idea according to the verdict of his reason. Latter on, when the mind also accepts the verdict of reason, the Sādhaka begins to look upon the world as mere idea. But even now the Sādhaka only conceives the world to be ideal; he does not realize it as such. Subsequently, when, as a result of continued mental practice, he actually begins to perceive the world a conceptual, the world appears to him sometimes as a shadow, while at other times it ceases to appear even as a shadow. Just as one, who due to defective vision, perceives threadlike streaks of golden light in the sky where there are none, is cognizant of the fact that there is no such object in the sky and that the streaks only appear without any corresponding reality, even so it makes no difference to such a Sādhaka whether the world appears to him as a mere shadow or does not appear at all. At no time and in no wise does the world appear to him as real. Such a stage in the life of a Sādhaka has been designated as <span class="char-style-override-29">‘‘अकल्पित स्थिति’’</span> (the actual stage of experience). This is known as the third stage of wisdom; but even in this stage the perceiver of experience of such a stage persists. A Sādhaka who has reached this stage is apt to err in his worldly dealings on account of intense mental exertion. But reaching the fourth stage of God-realization one is not likely to commit such errors. One who has reached that stage efficiently discharges all his legitimate duties in the natural course as an automaton, without any conscious effort. The Lord has well said in the <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He whose undertakings are all free from desire and thoughts of the world, and whose actions are burnt up by the fire of wisdom, him even the wise call a sage.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* यस्य सर्वे समारम्भा: कामसंकल्पवर्जिता:।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहु: पण्डितं बुधा:॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right"><span class="char-style-override-4">(IV. 19)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even in the fifth stage of ‘illumination’ one is likely to err in his worldly dealings, with this difference that whereas the mood of the Sādhaka in the third plane is acquired, that of the Sādhaka in this plane is spontaneous. The third stage is followed by ‘Realization,’ which is only another name of ‘Liberation’ <span class="char-style-override-29">(मुक्ति)</span>. The followers of certain faiths and creed such as Jainism etc., believe in salvation after death only; but our Vedānta admits the possibility of attaining salvation even during one’s life-time. Saving knowledge or enlightenment can be acquired even before death. The distinct personality of one who has attained this state as well as the actions proceeding therefrom exist only in the eyes of others. There is no individual ego left to identify itself with them. It may be asked here as to how activity is possible in an organism without the presence of a conscious agent or doer. In reply to this it is stated that the Universal Ego <span class="char-style-override-29">(समष्टि चेतन)</span> is present there all the same; the Ego which identified itself with a part has now expanded itself and embraced the whole—merged itself into the pure Ego. And the motive power for activity is supplied by this pure Ego without any obstruction or hindrance. It may be further objected that the Universal or Pure Ego is present in dead bodies and inert matter as well—why then, is there no activity in the latter? Our reply to this is that want of the inner sense or faculty <span class="char-style-override-29">(अन्त:करण)</span> is responsible for the absence of activity in dead bodies and inanimate objects. Should a Yogī be able to multiply his Citta (mind) and introduce it into a dead body or inanimate object, activity can be infused into such a body or object as well.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, if one asks who receives enlightenment <span class="char-style-override-29">(ज्ञान)</span>, we find no answer to this question. If the body is said to be illumined, the statement would not be compatible with reason; for it is not possible for a physical body to get spiritually illumined. If the Jīva (individual Ego) be called enlightened, the statement would be equally incongruous; for the Ego can no longer be called a Jīva after enlightenment. If, on the other hand, we apply the epithet ‘wise’ to the Pure Ego, the statement would be equally preposterous, as the Pure Ego was never ‘unwise.’ Hence it cannot be definitely stated as to who is wise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The concept of an enlightened soul exists in the mind of a person who has not yet reached the stage of enlightenment— in the eyes of the Pure Ego none else exists. An enlightened soul has no objective vision—how, then, can the world exist for him ? Only those who are yet far from enlightenment imagine that the soul inhabiting a particular body has merged into the Universal Spirit—that the portion of the Universal Ego which has the mind superimposed on it, along with the mind, is termed as the enlightened soul. Who in reality receives the epithet ‘enlightened’ nobody can say with the help of his speech, for in the eyes of an enlightened Soul enlightenment itself does not exist. The terms ‘enlightened’ and ‘unenlightened’ exist only for the edification of the world and the concept of enlightenment also resides in the mind of unenlightened souls only. Similar is the value of attempts made at defining the term Guṇātīta (one who has transcended the range of three Guṇas or attributes). As a matter of fact, how can any distinguishing traits <span class="char-style-override-32">(</span><span class="char-style-override-29">लक्षण</span><span class="char-style-override-32">)</span> exist in one who has transcended the three Guṇas. Such distinguishing traits inhere in the mind and every function of the mind is of the nature of the three Guṇas. The fact is that recourse is taken to the method of marking out the distinctive nature of the functions of the mind of a Guṇātīta in order to understand what is meant by the term. <span class="char-style-override-8">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span> characterizes a Guṇātīta  thus—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, he who feels no aversion to light (which is born of Sattva) or activity (which is born of Rajas) or stupor (which is born of Tamas), when they are present and does not long for them when they are absent.”<span class="char-style-override-10">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* प्रकाशं च प्रवृत्तिं च मोहमेव च पाण्डव।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">न द्वेष्टि सम्प्रवृत्तानि न निवृत्तानि काङ्क्षति॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right">(XIV. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord has further discussed the characteristics of a Guṇātīta  in the succeeding verses, viz., verses 23, 24 and 25 also. In the verse reproduced above the word “light” <span class="char-style-override-29">(प्रकाश)</span> should be taken to mean transparency of mind and the cognitive sense, activity <span class="char-style-override-29">(प्रवृत्ति)</span> should be construed to mean voluntary effort <span class="char-style-override-29">(चेष्टा)</span>, and ‘stupor’ <span class="char-style-override-29">(मोह)</span> should be interpreted as the tendency to sleep, lethargy or <span class="char-style-override-29">(आलस्य) </span>(not ignorance or moral delinquency) or a state very similar to profound sleep in the matter of worldly knowledge. Since there is no ego identifying itself with the mind, in whom will ‘abhorrence’ <span class="char-style-override-29">(द्वेष)</span> and longing <span class="char-style-override-29">(इच्छा)</span> inhere? The very fact of the mind being free from attachment and aversion <span class="char-style-override-29">(राग—द्वेष)</span>, delight and sorrow <span class="char-style-override-29">(हर्ष—शोक)</span>, and such other pairs of opposites prove that there is no ego identifying itself with the mind. Had the Universal Ego been tied with the mind, it would have been possible for the latter to manifest evil propensities like attachment and aversion and so on. But the Universal Ego is never tied with the mind— It simply lends motive power to the mind. All these distinguishing traits, too persist only so long as the world continues to make its impression upon our mind, and these are ideal traits to be imbibed by the Sādhaka. Hence it is that they find mention in the śāstras.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The real position of a Guṇātīta can neither be understood nor described by anyone else— it can only be felt by those who have attained that position. Should anyone apply the tests to himself with a view to satisfying himself whether he answers such tests or not, he should be understood as devoid of wisdom. The very fact that he is in search of distinguishing traits proves that he is tied to the body, that he still maintains his distinctiveness from Brahma, otherwise there can be no separate investigator nor can he maintain a distinct position. Again, if he is keen on discovering such traits, why should he seek for them in a particular body alone? What prevents him for seeking for them in rocks and trees? The fact that he confines his quest to the body alone proves that he still identifies himself with the body. He has thus belittled himself already. Of course, if the Sādhaka detaches himself from the body (i.e. looks on the body as a spectator) and compares it with rocks and trees, this comparison may prove beneficial to him, The <span class="char-style-override-8">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“When the seer does not see any agent other than the three Guṇas and knows Me, who stand beyond these Guṇas, he enters into My Being.”<span class="char-style-override-10">* </span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* नान्यं गुणेभ्य: कर्तारं यदा द्रष्टानुपश्यति।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">गुणेभ्यश्च परं वेत्ति मद्भावं सोऽधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Right"><span class="char-style-override-26">(XIV.19)</span><span class="char-style-override-10"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">But he, too, who says that he has not yet received enlightenment is not enlightened; for he expressly says so. Even so he who claims to have received enlightenment should not be recognized as enlightened; for the profession of wisdom proves the existence of three separate entities, viz., the knower, knowledge and the object known. And he, too, who expresses a doubt on this point is not enlightened; for such a doubt cannot exist in the mind of one who has actually received enlightenment. What, then, should an enlightened person say on this point? We get no answer to this question. That is why the position of an enlightened soul has been called ‘indescribable’ <span class="char-style-override-7">(अनिर्वचनीय</span>).<span></span></p>
