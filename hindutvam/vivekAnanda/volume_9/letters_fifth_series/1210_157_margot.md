## CLVII

*To Sister Nivedita*

*THE CALIFORNIA LIMITED*  
SANTA FE ROUTE

*December 2nd, 1899*

MY DEAR MARGOT,

Two nights are passed — today the third will come. If it proves as
pleasant and somnolent as the last two, I \[shall\] rejoice.

The scenery today I am passing through is much like the neighborhood of
Delhi, the beginning of a big desert, bleak hills, scanty, thorny
shrubs, very little water. The little streams are frozen, but during the
middle of the day it is hot. Must be \[illegible\] I presume, in summer.

I send this to the care of Mrs. Adams, (Probably Mrs. Milward Adams.) as
I don't know your address. The Chicago work will not give you much, I am
sure, except in education in the methods here, which I am sure will work
out soon.

With all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA
